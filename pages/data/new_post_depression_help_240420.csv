1c8x0y5;I need help to feel present in life.;Dementor_Fetish;"Hi everyone, So I kind of need a bit of help/advice to be present.   As far as I can remember I never was really aware of being here.. living the moment so to speak.   It has bothered me from time to time.. but not feeling like I'm really here helps me ignore the issue as well. However my dog has been diagnosed with bone cancer.. He is now on pain medication until that doesn't work anymore.. Then we will euthanize him so he doesn't suffer. It is uncurbable, survival chances are extremely low with this type of cancer.  However.. Since I'm ""blessed"" with still having him for his final weeks.. I want to take in these moments. But like I specified before, I simply cant. I'm not here.. I'm a empty shell that functions on automatic pilot.   I can hug him, talk to him.. but I do not realize what's actually happening. Its like watching my life trough a  camera. Some other aspects that might be interesting to know: I have been diagnosed with ADD (ADHD) inattentive type. since a month ago I sometimes take medication to change my neutral days into positive ones.   I also had a traumatic childhood, and I think I can remember the first time I felt this way when I was 12 years old (Basically when the cops entered my mothers house and told her she lost custody of me, I ran outside and started stroking my cat... and for the first time I felt slipping in the void... losing touch with every emotion to protect myself - It is possible that I felt this way before, I just didn't realize it)   I also got taken away from my mom when I was under 3 years old, this created reactive attachment disorder in me.  Anyway, I know the best step would be to seek professional help.. and I will do that in the future. But I was just hoping maybe some of you know what I'm talking about and maybe have some tips on how to be present again.

1c8sce4;Fighting Depression at it's root: Dietary choices;DeslerZero;For me, no amount of practices, exercise, supplements, or life philosophies could undo the energetic damage caused by certain foods.  There are  literally things in certain foods your body will treat as toxins and  that energy will be interpreted as depression - best way I can break it  down.  For me, those foods are wheat, grains (pasta noodles), bread,  oatmeal, cheese, caffeine, cows milk, and excess sugar.  Any one of  those drag me down to depression and a lower energy state.  I have  proven this 100% true in my own life that depression is absolutely  linked to what I eat.  Here are other Reddit post of interest on this  subject that might interest you:     Most will believe depression is related to their feelings.  It isn't quite this simple.  The subtle pushes of these energies can actually lead our feelings to change, thus making it seem as if we are simply  feeling upset about things.   If you do make dietary changes, note it may take a few days to a few  weeks to see changes in your system.  Nothing in the world will fix you  if you don't fix your diet, believe me I tried everything.  Sometimes a toxin is a toxin and all we can do is live our lives without certain  foods.  It's a difficult adjustment but afterwards you'll know how to kill depression from your life permanently.   I hope this thread and the ones linked will inspire you to explore this avenue.

1c8qr7d;A good sex life or a good life?;cntryprthgrl;So, it's weird to admit this but I have had clinical depression pretty much my entire life. I know it, I've been able to exist largely unmedicated and just put on a brave face, but I know deep down my depression and anxiety has been a large factor in my 7 year marriage ending and the end of 3 relationships since my divorce.One of my biggest reasons for not being medicated is that when I did try previously it ruined any sex drive I had. It killed things with my ex husband early in our marriage and things never recovered. Sex maybe twice a year after that because his ego had been so hurt when I had gone on antidepressants.So I haven't been on them again. I have tried to work on things sexually, tried to be more open to things with partners, tried to act more eager, tried to figure out my body so it can perform like 'other women' it's been really difficult and it's still difficult for me to have the kind of sex I assume other couples are having. My most recent partner was the best sex I've ever had but unfortunately I ruined things.My biggest fear is that at 35 I'm at a point of mental breakdown because I can't remember the last time I laughed without it being forced. I have no idea who I am anymore and after my most recent break up two weeks ago which was clearly due to my ongoing anxiety, I'm wondering if I get medicated to have a good life but accept that this will probably mean I'm single because I can't perform sexually for a partner. It feels so cruel because all I want is to love someone and be loved in return but it doesn't seem like that's something I can achieve.And yes, I am in therapy. I acknowledge my faults and I don't want to hurt anyone in the future. I am staying away from dating and friendships.;So, it's weird to admit this but I have had clinical depression pretty much my entire life.

1c8psaw;Advice for helping a friend;eggplantsrin;I'm frustrated trying to support a friend. She's at the point she's basically just in bed all the time. The lack of exercise or sunlight is definitely making things worse, making her more tired, and making her think she needs to sleep more. She has goals to try to get into a routine, starting with a time she wants to be up every morning. But when I offer to come over after that time, she says no because she's never up at all until a few hours after that. She needs to at least leave the house and walk around the block. I'm willing to go over and take her for that walk. I just don't know how to do that. I'm not trying to pretend that going for a walk is going to cure her depression or anything. Anyone who just stays in bed all day though and never gets any exercise or sunlight will become depressed if they aren't already. She's in a rut and I don't know how to help.

My parents split up when I was around 8 or 9 years old because he was in an affair with a friends wife(who he married later).  I wasn't very sociable to begin with. I forgot to brush my teeth once at 2nd grade and everybody  in class started calling me stinky, even thought of a song ""stinky and the brain. By grade 9 everyone in school (about 500 people) called me different names ""Johny Bravo"", ""Zeppelin"", ""Stinky"" etc... , I switched about 9 different homes in one town, then about 7 in another (me and my mom went to live in another city) . My mom had two husbands apart from my dad . One turned out to be mentaly ill child maker( had 9 children between 3 wifes not counting my mom) .  before she got married to her 3 husband, we lived with a guy she knew for a year, he ended breaking her jaw, and I had to stay with him while she was in the hospital. I ""unlock"" a new skill to hear my name mentioned (cause I constantly heard people nearby talking shit about me). meanwhile my father was living in his own bought flat( with his new wife and her daughter). I remember wanting to meet him (father after all ) and he told me he was at work related trip for a few days (usually a week) I wanted to stash my bicycle at his place ( figured his wife was in) for a few hours. and low and behold they come out ( my dad as well) . at some point I  was told I got hep c ,while I was serving the needed amount  for the army in my country(well I got the news after I finished serving and wanted to do it full time). They told me no cause  I am hep c carrier I can forget about it plus no working as a waiter (my higher education I guess). I come To UK eventually  second time ( first time in 2012) and have trouble getting back my insurance number ( have a bit of trouble finding work ) , now i have a more or less stable job (which I hate )  my own place ( bought property) a loving wife.

1c8ji4c;I’m really struggling and the fact that I’m on Reddit looking for help is a testament to that. ;Live-in-the-dream;I’m in my 40s. I’m an American and in Australia. I moved here almost ten years ago to spend my life with the woman I fell in love with and married. After 9 years I couldn’t take the physical and mental abuse my wife put me through and I left. I had started a new job and after finding my ex’s Tinder profile when a coworker saw it, we broke up and another coworker started flirting with me. We hit it off. Fell in love sort of… but there was no future there. My ex found her number on my call logs and decided I’m a cheater and got me fired and harassed my new friend. I moved out. We called off the more romantic stuff but I was still in love with her for almost a year. She had her moments as well but I think I was a convenience (we’re still friends but it’s not fun any more even with platonic stuff and she keeps the night and weekends for others so we only hang out during weeknights sometimes). From every day all day to almost nothing. Moving forward my ex lost her job and so I let her move into my apartment. She moved in and started the abuse again. I tried to kick her out but she called the police on me for trying to lock her in my apartment when I didn’t give her the key. I’m not making this up. I tried to leave and she started hitting me and getting to my key.. broke my phone.. and told the police I pushed her.. which I guess I did while trying to not let her grab my phone but nothing intended to be violent as much as trying to protect myself by moving away and she was in the direct path. Long story but I really do wish someone would listen to me… I got a new job and a receptionist started at the same time. A week in she flirts with me and we hook up. We’re getting romantic and heavy. She tells me she loves me and I instantly melt. I love her too! There’s only one problem. Oh yeah.. she has a boyfriend!!!!! I can’t stand cheaters because of my ex. So I give her the choice. Me or him. I know her answer.. but I was wrong.. I want to tell her bf she cheated on him with me but that’s me getting revenge for my ex. Not cool. When I found out I didn’t do the right thing right away so I’m partly to blame. My boss finds out we’re involved and we both get fired. Her boyfriend was out of town for a week so we spent every day all day together. He came back and now we’re done. Which is for the best. But now I’m at home all day looking for a job. I’m so lonely. I have no friends or family. I’m desperate for someone to love me so I got a dog and she’s my world now but I’m still so fucking alone and the final fix to life has been in my mind daily… hourly… I’m dangerously close to it but I don’t want to… I just don’t want to be alone. I’m also prone to being used because I throw myself at anyone that gives me attention at this stage… so I don’t have the respect I deserve from the women I’ve talked about.

1c8gjq8;Foolproof method to leave;CaFFein3-annihilatr;Hello folks I'm (25F) looking for a foolproof method to end things. I desperately need to find a method that will be efficient and will not lead to me still being here and just ending up paralyzed or anything like that. I have lost my job last year and eversince was considered a burden to my family. Everything I did to avoid causing them any trouble. I tried just staying at home and eventually just locking myself in my room to avoid annoying them but seems that's just not enough as they still lash out at me. I genuinely doesn't want to live anymore as my life have been falling apart no matter how I try to salvage it. As a kid I always followed my parents and strive hard to study and finished college but it seems that that won't guarantee someone's success in life. Still, for years I tried and tried to make my family proud and to be of use to them but I've been unlucky with the previous jobs that I had, and was bullied at some point and my mental health suffered a lot because of that. Now my family thinks it's unbearable to have me around in the house and Philippines doesn't have  any program for the homeless, I don't want to be raped outside and would prefer a permanent relief to my problems. I hope that there's anyone here who can help me find this method. I'm begging. This world is not for everyone, I have done what I can to stay in it but it seems to want to vomit me out of its surface. Please  let me know if you have any methods up your sleeves. Thank you so much.;Hello folks I'm (25F) looking for a foolproof method to end things.

I am not a real man, and the ""man"" i am is ugly and looks like an incel. I know this because i have tried every dating app and have even asked why i don't get likes. All of it the same response, i look like a neckbeard and an incel. I would look better as a mangled body. All i do is wallow in self pity and loathing, i am a lazy pos, and i am not a functioning adult. I have been clingy with my friends but i don't like bothering and annoying them with my constant whining.I haven't cut since valentines day but maybe i should make myself bleed tonight. Or maybe it will just be like any other night recently. Just too tired to do anything.I just want to be held. I have never been held before but i know i don't deserve it. I know what i am, I am ugly trash and i look too much like a creep, everyone has had every right to isolate me as they have. My feelings still hurt but i know it's for the best. I should be abandoned because it's what i deserve. I deserve to die and the universe knows that. I can't afford therapy, i am seen as lazy, (which i am) i have no motivation to keep going. I just live the same boring day every day. Time goes by so fast, i don't want to miss out on life but if i want to die, might as well just wait it out. While i am at it, i should also abuse my body more and make it weaker. I have banged my head against so many walls and punched myself in the head, maybe that will one day cause hemoraging. I have been eating fast food like mcdonalds (not really by choice, i have toxic grandparents) so i guess if i just keep eating mcdonalds i can get a heart attack and then it will just seem like natural causes. They will continue to see mw as stupid because i am stupid. My stomach bothers me constantly (acid reflux, mental health, or ulcer. Doctors have never been helpful) and is only made better because i take omeprazole now but that still doesn't help the fact that i am paranoid about food expiring. If uncooked hamburger looks a little grey, throw it out or don't eat it. My paranoia annoys my sibling and so does me feeling like a burden so i just don't talk about my feelings except to my friends but they have their own lives and don't owe me anything. I have not earned love, i have not earned a better life, i have not earned anything. I want to die, i don't want to cower away like i have always been doing every time i make a suicide plan. I want to find a gun and finish the job. I am unlovable filthy trash, my reason for being here is to die.

1c84rwv;Video Game Detox;Ambitious-Pipe2441;Recently I decided to resist the urge to game first thing in the morning. It’s been a good source of soothing and avoidance from my depression, but a book recently made me wonder if I’m experiencing some dopamine side effects. I can spend all day on video games and as an older man I don’t have the same symptoms that younger people get with addiction, but the constant chase of dopamine may be crippling my remission. Not to mention enabling the more avoidant behaviors.So the book, “The Anxious Generation” by Jonathan Haidt, talks about how people experiencing addiction can return to “normal” after a few days of abstinence from tech. While I think my troubles go a little deeper than just gaming addiction alone, I am curious to see what comes from this.The last two days have been okay, and if I’m being honest I haven’t gone cold turkey. I still play in the evenings, but today the urge has been stronger. I’m really fighting the pull to sit down at the computer and jack in. It does feel a little like an addiction today. Which ~~May~~  maybe coming from feelings of tiredness. Also my wife left for a doctors appointment which is like having guilt free me time.I also noticed this a few days ago with my phone. My mind was racing when I woke up and I felt the urge to reach for my phone to quiet my brain, but I rode it out and eventually got to a quieter place on my own.Supposedly things normalize in about three days and today is essentially day three. Though I’m expecting it to take a little longer since I haven’t completely stopped. But we’ll see if it helps. So far my experience has been small degrees of change. I’ll take what I can get.;Recently I decided to resist the urge to game first thing in the morning.

1c7u165;I'm tired;Frosty-Bluebird6042;I (24F) have spent my whole life working hard. I am tired. I spent all my school life working to get good grades and I was always a great performer.I skipped a class too because I was good. I have always been a thought child though. Always thinking, asking questions - which my parents didn't like. And I didn't always agree to something just because they said so. I was always the kid who wanted to know why.I come from a middle class family (Not USA or UK) Here middle class means we can eat comfortably. But we don't really do luxuries.I'm a first born daughter, so that has its effects.I did my undergrad in Architecture, it worsened or grew my anxiety , taught me a culture of overwork and self neglect and I realised the industry isn't too different from school and the pay isn't worth it. So I'm my 4th year I got the idea to transition to UIUX. Due to the limitations at home, it took me too long and I ended up finishing my bootcamp last year. I took a gap year from school to pursue the transition and did a lot of freelance projects and built up my skills. I have, however been unable to penetrate Upwork. I started applying for jobs this year, I'm in my final year of architecture school, I still live with my parents and have no stable source of income and this is the worst market for junior Product designers especially for remote roles. I've tried everything, including applying for free projects just to get a foot into the market. My parents are starting to put pressure on me to figure things out. They say I work too much and it's all pointless.It's a lot of pressure. Even on myself as I have been trying to move out to give myself a more supportive environment especially from my parents. They have constantly mocked me for all the work I've been doing. They resent me not wanting to pursue the degree I did as a career despite its clear effects on my mental and physical health. And my mom, who has her own problems with my dad, projects them on me constantly.I have a boyfriend. We've been together more than a year. He is aware of my extreme anxiety and mental health challenges and quite supportive. But I'm afraid it might be getting to much.Lately I've been having longer, more frequent anxiety attacks as well as bouts of depression. I managed to find a free therapy service for myself but it doesn't start until next week. I'm afraid it might be due to hormonal changes from an implant I've had the last for years and I'll get it removed just to see whether I'll be more emotionally stable.But I'm also aware I'm under a lot of pressure.With every attack I feel like I might not be meant for this life. I consider suicide more and more often. I wish I would die in various circumstances.I feel my life and my work has been a waste. My experience or efforts seem not to leave any room to make a living for me. I feel broken and like maybe I just don't know the secret to life or how to live.

I wish I could say my environment has something to do with it but that's not true. I've discovered over the last few years it's just my mind. It's broken... Even when I had the world at my hands I would be down (mentally) for however long it decided to stay. Naturally there are good times too and when those come I can't imagine why I would ever be depressed but wake up the next day feeling so low wondering how to get back to the day before. I'm so tired of fighting with my mind. It would be so much easier to just end it all but my family needs me so here I am. I could never truly explain what goes on in my head but it's atleast comforting to know I am not the only one fighting for another day.

It's been 14/30 days that she's been in residential now, on her own. Things were going ok when we first got together, because she was happy that someone finally cared about her, and would listen, then her therapist misunderstood something she said, and 1013'd her, which threw her back down into the hole she fought so hard to claw out of. It hurts me to see her in pain and I can't do anything about it. Ever since she went to residential it's been worse. She's harmed herself 3-4 times at residential. And they won't let her discharge early due to that. It really hurts to see her in pain. Her mom didn't ""support"" her decision to go to residential, so in turn she will be taking her car, and some other things, basically as punishment. So l'm really the only one who 100% cares for her and her wellbeing. I've found myself thinking every day, is she ever gonna get better? Am I gonna have to deal with the person I love the most harming themselves the rest of my life? And the constant chance she runs her car off the road because her impulse finally wins. What is gonna happen when she gets post partum depression?these things were only created about 3 years ago, but residential place has changed ALL of her medicine, had her on some l've never heard of, lithium, and Ativan. So when she gets out she's gonna have to come back off of some. I should note it's her 3rd-4th time. I've caught myself constantly thinking these things, obviously l'm not gonna leave her/don't want to leave her, she's given me things nobody has ever really given me, like... quite literally, love.

1c6xlqs;I did something terrible when I was 11 and the guilt won't go away.;Sea_Fee1519;"I did something when I was 11. What I did was undisputably bad, But I got away with it. No one ever knew. To this day I remain the only one who knows of what I did. For years this guilt has been eating at me and every time I think I've forgotten about this and try to move on it comes back. Every time I'm at my lowest I find it waiting for me. All I've told people is that I've done somthing bad, never what it is, and not even the nature of what it was. Everyone always says the same things : ""But you were only 11"", ""You were a kid, you didn't know what you were doing"", ""Whatever it was it's not your fault"", ""You were just a kid, plus you regret it and haven't repeate it"". Or something alog those lines. That last one hurts the most (I haven't repeated it), because just because you only did something once doesn't mean you didn't do it. Even if I was a kid at the time and didn't know much, I knew more than enough to understand that what I was doing was very wrong, but that didn't stop me. I did it anyways. I thank relegion for keeping me alive this long. Though at times luck had to intervene and help as well. However I now find myself losing touch with religion and I don't know if I have eonugh in me to keep going without it.  Growing up since that day I built a false perception around myself to protect me. I made a promise to myself, one I haven't been able to break to this day; to never tell anyone what I did no matter how close to them I am. To stop thinking about ending it all I started preaching to myself and others that scuicide is a cowards way out. That it was the single most selfish act you could commit. That when you do it, you never think of how this will afect everyone around you. Or worse, you delude yourself into thinking that they would be better off with you gone. I started socialising more and made new friends and got closer with my family. To keep failure from putting me down I beleived that failure is a chance to learn something new. All guardrails I put in place to keep me from the edge.  But now as I sit here typing this I fear the guardrail has rusted and crumbled. This pain in my head I keep describing and no one seems to know whats wrong. I hear my name being called by a voice I know all too well. Every time I'm near the edge of a building a cliff a height of any kind I have this fear but not from the height rather from myself, the sudden urge to want to jump to wish to trip to slip into a road get hit by a bus anything!! Everytime I'm at a beach I swim as far as the lifeguards let me and then with one big breath I take a dive and try to reach the bottom. I brag and tell everyone I did it, but secretly I'm upset I didn't drown. I've wanted to die for far too long. I say it as a joke but I mean it. Not too long ago I started saying ""I don't want to kill myself, but I wouldn't mind if a truck hit me"".  I value life more than most, and I think my own thoughts are stupid in nature. Alot has happened to me since then. Some really good things and some reallyy fucked up. I'm not upset by what happens now, I'm more upset by whats in the past. I know it can't change cause if I could go back I would. But I know I can't and I understand that the only way to move now is forward. But I feel tired and empty inside, all this guilt won't let me sleep. I sleep once every 2 to 3 days and sometimes not even that. My relationship with my family has been falling apart. I can't trust to get close to a woman, I don't think it's because my exgirlfriend cheated on me with my bestfreind's girlfriend, but rather because I'm worried that if I let them get too close to me they'll see what I've been hiding all these years.  Though I dindn't cause death, I feel like I deserve it. I tried looking to see how people who've hurt others, wether out of malice or self defense or any other reason, cope with it and move on with their lives thinking it would help. But it didn't.  I'm slowly being pushed towards the edge and the scariest thing isn't the fall, but that I'm the one pushing me. How do I move on. Time hasn't healed me and I don't know what will. Even If I can't heal what can I hold on to. Friends and family I have but it's not enough, I don't care if it's selfish anymore. So I ask again: Please tell me what can I hold on to?";I did something when I was 11. What I did was undisputably bad, But I got away with it.

My best friend of 12 years was the one person I truly felt connected to. We were more like soul mates, we called ourselves siblings, it was more than a friendship she was truly my sister. I was having a particularly dark day, really didn't want to be here, and while we were talking I basically said something along the lines of ""You, my mom, and my cat are the only things holding me here. Sometimes I wish you'd all just drop dead so I would be able to kill myself without guilt."" It wasn’t something I really meant, and she knew that. She didn't take it personal or even really acknowledge it, I know she knew I didn't actually want her to die because that was the last thing I wanted. I couldn't have imagined my life without her. She was my rock, my safety net, the one person I told everything to. We planned to get a house and grow old together.That same night she passed away. Completely unexpected, not intentional. Her mom told me the coroner's said she went fast, probably didn't even realize it was happening. God I hope that's true.Now, along with my grief, I feel so fucking guilty. I can't believe I said that and then it happened. It feels like it's my fault, like I willed it into being through my words alone. I want nothing more than to follow her, but I still have my mom and my cat to think about, plus I know she wouldn’t want me to die she literally told me so during that final conversation. So I'm forcing myself to carry on for her, but now I have so much anxiety that my mom and cat are gonna go too. Like the universe will punish me for saying it. I'm terrified that I'm about to lose everything that matters to me and I'll only have myself to blame. I hate myself so fucking much. I can't get it out of my head, and I can't stop panicking that my mom is next. That's my biggest fear in all my life, and now I'm worrying that I'm manifesting it by thinking about it on loop. Is there any way I can learn to forgive myself and accept it wasn't my fault? And that my mom and cat aren't just gonna keel over because of my stupid words? I'm so so scared. I just don't know what to do anymore...";I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time.

1c6iyd3;Depression just feels numb now;FriendshipScary5850;"Im chucking this out there just as a fuck it why not type of thing and to try to wrap my head around what's going on with me. Truth is, at 22, I'm nowhere near where thought I'd be by now.Been battling with depression since was 16. It's been a real rollercoaster, you know? Some days, I'm like, ""Let's end this""' but then chicken out. Weird, right? Can't even tell if it's just how I'm wired or if life's just been hitting me hard from the get-go. But one thing's for sure, I've always had this itch to vanish completely, like off to some deserted island or hiding out in the woods like Walter White. And l'm not picky about how it ends, quick or slow, 'cause deep down, I feel like deserve it. Living feels like a never-ending struggle, yet don't feel like deserve to keep going. I'm so numb these days that I catch myself finding dark humour in my suicidal thoughts. It's messed up, I know, but it's been so long that it's just a part of who am now, shaping every bit of me.I've gotten so used to these thoughts that they're like my default setting. It's like they've become part of my identity, you know? And the thought of not feeling this way scares the hell out of me 'cause it's like, what else have got? No friends, no social life, just me holed up at home for weeks on end. That's been my life for ages now, and I've kinda made peace with it. It's like I'm scared to lose this messed-up part of me that defines who am. Everything I've done has been with this wanna check out"" and ""l'm all alone"" mindset. And hitting 23 soon? That's a wake-up call in itself as I've always had this thought in the back of my head from young that I wouldn't make it passed 24. Usually, l'd be bawling my eyes out thinking like this. But now? Nah, I'm just blank, empty. I'm craving some sort of release, feeling like l'm at the end of my rope. I feel pathetic, like I'm just stumbling through life with no clue where I'm headed.I barely feel like a person anymore. It's been a downward spiral, and can't bring myself to open up about it to anyone. My family's in the dark about it all, and even my girlfriend, bless her heart, only knows bits and pieces 'cause it's tough to deal with these things when you're long distance and honestly recently I feel like I'm just a burden on her and she deserves better. And honestly, I reckon l'd just drain her energy if I let it all out. I doubt anyone gets how deep these thoughts run. Opening up to my parents? That's a can of worms I'm not ready to crack open. And don't even get me started on seeking professional help. That'd slam shut doors l'd never get open again. Graduated uni, but job hunting's been a bust. I thought it'd be my ticket out, a fresh start, but no dice.Sleep's been a joke lately, barely scraping a few hours a night. Always tired, always on the edge of losing it. Ijust want some relief, man. Physically, entally, emotionally, spiritually-I'm just yearning for a way out. I used to be all fit and and cheerful surrounded by mates. Now? I'm just a lonely fat piece of shit and even hitting the gym does bugger all for me. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Feels like this is the end of the road for me.Sorry for rambling on. Just needed to let it all out, you know?

I’m reaching out because I’m in the midst of rolling out something pretty exciting—something born from my own tough ride through the challenges of mental health. My therapist used to say, “I don’t believe in solutions, I believe in understanding,” this has pointed me in the following direction:  There’s a glaring gap in how hope is communicated in mental health care, and I think we can start to bridge that gap together. We're building a platform to showcase real stories of mental health success and recovery. And by success, we mean any positive change—no victory is too small.  We're aiming to populate this space with stories that beam out hope to those who need it most. And we’re pairing these stories with groundbreaking web design to ensure each story is as captivating as it is hopeful.  I know projects like this often come with their own agendas, but we’re staying true to the heart of each narrative. We want these stories to be authentically yours.  We're starting small but dreaming big, hoping to grow this into a vibrant community where you can find stories that resonate with your own experiences and challenges.  If you've experienced a positive shift in your life that could light up someone else’s path, or know someone whose story could spark hope, I’d love to hear from you. We’re planning to launch soon and would be thrilled to feature your story.  Can’t wait to connect with you and share in your journey. Much love and looking forward to your comments or DM's!

1c6ar6w;Success story ;Loveandcoldbrew;I started treatments about a year ago after like, maybe 10 antidepressants failed. Over the fall/winter, I stopped going regularly because I was so busy and I felt better. This wasn't recommended by my provider, I really just didn't feel like going. I noticed this month my depression symptoms knocking on the door, and quickly realized that I had neglected myself. I'm back to weekly treatments to get myself to a good place again. It took a long time for me to feel better, and differences were subtle. I would say by 8 months I knew for sure that this medication had changed my life. I felt joy for the first time in years- and I cried hysterically- because it had been so long since I felt that feeling- I'd forgotten it existed. Little history on me: anxiety/depression started when I was 19-ish, I'm 32 now. Survived childhood home/food insecurity, sexual abuse, and was the child of a father who was severely addicted to drugs and a mother who had psychiatric illnesses that caused her to create alternate realities and delusions. By gods Grace I never fell into substance abuse, and I currently don't drink or do any type of street drugs. I leased my own home while still in high-school because I was blessed to work for an employer who knew my situation. He gave me the hours I needed to be able to feel myself and pay bills. I never had state assistance because I didn't know it was an option. Currently I own 2 homes, am in a healthy marriage with 3 children, and have an extremely successful career. Why am I telling you this? Because I don't look like someone who has depression. I look like someone most people want to be. And I want to do whatever I can to break the stigma around mental health disease.

1c5xfqk;I’m not sure what I’m doing anymore. ;romilove33;To be perfectly honest I don’t know why I’m writing this because everything is feeling a little pointless at the moment but I’ll continue on. Truthfully, I’m just feeling really stuck and off at the moment. I don’t know what decisions to make and I think that’s partially why I’m getting hit so hard by a depressive episode. I’m currently being screwed by my job, pay isn’t great but when the hours are good it’s alright. I have barely enough hours to pay my student loans at the moment. I have a timeline with what I want to do but I also feel like if I follow it I’m stuck with barely any hours and less than ideal working conditions, Another thing is my friend brought up the idea of me getting a phd. I personally don’t think I’m qualified enough to do it, but they seem to disagree. Even if I did apply, not that I’m sure I’d want to, I would have to move away from everything and everyone I’ve ever known to a different state. My friend who suggested this would be there, but I would still be leaving everyone else.  And then I fear I wouldn’t find a job with a doctorate in the same way I didn’t find a job with my first degree.  The thing is I’m intrigued by the prospect. I want change. But I’m afraid of it. One thing holding me back, is the fact that I made a new friend and I feel like if I leave her at any point our friendship isn’t secure and won’t survive.  I know eventually we’re separating anyway as she’ll be getting a different job soonish, but if I’m still in the same state I feel like it’ll be easy for us to remain friends. As well as I fear if I leave my other good friend bad things will happen. She’s already turbulent as it is. Without a friend near by I don’t know what would happen. I just feel like I’m constantly making the wrong decisions. I’m stuck. It’s making me sad and it’s bothering me that no one around me has seemed to noticed. I even told my good friend I’m sad, of course I minimized it because why take anything seriously, but I figure when you ask to talk about the mood you’re in and they say yes and then proceed to ignore you, it’s enough to feel like you’re alone. Anyway, I’m sorry for my rant, just curious what advice this community would have for me.

1c5qbs7;Suicidal for too long;Nie_-;It all started when I was 15. I dont know where it came from but suddenly (literally in 1 day) I felt really depressed and i thought people were ignoring me,… I just suddenly shut down and isolated myself from all of my friends from school. I had alot of friends and I was loved by everyone but suddenly 1 day it switched. Then I got deeper and deeper into depression and i couldnt seem to get out of it, it just kept getting worse and worse. In that time I still skated everyday and sailed every weekend. I also came head to head with suicide twice with my suicide note in hand, but then i fell down and cried and didnt do it. I couldnt tell anyone, i was ashamed and affraid. This really heavy depressive episode where i just felt trapped in my emotions lasted for about 5 months with ups and downs. It is just weird i was happy the other moment and really sad the other moment. Most of the time I was depressed. After summer break I picked up all my courage and to go to my friends and just stand and talk with them again. They all accepted me back, they said they thought i was ignoring them. I told them nothing about that i was depressed. The following 3 months everything was back to normal until i got the same feeling as last time and got depressed but this time it is alot harder. Last week i came back and faced with suicide and a note in my hand the same thing happened and i just broke down. Suddenly i dont feel like skateboarding anymore which is my passion. I used to skate everyday and even sometimes wake up at 5am to skate before school because i had dreams of being sponsored by my skateshop. I was finally getting good and i was in my prime but now i dont feel like it but i still want to i just cant to lift my body to do anything. Recently my sailing partner stopped and i also dont sail anymore. Wich was my second passion, we were doing europian championship, national championship,… Now its all gone. I used to play oboe everyday now i cant get my body to do it. Im affraid im going to kill myself. I want to talk to people about my problems but i just cant. I think everyone hates me, i hate the anxiety. I hate that everyone thinks that im ignoring them. I hate that i list all my passions. And i hate it that i can be happy but suddenly i am depressed. This depression is literally going to kill me. And o want help but i cant because im affraid of emotional connections.

1c5nwgi;Tips for Maintaining Routine?;Kooky-Salamander-549;"I'm a college student and I work part time. My mom passed about 3 years ago and I mistakenly didn't focus on healing from it and processing the grief before college (I was 17 at the time and I was scared of the idea of not starting school), so needless to say it has been rough the past few years in college working, tackling a rigorous course load, general growing up and ""adulting"",  and also healing from the immense loss I faced. I'm on the premed track in school and the workload can induce imposter syndrome, increase isolation due to how much studying it requires, and it generally can be very overwhelming even for someone who doesn't struggle with mental illness.  I'm in therapy now which has been really beneficial, but I still struggle with staying in bed and sleeping when I feel overwhelmed/depressed which ends up making me feel worse. I was wondering if anyone has any tips for sticking to a routine? More specifically how to overcome the sense of paralysis and get moving even when you don't feel motivated.

Cause I honestly see no point in working the whole day and then come home sleep and go next day repeat for the foreseeable future. And then? Die... I feel like then why not die today? Also as a hyper sensitive person, a regular day is already exhausting enough, that too working? Every fucking thing seems to overwhelm me. There's also currently no-one in my life that understands me or to whom I can relate (except for the being human part).

1c4hbpg;Why am I so young but I feel like my chapter is just about over.;Yxkozai;"I'm a young kid, l'm a sophomore going into my junior year in a few months and it feels like l've wasted the first two years l've even got to highschool. I personally ""peaked"" in middle school which is sad to say, i had everything ive ever wanted and had happiness I couldn't even comprehend holding today. I feel like I've lost it all and my personal spark to wonder what life would feel like if I stayed here another year (which I feel like l'd waste away until I get to my senior year.) I know I'm still a kid and I should just focus on the good times life is blessing me with but I just feel like there's this part of me that's saying I should go now, like my time is up. I've lost everything and I don't know where to go since I say one day it'll get better but those days have now turned into years; 3 years. Throughout those three years, I've thought about the same things, why can't I have the love I was oncesurrounded with, why do people now see me differently and no longer find interest in me, and why can't l become happy when life gives me the option to grow? I wonder how useless life is considering your name won't even be mentioned years after I pass. People would be sad, but l'd feel like I'm accomplishing what l've thought was right, but I don't want a permanent solution to a temporary problem but death doesn't seem to be a burden anymore. I'm talking all around in this writing but I can't even seem to think straight to express how I wanna die, like it already feels meaningless to confess it since it's been on my mind so often that it almost seems convenient.I just wish I had my spark again, my friends again, the love from my family and peers but it all left me faster than I could even get to high school. I feel as if my life has no more storyline to it and my chapter is done, like l'm one of the short books in a library and wasn't gifted with more pages to my chapters.Maybe I'm just in a bad place with no motivation to climb out of a hole that l've gotten into, I know if I was back to a place where I felt like I fit in, I could recover and put this mess behind me.

1c4gli2;My identical twin brother is suffering and it’s so hard to see. ;DecentProject2947;Hey guys, I’m going to keep this sort and sweet. My brother was betrayed by an old friend of ours who is very nasty, the friend he got with his ex girlfriend after telling him he wouldn’t, my brother told him many times that it was not okay.  We went to Australia and he then decided to start making moves (coward).Anyway, my brother had a pretty heavy reaction to this, sent him some messages saying he is a bad guy etc and in turn tried to make other people dislike the ex friend. Which didn’t work so much. The ex friend on occasion followed him home threatening him. He also spat at him on nights out and also shouted from car windows. All pretty shit stuff to happen to someone.My brother cannot get over this betrayal and is still extremely angry and in pain! It has affected his mental health, relationships and ability to express himself confidently. It’s tough to see, especially because he is a fundamentally good person with lots to offer. I really want him to find this closure, realise this anger and move on! Btw I don’t think we can talk to the ex friend as he’s pretty immature and it’s still painting a false story about the whole ordeal. There’s heaps of little details etc but I don’t want to exhaust you. What can I do to help?! What can he do to move past it for good?! Please help I’m really concerned for his life. He honestly can’t enjoy it. 😞Any responses would be great! Thanks ❤️;Hey guys, I’m going to keep this sort and sweet.

1c47q3t;Advice from me;Umetno_opinjon;"Hello, im 20f here because i wanted to vent, ended up reading these stories and now i feel like i can help a little. I always felt suicidal, since i was 10 years old. My parents are very balkan, and did not take me seriously at all, it progressively got worse until at 15, i went to boarding school. My dorm was near my school and this was supposed to be a new beggining, since i didnt fit in well at my elementary. I blew this chance as hard as i could, from stealing, drugs, piercing myself, tattooing myself, running away from the dorms, smoking and drinking in the dorms, generally being a “troubled youth”. When i was 18, i had very minor auditory hallucinations due to weed and insomnia. I was not eating, not sleeping, not moving. I blamed my depression on my “dark past” and my family trauma, and used this excuse to justify doing shitty things to myself and others. Broke down one day, screamed to my mom in the phone that ill do it. She picked me up and i was in the ward for about a month. There i met so many troubled teens, that were addicted to making themselves worse. Sobered me up pretty fast. I started helping with cleaning the ward, helping the lunch ladies, doing dances in the tiny space that i had. I realised that noone was coming to save me, and that i was the one that was going to do it, because i am more than capable. Being happy is hard, but so is this miserable path of existing, just gotta choose your hard man.Tldr; start taking accountabilty, however that looks for you.

I ask because I’ve seen a lot of different therapists, I’ve lost count of them all at this point but it’s probably been something like 12-13 different therapists. The last few times have been nothing short of a terrible experience. I went to an IOP program where I had a therapist who was incredibly invalidating, and they would talk about what you told them in confidence in the group sessions. One of the more recent therapists I had tried to get me 5150’d after she saw a pocket knife on my desk in my webcam while we were on a call. She called the IOP and said she recommended they commit me to a residential treatment center. They only did not because they understood my situation better than her. I tried to find another individual therapist after her, she was okay but we just didn’t vibe at all and I found myself dreading every appointment. I haven’t been able to find a good fit for a therapist in years. It’s hard to find details about a therapist before talking to them as well, I think you have to try an appointment or two to know if they will be a good fit for you.

But I don't know if I'm having side effects from the new meds or if they just haven't kicked in yet and im just experiencing depression symptoms. I feel extremely disconnected from friends and family, this intense loneliness that is worse than I've ever felt before.

No dreams or ambitions because I have lost interest in lifeI grew up in not a very friendly environment. Parents used to fight every other day over something. Dad was always out with his friends drinking and smoking. About 4 years ago my parents seperated for about 8 months but not an official divorce, they got back but those 8 months scarred me for life. Me and my brother were living with our mom during that time so I had to act like a father to my younger sibling and take responsibilities and my academic performance deterioratedI was a good above average student,but the last 4 years of school really took a toll on me because of all the bullying I endured. When schools went online due to covid I completely isolated myself from everyone and lost every single bit of social skill I had. I somehow passed school, it's been 2 years and I still fucking despise it because of all the traumatic experienceNo interests, no planning I started giving entrance exams for colleges. I didn't even take a break after school my parents just forced me into college. I chose programming and now 2 years into college I realise that I fucking hate my major and now I am just dragging myself till I graduateCollege has taken a toll on me too, I spend half of my day in college and when I am home I have no energy left to do anything. I was into lifting but I found it hard to do along with college and my parents only wanted me to study 24/7 so they discouraged me from going to the gym and eventually I had to quit the gym. As of today I have lost all progress I made in the gym and now I hate looking at myself in the mirrorGym was my coping method. Other than that I used to play video games. Now that the gym was gone I could only rely on video games. However last year in December my graphics card died. Can't afford a new graphics card so the video games are gone tooNow all I do is drinking and smoking and I feel disgusted because that was the reason I hated my dad in the first place and now I have stooped so low in lifeI have tried making friends in college, gym or just going out but there is just something off which I can't explain. It's like I can't build relationships anymore I fail to make myself important in others' life. Everyone knows me but no one really cares about me. I get no calls, no messages, I am just rotting in my room all day. Home to college, college to home and days are just passing by and I am losing touch day by dayI can't focus anymore, I have exams from tomorrow and I haven't studied anything because my mind is full of these thoughts and alcohol and anxiety. I have to keep myself busy at all times to resist these thoughts but is it even healthy to keep yourself occupied 24/7 just to avoid your thoughts and panic attacksI have no one to talk to, I feel extremely lonely and despite my numerous attempts I can't fit in with people of my age group. I am just watching others enjoy, go out, make progress, lose their virginity etc. I don't like to call my life miserable because there are people who probably have it even worse so it makes me feel like I am being a bitch ranting about my small problems so I am just bottling up I don't know where my life is going.

1c3qa8i;Antidepressants;Alehooops;Hi thereI wanted to ask, is it possible to ever stop needing to take antidepressants?I have been taking distinct antidepressants over the past 5 years. Some worked great, like sertraline, others didn't sit well on me, like bupropion. My psychiatrist recently decided it was right to change to a better one after sertraline. First I tried Venlafaxine and it wasn't working as expected so now I'm currently trying with Nortriptyline. This past readjustment brought me back to intense episodes of depression, and crying every day and I have been working hard on the practice of therapy I have learned over the past years.   I have a love-hate relationship with antidepressants. I recognize they have helped me greatly to recover from major depressive disorder, making life joyful for a long while. Yet, noticing how unstable my emotions and my mind can get when modifying this medication, has me wondering, and wishing, I didn't need it in the first place.  I know this may not be a helpful thought about my diagnosis and treatment, but I really can't help but wonder, is it possible to break free from antidepressants? Does it get better to the point where you can manage without medication? I am looking for examples of people who have grown out of their antidepressants.;Hi thereI wanted to ask, is it possible to ever stop needing to take antidepressants?I have been tak;REQUESTING ADVICE;2;1;2024-04-14 10:17:10;2024-04-14;Sunday;10:17:10;1270;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:42.228402
1c3pqgk;Can't get rid of guilt over staying in toxic relationship and can't stop thinking about it;spacesnowball;"TW: mentions of suicideTo give some insight to my current mindset, I am 23F and always struggled with my sexual orientation, going back and forth between thinking I was a lesbian with comphet and bi with an intense fear of men due to past trauma. I also am diagnosed with anxiety disorder, depression and ADHD.Around October I had a messy breakup with my then girlfriend where I was cheated on for the second time by her and very quickly after that met a guy online that, looking back on it, definitely love bombed me during a time where I was trying to find blame in myself for my ex's infedility and felt worthless. We had some online sexual activities (which I also feel immense guilt over as I am not sure about my attraction to men and feel that I somehow betrayed myself or my body). He soon became very oppressive, tried to put a curfew on me and control my clothing and who I would meet up with and had an obsession with me ""living and staying alive for him only"" when I expressed I was feeling suicidal lately. I don't think I ever did something without my consent but he would pressure me into sex by threatening to be upset and leave me when I didn't feel like it at all that day. We had about 5 breakups in a span of 2 months where I would feel relieved that he left but he would come back and tell me no one would be able to love me and make me feel valuable like he did and I would end up crying and begging for him to come back. I finally (hopefully) permanently got out of this situation with the help of my childhood best friend who cried and screamed at me to leave during a sleepover, during which he told me he would unalive himself and made me listen to the sounds of him fiddling with a gun. After all this I blocked him from everywhere, deleted any account he can find me with and I am going to change my number. My current problem is I cannot stop thinking about how I let myself be treated like this and tolerated such a bad person and even subjected my friend to having to forcefully pull me out of it and be that worried about my life and health. I feel ashamed about both the whole relationship and especially the sexual stuff, I cannot look my family in the face because of it. It has been a month and I cannot get rid of the weight in my chest, I am disgusted with myself as I tolerated stuff done to me that my values would never allow upon another human let alone a woman and it honestly is the biggest barrier in my healing process. What do I do? How do I get rid of it because I try reassure myself all the time and it doesn't seem to work. I also do not have access to therapy due to financial reasons atm.";TW: mentions of suicideTo give some insight to my current mindset, I am 23F and always struggled wit;REQUESTING ADVICE;1;1;2024-04-14 09:39:04;2024-04-14;Sunday;09:39:04;2641;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:42.230069

1c3klsp;Not my tragedy. Why won’t this pain go away? ;MamaTisTough;"I am not the type to read the news because I work in law enforcement and see & deal with terrible things daily. That said, I came across a video short on YouTube about the woman who left her 16 mo old in a pack & play for 10 days while she went on vacation. I looked up the news story like an idiot and I have been struggling mentally since. Bad. As a mother of a toddler, I just cannot accept that a mother would do this. The details in the news story I have not been able to stop thinking about for over a week. Just typing this here makes my throat feel knotted. I journal and have tried using mantras; “you don’t have to think about this right now”, “you can care but don’t carry it”, and even schedule time to overthink but this is debilitating. It’s on my mind nonstop. I feel like I’m crazy. When my son cries, I think of that baby and how she was crying and crying with no one to help her and start to feel panicky and anxious. I spoke to my husband about it and he thinks it’s odd that it’s affecting me so much. So do I. I did not know these people. I cry constantly and am just a mess inside. I even went and looked at my phone photos when this happened and thought to myself ‘while I was doing xyz, this baby was alone and starving to death.’ WTF.

But I'm struggling so constantly, hours every day, with thoughts of SH/SI.

So I am not on any medication currently.Has anyone come back around to the same medications years later and had a different more positive experience?Also, I want to ask my partner (m21) for more support.

1c3hokt;How do you look forward to things to get you through the day when you don’t want to be alive;Ok-Apricot979;How do you “find something to look forward to” when you don’t care about anything and don’t feel anything (emotionally). 26F. I’ve been told I would benefit from finding something to look forward to, to just take it one step at a time and try to live in the moment. I found a few things to do (tennis, running, and a social group that goes on outings together) after trying a bunch of other crap (choir, writing club, church, art groups, book club, knitting group). I go to these three activities but they aren’t enough to push me out of suicidal thoughts. I leave them and feel empty, nothing, and suicidal. I don’t feel like I’m a person. There’s nothing in my brain. People say when you’re in this state to just put one foot in front of the other. I realize I’ve been doing that for a few months now, my life is fine (full time employed, apartment, activities) but mentally I’m about the same. I’ve been active but I could end it all tonight and not care. I could do or not do these tasks and feel the same way. I’ve gone to two psychiatrists and nothing really happened with the meds, then I stopped going to the psychiatrist because of my lack of care in being alive.I guess I just struggle with feeling nothing, having nothing inside my head, feeling disconnected from my life, feeling totally alone, worthless, useless, boring, unintelligent, uninteresting. I know the final solution is to be useful to my community. I worked for a very service-oriented/scholarship school for high support autistic children and I was at one of my most suicidal times then (though I loved the kids and did everything for them. But I’d get home and just want to kill myself).Anyway. I don’t know what to do to help. How do I find interest in things. Everything seems really futile and I do just want to commit suicide. Only thing keeping me from it is my mom and brother. They are my reason to stay alive, but it’s turned me into a soulless, lifeless person who just does task after task to fill time.

This was the one thing I believed so deeply in earnest conviction until a year ago when I realized how absurd that was. Ever since, I have slowly been losing my mind bit by bit. For context, for the past 19 years of my life I have been the brother and caretaker for my autistic brother. My parents are nearing 60 and have no retirement saving because of my Dad's gambling habits (my parents are looking at a divorce). I knew this and my whole life was based on that premise. So I worked hard in school, and got into a really good school but I gave up so much in high school. Sports. Friends. Prom. I never got a chance to ask out my guy crush (turns out he was homophobic, but as a guy I like them spicy and with trauma anyhow). I got into the school I wanted. But this school is for smart people: I'm not smart, I just do what I'm supposed  I dread returning back home to be an autistic caretaker for the rest of my life. I have have no resentment for my brother. I only have grief for potentiality. And now that I am older now my chances are slim to finding a guy (am still in the closet) who will accept my brother. I will have to finance for my parents living separately. I will have to control my violent autistic brother and keep him from assaulting my mother. I have made fruitless contact with social services, the system has failed me. All of my high school friends have moved on and live their own lives. Friends are meant for spare contact for jovial fun, but I haven't a best friend who's meant to go through the rough and highs. All those candidates already have siblings who aren't autistic, and I it isn't right for me to impose kinship on them. I've tried many times. I've given serious contemplation to when my parents pass and I have fulfilled my filial duty, then and only then, to end the story. To close the book. Both of us. I certainly don't want to leave him to suffer the system. I've written multiple letters to him, pretending as though he could speak. And each and ever time, I'd think he want the same.

She also wants to be given everything, but she doesn't want to give anything.Sometimes I really want to tell her that she is a burden, that she creates all her problems for herself, and that perhaps it would be easier for everyone without her (it may seem to you that I am wrong, but it is.), that she has an alcohol addiction that needs to be treated But I'm too afraid that she'll do something to herself. (because she repeatedly told me that she didn't know what to do: open up or something else.) she wants nothing from life (except children, and her marriage is falling apart). She had the strength to admit that she was addicted, but not enough to go to the hospital. I am in a complete stupor from this situation and do not know how to help her (and whether it is worth doing it at all).

1c2fyw1;No will to live after 4 year relationship ended;Born-Extension-1895;We had been dating for 4 years. We were long-distance but made it work by visiting each other at least a few times a year. We kept our relationship a secret from our family since his family is Muslim and I didn't want my family to worry about me. The first two years he just could not stay loyal to me. He had a porn addiction, talked to other women, tried to get with other women despite being with me. Eventually, I caught him again and it was too much for me, I thought I fell out of love and I left him. I came back because I still loved or at least cared about him. My love for him grew back but I also developed intense anger issues. Around 1 year later, his addiction healed and he stopped pursuing women entirely. But even if something reminded me about his cheating problems again, I would blow up in anger towards him. I called him horrible things and made him slap himself. I thought it was justified because he cheated on me and when he would come over, he would hit me too.  Then the day of the solar eclipse I woke him up through facetime and we got into some stupid argument about organ donations. He got so pissed and he left me. He said he was miserable with me and wanted to work on himself. He told me he completely fell out of love with me. He said things to me like how he doesn't care if I was dead and the more he looks at me, the more hates me. But he also told me there was a small chance he would come back to me but he didn't want to be in any relationship anymore. This was so sudden to me it was nothing like him. He was really sweet and patient to me every day before this. We had been getting a little distant recently but I thought it was just college stress and distractions.   Later on a mutual friend texted me telling me about how he has been talking to another girl and he was already with her the day he left me. Since we kept our relationship a secret, he was basically my only closest friend and person in my life. My other friends were just classmates and I don't know them as well. I abandoned my hobbies and my life for him. I gave him everything I had. I know I treated him cruelly and that it's my fault I feel horrible. But without him I just don't want to live. My only motivation in life was to keep going so that I could get a stable job and fund our lives together.  I actually love him so much. I want to commit suicide but I don't want to disappoint my parents. I can't talk to my parents, I can barely talk to my friends. I have nobody and no will to live. It's been almost a week and it feels like it's been forever without him. He texts me once awhile just to tell me he can't respond to me on messages. That's the only thing he says to me. I don't know how I will keep going. I have completely lost motivation. I can barely eat one meal a day without throwing up and I have to force myself to drink water. My grades are dropping and I may be kicked out of my nursing program if I fail my finals. Every time I walk into my clinicals I think of using my patient's meds or tools to kill myself. I purposely walk into the bad part of the city or at night and hope something or someone kills me. I have given it time and it hasn't gotten better, just worse. All I can think about is him.

My reason was always that I was tired and depressed. But the tiredness went away and I can be happy. The problem persists. Want to skip and little to no care for it. I had my life set out infront of me ready to work towards my career. It's possible still if I pick myself up but I look inside myself to find the want or the motivation and I come back empty handed. I realised I have little to no resolve, which in my personal morals I consider to be weak willed. I always considered myself a strong person who meant well and had drive, and I find myself the opposite of who I thought I was. It's hard to recognize you're nothing like what you wanted to be, even being those people who you consider to be lackluster. I don't know how to pick myself back up. Time just seems to March on without change. I've put myself in a loop that I'm stuck in by my own doing. There's a settling feeling of finality of my disappointment in myself. I don't know what to do. I can't get up and do things. I'm well versed in depression and I don't know if that's what's happening, but I know that even in my positive period's I can't bring myself to do anything. Time is ticking and the deadline of full failure gets closer every day. If you've experienced the same, or know something about this feeling of finality/situation please leave a comment. Greatly appreciated <3;Hi. I've recently had to have the realisation that I've failed myself.

The DPDR doesn’t go away and then come back, I legit haven’t felt real SINCE I first smoked weed. So many years have passed me by without being able to actually live through them.

I just wanna feel real and live. My mother doesn’t understand, nor does she show that she cares. She says I’m being dramatic. I’ve never been able to see myself living past 25 years old  I wanna die. I don’t want to keep living in this heavy half dried concrete of a headspace. I really wanna die. I just don’t wanna experience the pain of continuing to go through this, or spending most of my life in this shell like state. I can ACT normal, but I feel so empty. I feel like my soul is gone.

1c21opy;where did my excitement go? university has drained my soul;Kitchen-Chain-4758;"mostly a rant, sorry for being text heavy :/i've been feeling pretty hopeless and upset for quite some time now. I (f20) am in my third year of university in western Canada, and it's been terrible. Ive had a miserable time trying to meet people have an enjoyable experience. I feel like i've failed at university, and it makes me so sad that I'm not having the same university experience my peers are. I have no passions, interests, goals for the future, or any excitement for life really. I cant see myself in any long term relationships, i have no dream jobs or anything I can look forward too. All i know is that I hate my job, my school, and my life. I just keep thinking, ""is this really what life is?"" Ive only made one real friend at uni (my first year dorm roommate who i still live with), and I met my partner of 1 year at a job a couple years ago. I feel pretty disinterested in my relationship and am debating ending it, but i don't want to lose one of my two friends. I feel like i've given university a good attempt, i've been to 3 different schools, 4 different uni programs, and 4 different jobs trying to find somewhere I feel like I fit in. Ive tried clubs and social events, but it's never worked, or I just don't enjoy myself. I see my high school peers and mutuals meeting new people, making friends, doing super fun activities, and I really feel like i'm doing something wrong, or maybe somethings wrong with me. (i know social media is just a highlight reel, but they at least have highlights, i've got nothing). I'm so tired of university, I hate my classes, and Ive found nothing that interests me (i've taken courses in almost every single discipline offered). i have no motivation to learn and feels pointless b/c i'm not working towards any career goals. but dropping out would leave my family, and myself, disappointed, as I somehow still do well in school. Anyways, Im feeling very disheartened, lonely, and dreadful of the future. I'm hoping to find that I'm not alone, and that someone on here feels less alone too. I don't know what to do to get my excitement for life back. I so badly want to be happy, to enjoy my life, and have something to look forward too. i've never posted on reddit before, but writing this has made me feel slightly better. well,  if you made it this far, thanks for reading :)";mostly a rant, sorry for being text heavy :/i've been feeling pretty hopeless and upset for quite so;REQUESTING SUPPORT;3;2;2024-04-12 05:58:48;2024-04-12;Friday;05:58:48;2334;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:42.309579

1c1yuzm;Concerned about my bf + out of ideas;BookstoreLust;I moved from another state to live with my bf almost 2 years ago. I brought 2 kids, he has one. His is almost a teenager now. Mine are younger. We are both in our 30s. We have had ups and downs and he is really struggling. He has addictive personality for sure, went through a lot of programs/counseling for over a year to overcome it before we got together. He lived with his parents and his lifestyle has always been easy for him until he lived in our place where he now has a decent job and has a lot more bills to pay. He also got two dogs. We have three kids together and his rock gym that he went to all the time closed down right before we moved in together. Here’s the issue. He has informed me that he has had a dream where he dreamt he was dead and when he woke up he was pissed that he had to wake up and go to work and do living stuff. He doesn’t want to do anything. All of a sudden spends over $60 on a game on his phone when we don’t have that extra, it’s needed for food and his sons birthday coming up and we don’t get paid again until 4 days from now and he is complaining we don’t have stuff he likes to eat and he doesn’t want to cook. He doesn’t like anything anymore. Says he doesn’t have hobbies and doesn’t want to find new ones or a new gym. He lost a lot of muscle he had gained from the rock climbing gym and his buddy and the food cost was more than we could afford. For just him it was $600 a month he calculated. We are behind on a lot of bills because of his spending. I try to get ahead but it’s difficult with him. He cancels plans with friends constantly who would be good for him. Also, I found out a lot of his friends growing up just used him and weren’t actually good friends and didn’t reciprocate the same relationship he thought it was. He would help, and help, and give but would receive little in return. So after so long he has given up. He doesn’t tell me things like he used to. He is in a bad mood all the time. Doesn’t want sex. Doesn’t shower. I remember recently I had to wash him up and I told him I would do that so that he would shower.  Doesn’t want to take care of himself or his stuff unless it will affect him negatively at work. He has thrown himself into his work and has taken one day off in over 4 weeks. Cancelled on our date night 5 minutes before we were suppose to be leaving. Kids with babysitter and everything. He says no one cares about what he wants. I have been doing everything around the house. With the kids, the dogs, etc. I’m afraid I’m going to loose him soon, not in the relationship but to himself. He thinks he will loose me, regardless of anything I say or do. I am in therapy myself, and even just twice a month it helps me. He refuses to see a therapist, doctor, a counselor, anything. If I tell his parents they are just going to lecture him. He doesn’t want anyone else to know any “personal” problems either. So I know if and when I do tell someone he is going to be so mad.

I've been on sertraline for half a year with almost no effect on depression (worked for anxiety tho, got way more talkative), so I have quit it and recently changed to venlafaxine (little over 1 month on 150 mg so far) . However I still feel so drained even when doing nothing, absolutely zero motivation and no energy whatsoever. I can barely force myself to get out of bed to make food. My whole body feels numb and heavy. I used to play a lot of pc games in the past, but for last few months even that doesn't bring any kind of joy. I just lay in bed and look in ceiling with blank stare for whole days. I feel so dead inside. I know I'm gonna commit suicide, it's just a question when. I can't keep going like that for much longer. Do you guys think that I should raise that venlafaxine dosage?  Or I should rather go and do all kind of blood tests to rule out other diseases? Can anyone visit me and kick me in the butt to motivate me somehow?

1c1gcwr;41F, seeking tips for stopping negative self talk;Beneficial_Nail4945;"I've never posted on reddit before. I've struggled with depression for many years... I'd say maybe 5-7 years diagnosed and medicated. Though medication was helpful for spiraling, I have not been able to kick the negative self talk. My thoughts consistently swerve back to negative things about myself. I hate this for many reasons 1) self absorbed- depression feels so self involved sometimes... 2) I haven't been able to break the cycle so far. I have the most success with distraction. 3) trying to ""rewire"" often feels artificial and fake to me. Maybe its worth continuing either way.I can't seem to stop thinking about how I'm a waste of space or a waste of a life... a loser who hasn't accomplished anything, how I've let myself down and those I love, how it's too late for me to change things in a meaningful way. It hurts so much to think things like this about yourself and I know it infects everything about myself. I am so scared my depression will bleed over and impact my daughters even though I try to let my attitude towards them be independent of these feelings. I was wondering if anyone has real life tips (not diagnosis) for stopping spiraling thoughts or having a new outlook. Is there anything you tried that worked in your life?for years I think I've had this idiotic fantasy that I would somehow be rescued and loved - but I'm married, I have kids, I have a lot to be grateful for in many ways - I hate that I am like this and I know it has to be me that fixes things- no excuses.

Over the last three days, each day, one of my close friends has blocked me, leaving me feeling confused and hurt.First, one friend blocked me because I couldn't respond immediately while I was busy. I regret not getting back to them sooner, but blocking seems extreme, right?Then, another friend who I've been chatting with for four months suddenly revealed they weren't interested in talking anymore. It took me by surprise and left me questioning our entire friendship.Lastly, the friend who seemed the closest, always checking up on me and vice versa, unexpectedly blocked me after I confided in them about the other two situations. I thought we were on the same wavelength, but now I'm left wondering if they were chatting and I inadvertently offended them.I'm struggling to understand what I did wrong or if there's something going on behind the scenes. We had such a solid connection, similar interests, lived close by, and yet, it feels like the friendship just vanished into thin air.So, Reddit, how do you cope with something like this? How do you move on from feeling betrayed and abandoned by those you trusted the most? Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

So, I spoke to a therapist about how to do it the right way while also preserving your own mental health. The blog post goes into full details, but in short, here’s their advice:- Be aware: Pay attention to subtle shifts that might indicate that they’re struggling, like withdrawing from activities they love or engaging less in conversations.- Be supportive: Gently encourage them to seek professional guidance, if necessary, while also offering practical help with day-to-day tasks to make their load lighter.- Be kind and patient: Treat them with compassion and understanding. Everyone's path through depression is personal and requires time.I also know that asking for help can be hard — especially if you don’t even know what to ask for. Hopefully this makes it a little easier; try sending it to whoever you’re leaning on to help them understand.Best of luck friends.

But now it's reversed and I ask him to please not get with her (even though I know I don't have a right anymore) but I was begging him to not get with her and not have her in his life because I hope that one day, when distance makes the heart grow fonder and he would return to me. But when I ask him if he is going to get with her. It's now turned to, I don't know. She's a good person. She's really fun to be around and she's the only person I've got right now.

1c05ny9;The medical community has failed me. ;deviltalk;"-On the Friday before Easter, my (now former) Psychiatrist took me off an SSRI (Pristiq) cold turkey. For weeks leading up to this I had been complaining about bruxism. The pain eventually became intense and I sent him a message on MyChart which he responded by telling me to stop taking it. While not an expert, I had heard of withdrawal and anti depresents so I confirmed with him- ""stop taking it completely?"" to which he confirmed. By Sunday I was in the throws of full blown withdrawal. Worth mentioning I was on vacation. -On Tuesday I was still a wreck and had entered the most intense state of depression I'd ever been. I was unable to go to work. I tried to go to work Wednesday and Thursday. But was forced to leave early both days. I missed work Friday and have been home ever since. -During this period I sent messages to my (now former) psychiatrist, my primary care provider, I walked into a mental health clinic, and I made an appointment with Zoomcare to get FMLA because my PCP couldn't get to me soon enough -The psychiatrist offered to put me back on a lower dose of the med. I told him this was too little too late. The worst of the WDs were over and I didn't want to reintroduce the drug to my body or cause the bruxism to return.-I asked my PCP to please put me on a new antidepressant. He did but it's very low dose. And to please refer me to a new psychiatrist as the last one lost my trust and caused me harm. I've been getting the runaround for a week now and still waiting for this referral. -Zoomcare took two appointments and $375 out of pocket and I'm still waiting for FMLA docs. During the first appointment I was told that I could ""always go to the emergency room"".Conclusion: I'm not suicidal, but dark thoughts have crossed my mind. The amount of time I've spent calling one provider and arguing with people just to get care with people who are supposed to advocate for me would have surely lead me to end it if I were. Our system is failing when it comes to mental health. I wish I would have taken more detailed notes of this process, because it's been a circus, and it's ongoing. I hope I'm in the minority when it comes to this sort of thing, and if I'm not then we need to shine a light on it because it's absolutely pathetic.";-On the Friday before Easter, my (now former) Psychiatrist took me off an SSRI (Pristiq) cold turkey;REQUESTING SUPPORT;0;1;2024-04-09 22:43:49;2024-04-09;Tuesday;22:43:49;2266;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-19 13:28:54.950388

1c033p2;My cat is going to die alone and it's all my fault and I just want to die;Anxious-Coconut-2784;"29F. I've struggled basically my entire life with depression, self-harm, and eating disorders. Now that I'm an adult, I thought I had everything under control. But I was wrong; I'm self-harming again, and I can feel that my eating disorder is coming back. What triggered all of this? Here is the answer...Until a couple of months ago, I was living in my country with my boyfriend and my cat. Last year, I was super bored with my job; I hated my boss and too many of my colleagues. I was feeling depressed again, lying in bed all day and doing nothing useful in my free time. One day, I snapped and told myself that enough was enough. So I decided to look for a new job and, why not, to move abroad, because it was one of my dreams... When I was the right age to do that, there was Covid, and I didn't want to move abroad away from my family because I was so scared...So, I found a job abroad. Great. Super happy. I signed the new contract, quit my old job, and as soon as I did that, my cat became ill.Now, I want you to understand that my cat is basically like a daughter to me. So, obviously, the plan was to find a house in the new country and, after that, take my cat with me.Before going abroad, I took her to the vet; she underwent many exams, but the vet doesn't know yet what exactly is wrong with my cat. The vet thinks it might be cancer, so in the next few weeks, she will probably undergo a CT scan or something similar to clarify the situation...Now I'm alone in a hotel room while she is sick and probably wondering why I abandoned her!?! I can't stop thinking that if it's really cancer, she might die alone while I'm here ""living my dream""!?! Because of course, no one will let her fly if she is sick... So, I can't be with her ever again.I know I have been selfish in deciding to take this job. But my boyfriend was super supportive... and when I signed the damn contract, my little cat was okay... I wouldn't have done all that if I knew she was sick. Every time I think about this, I feel like I cannot breathe. I can't stop feeling guilty, and I can't stop crying. I miss her as if I'm missing a part of my own body, and I just want to hold her...I wish I was sick, and not her. I wish I had never moved.I don't even know why I'm writing all of this here... I probably needed to let this out of my system??If you made that far, thanks for spending time reading about my stupid life...";29F.

1bztr4f;Mind is racing ;Ambitious-Pipe2441;I woke up earlier than usual. My bladder was full and I heard the cat meowing his long, frustrated hum. I pretended to ignore him and tried to get back to sleep. But I couldn’t. So I got up, groggily went to the bathroom and came back to bed hoping I could just go back so sleep. But it was too late. I am awake now. And I noticed something happening. My mind started throwing all kinds of thoughts at me. I reached for my phone, but something told me to wait, see what happens. So I pulled my hand back and let the thoughts flow. And flow they did. Moments from my memory like a “memories” photo feed just slideshowing a random collection of images. Then I slipped into an old thought habit of fantasizing conversations. At one point I was having a conversation with an imaginary homeless person. Then I had thoughts about deep disappointment. It always felt like I disappointed my Mother, and now my wife is struggling with her discomfort in my depression and it kinda reminds me of those old wounds. Disappointment.  My heart feels heavy. I want to reach for my phone so bad. My mind starts slowing down a little and I look over at the clock. An hour has passed already. It felt like 20 minutes, but I’m shocked and give a small chuckle. An hour gone just from letting my mind run wild. Now that it feels a little less intense inside I allow myself to pick up my phone and instead of scrolling through Reddit, I decide to journal. Write down my experience to maybe process a little, organize my thoughts, but also share a piece of my experiences with depression in hopes that someone out there may find some comfort. Everyday I try to do one thing. If there’s nothing else I can manage, at least do that one thing. What’s today’s thing? Not sure yet. But an hour and a half since I woke up and I’m feeling tired, but a little less wound up. Like the spring uncoiled and that’s a decent start. Maybe today’s one thing is to resist temptations to fall into the same habits and routines that I use to soothe my scrambled brains. Hold off just a little on jumping into denial and allowing myself some space to exist. I’m allowed to take up some space here. I can be more present and less detached. Just a little at a time. Keep the faith. Protect that little flame inside you today.;I woke up earlier than usual.

I have good days but usually something triggers me and I'll spiral down to rock bottom.Long-term relationship (10 years) ended two years ago, and everything prior had been set up to help my partner move forward with her career. We moved to a new town, away from my family/friends, where I got a new job that I didn't really want in the first place. She changed her mind and left, telling me she was miserable her and with her choices. A year later a friends telling me he thought he hears she got engaged. Now I'm stuck in a town away from everyone without the choice to go back.I moved on with my life, felt dead on the inside, but I moved on. Actually went from bottom of the totem pole at new job to asst manager in a year.

They all like me, but I don't like myself.Trying to put myself out there with dating, not being rejected but things keep phasing out even after putting the work in. This undoubtedly kicks in feelings of self-hate due to what happened with my ex, making me afraid to even try anymore.

1bzjgrp;Which antidepressants have worked for you in actually helping shift the fog?;friendlyforestgoblin;Y'all, the big sad has got me in such a chokehold lately. I'm always a little bit depressed as a baseline, and always have been, and these big big sad periods come and go. But I just feel so foggy and clouded by it.It's not about anything in particular, though there are factors. My job is draining, my chronic illnesses are absolute dogshit (i have multiple connective tissue disorders and spinal problems, and i'm in pain all the time). I get that those are factors. In spite of those things, I think I do well to try my best. I get out of the house (i work from home) every day and try to do something enjoyable, i go to therapy when i need to talk things out, I do my hydrotherapy for exercise and try to get good pain relief (medical cannabis has been life changing for pain relief), i keep my pmdd under control by suppressing my periods. There are things in my life that are satisfying and fulfilling. It's not all contextually or situationally bad.It's just this gloomy, foggy, cloudy hopelessness that numbs me constantly that i desperately want to feel rid of. It stops me from doing things i want to do and am trying to do, because i just feel like i'm being suffocated by a blanket that i can't shake off.

1bzi771;small depression tip ◡̈ ;Much-Eye4776;It seems simple — but simple is what we need in times when finding the energy to survive is difficult. This alone is a task, but if you can find one form of media (podcast, an audiobook, YouTube, TikTok) that can keep your attention, save that exclusively for when you’re doing a mundane task that is difficult. For me, I struggle with b/p cycles at night, so brushing my teeth was always the toughest. Since I’ve found one book that I’ll only listen to while I’m doing dental tasks, it’s made it a thing to look forward to, and if not, the dopamine hit from having that thing to go to will hopefully help the day wind down with healthy habits. It doesn’t always work, but of course it’s still better if it works once or twice after trying it, than none at all. Progress isn’t linear nor is it always a predictable pattern. It’s a part of the healing cycle/journey, and we try and accept it as a part of that process.;It seems simple — but simple is what we need in times when finding the energy to survive is difficul;PROVIDING SUPPORT;0;1;2024-04-09 03:28:24;2024-04-09;Tuesday;03:28:24;917;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:43.864566

I escaped workplace that gradually become toxic and didn't have any personal growth opportunities for me in the first place. Plus, I was paid too little to survive alone and I plan to move out from my parents as soon as possible. When I quit I planned to take a few weeks off and search for a job in a field I wanted, then my mom told me I will have no growth in there too, plus I'm not suited for tge job, so i dropped it, cuz i need the job that pays enough to live and requires minimal or none experience. I decided to switch to another job niche, almost stepping into scam company and eventually I found a job and... Bailed. It wasn't too hard, i could've get used to it, but I didn't like it.

My parents of course still love him but there's definitely a loss of glint in my mother's eyes when he is the subject. lam about to finish my sophomore year and I have straight A's except for one B in my freshman year. I played high school soccer my freshman year and wrestled for half of my sophomore year. The only reason I did wrestling is because my father wanted me to; he often placed second in national wrestling tournaments, and saw potential with me. I was really good for the short amount of time that I had been training and it seemed to be the only thing that my dad and I had together. It made him so proud so l endured the grueling practices and unethical amount of work placed upon the wrestlers. He was so happy. He told his parents about me and how proud he was. While wrestling, I started to develop a condition in my knees, which caused immense pain. Combined with the stress of academics and the pain in my knees, I decided to quit wrestling. My father was understanding, but was very disappointed to the point he looked like he was gonna cry. The guilt from it never grows lighter... While on the subject of guilt, there is another thing has been eating away at me. At around age 7 one one of our cats had recently had a litter of kittens. I was playing with one of the kittens while they were sleeping and blood started coming out of its mouth. I was scared and in a panic blamed my younger brother, saying that he got scared because the cat was scratching his head and threw it at the wall which led to the kittens unalivement.I will never know if the kitten was alive before I even entered the room. This is something that l've been harboring within me for a matter of eight years. I do not deserve to be forgiven. I feel extremely guilty for what l have done to my brother. I placed the guilt of something very serious on him and he did not deserve this. After I recently realized the severity of my situation, the weight on my shoulders grew. It led me to try drugs.

1byp53b;I feel like I should make more friends irl but Im too anxious and don’t want to.;Flimsy-Sale-4704;Context: Two or three years ago I met my current online friend group, We video call almost everyday and I love them to bits and they genuinely make me so happy. But at the same time I tend to say things without thinking and some may come out as insensitive or hurtful. It is never my intention to say anything like that but truly I start to overthink a bunch of things. Also if you’re wonder yes I do have a friend in real life that I’ve known every since we were kids. She currently moved to a different city and a different high school but we still keep in touch. Even with that I don’t conversant with anyone in my class nor in the school. Which then makes me worry if something ever happened to my friend group or if my friend in real life ever stopped being friends with me I would have no one else. I’m always overwhelmed with this thought everytime Im upset or even just trying to fall asleep. But here’s where my anxiety kicks in, When I talk to people I don’t know I tend to sound very sweet. But on the inside my heart drops and all I can think about is if I look ugly or if my voice sounds nervous. It always comes up and you know how your teacher puts you in groups? Yeah most of time I have to force myself to communicate just so I can get it over with. But even though yes I feel like I should make more friends in real life I also truly don’t want to because of how people act nowadays. I tend to judge quickly based on how people act to determine if I want to be friends with them or not. But all the kids at my school always skip class, say slurs, even do substances in the bathroom. Even with high security at my school and having to only carry clear bags and everything they still find a way. I know I can meet others my age outside of school but with how the world is i rather stay indoors. But even everyone else in my friend group online has their other friends. But it’s just me, I mean Im fine with them being my only friends but I can’t help but feel sad and overthink it. What should I do in this situation?Edit: When I said I tend to say hurtful things I mean more so me and my friend group like to joke around but in my eyes im always worrying if what I said was too mean that I ruined the joke;Context: Two or three years ago I met my current online friend group, We video call almost everyday ;REQUESTING ADVICE;2;1;2024-04-08 04:38:43;2024-04-08;Monday;04:38:43;2222;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:43.918683

I've been to therapists but never found a good fit, and can't afford $100 a week to keep trying. I've been on and off meds but don't currently have a doctor, so I don't even know how to go about starting them again. Or if they would help.What gets to me the worst lately is seeing other people live their lives. I'm not trying to compare, I'm truly not. But I don't know how else to feel when someone shares what they cooked for dinner tonight, and it hits me that I'm not even capable of doing that. I cook a massive pot of something 1-2 times per week and eat the same room temperature leftovers for every meal. I can't even  function well enough to plan, go to the grocery store, or cook, so it's either that or takeout every day. Or someone mentions in passing that they're hanging out with a friend after work. I can't do anything but pass out on the couch after work, because the act of just getting up and leaving the house is impossible enough for one day. I don't go on vacations or trips not because I can't afford it, but because the energy I'd need to just plan it is so unattainable for me. I want to plant a garden in my yard this year, but when I think about the research I'll have to do first I nearly have a panic attack. If I do laundry or cook on one of my days off, that's the ONLY thing I can do that day. I can't even relax and read a book because that one simple, stupid task that is a part of everyone else's daily life has sucked away all my brain space and energy.I want to be able to do these things. I want to experience new activities and go new places. I think my depression would be way better if I could just do some of these things some of the time.

1bymmtg;I want to end it so bad ;kevy-wevy;I don’t feel like I have the right to feel depressed after looking through some of the other posts. I admit that I have it handy my parents leave me to do what I want, I have friends In school and I’m not bullied. But I still feel like walking into the bathroom and ending myself with a knife, or finding some sort of chemical in the house and just downing it. When I put my head on my pillow at night all I think about is wanting to end it. I imagine myself putting a gun to the side of my head and pulling the trigger even though I live in a country where guns are illegal. I do have a knife and I do cut myself. It makes the thoughts of wanting to kill myself go away for a little while because I know hat it would feel like to actually do it. But I t’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever done in my life because now I have scars on my forearm and I can’t wear short sleeved T-shirts, this is going to sound rich I know but I’m going on holiday with my school for three days to a hot country, and I have clear scars on my forearm. What the fuck am I meant to do about it. My mom saw the scars once on a hot day because I was laying in bed with a T-shirt on and she saw them. She asked what they were obviously alarmed and I lied and told her it happened in school playing football or rugby and the reason why they look fresh is because I’m picking the scabs. She dismissed it and continued on and nothing more was said. I’m glad and upset at it, I’m glad she didn’t make a big fuss about it and didn’t look any further into it. But I’m upset because as my mother she saw long uniform cuts and scars on my forearm and didn’t bother to look much further into it. Tomorrow im going to have a shit day and I know it. I’m in transition year in school and every Monday I go to work experience and i got work experience in a mechanic shop. I thought it would be good because it’s the type of stuff I want to do when I’m older, for the first term I was in a carpentry shop and I enjoyed it. When my mom dropped me off to the mechanic shop the owner was laughing and saying there’s loads of work for him, I’ll keep him busy and stuff like that, but when we went into the shop he showed me around and went to talk to his friend. I was standing in the middle of the shop awkwardly when the receptionist walked out and handed me a brush. I swept from nine o clock to half four in the afternoon. I wouldn’t mind if there was a lot to brush but there isn’t. It’s not a big mechanic shop and I had the place sparkling at eleven I clock. I have to cycle out down a dangerous road tomorrow for another long shit day. I have never been closer to walking into the bathroom and ending myself I just can’t do these long shit days anymore.

1bykes1;Is it more than depression?;VerisnHunter;I (F19) have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized and social anxiety. However, lately I’m starting to feel like there’s something else. That what I’m feeling can’t just be depression. I feel like I’m going crazy. Like one day I’ll be super down and feel like ending my life and engaging in self harm and then like 30 minutes later I’ll be having fun watching tiktoks or singing and dancing around my room. It doesn’t make any sense to me and it feels like I’m going crazy, my thoughts and wants aren’t consistent anymore. I’ve made a great group of friends at college who I adore, and sometimes when I’m with them I’m having so much fun, and other times I wish I could be anywhere else even though I love them. And I am also trying to start experimenting with dating and it’s like one day I have a super huge crush on a guy and want to  be with him and experience romantic attraction, and the next I tell myself it’s selfish to like him because of my condition or that I never even liked him and I’m just lonely. I don’t understand my thoughts anymore.I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t know how to cope with this anymore. There’s a history of depression and bipolar disorder in my family. I know I have depression but am wondering if I am possibly bipolar. I’m planning on making an appointment with my psychiatrist soon, I would just like some insight on what to do.;I (F19) have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized and social anxiety.

1byi72r;I don’t feel like a good person ;Original-Apricot-107;I guess I’m looking for advice. I have a full time job and do freelance work but lately I have no motivation. I have a routine of speed walking every morning and get plenty of physical activity but still eat too much. I can’t bring myself to do basic adult things (paying bills, cleaning) but will impulsively spend money. It’s now affecting my spouse as he has had to bail me out too many times. I spend money and eat to feel okay for a bit. I perceive every change in my partner’s behavior as him considering leaving me. I just zone out for hours half the days of the week. Then I have good days - but overall my life is an absolute mess. I am in like $100,000+ of stupid debt. I can’t see my therapist anymore unless I make payments and can’t bring myself to part with the money so I can spend it on fast food and clothes to fit the body I hate. I am so bored with life. My husband is patient with me but I know he no longer finds me attractive and we’ve been married less than a year. I am a terrible partner and just a leech on our relationship who cries when I don’t get enough attention. I have been this way in some relative context since I can remember. I’m on Wellbutrin and have given every antidepressant in the book a real try. I’m self sabotaging my life for no reason but I feel like half the time I’m stuck in a disassociative state. I used to have terrible OCD and spent most of my childhood on high alert for my parents emotions because my mom was bi polar. I feel like my brain is just fried when it comes to caring about things. Like I spent it all as a child. That’s a bullshit excuse but i can’t seem to turn my brain on anymore.

1byewov;I went from rock bottom to the happiest and kindest I've ever been.;waldeinsamkeide;"Since the age of eight, I've struggled with severe depression, severe paranoia, severe self-harm, mild psychosis, and antisocialness, I'm 14 now. For six years I've been in a never-ending cycle of depression, nihilism, paranoia, and religious trauma. I've starved myself, denying myself from sleep for days, never bathed, never left my room, cut until my cuts had cuts, ran away, attempted suicide two times in one year, and even more.Yet, now as I'm typing this, I'm the happiest I've ever been in a long time. Yes, I still have some issues to work out, but generally? I'm shining, I'm relaxed, I'm at peace, something last year me would've seen as foreign. I recently went to my therapist this month, and she told me that I had changed for the better. I was bubbly, talkative, energetic, and calm, a massive improvement from last year. And it's true. I feel better, I look better, and I act better.People tell me that I'm the kindest person they've ever met. That I'm compassionate and sweet, and loving, and a light of joy. And I am. Truly!And this is something I heard in a book, but kind people aren't born. They're made. They've experienced rock bottom, and know how it feels to live in an empty nihilistic, suffocating, depressive void, and they've made it their life mission to never let anyone in their lives feel the same way they had.I'm saying all of this because it IS possible. I know most of you must be tired of hearing that, but that's because it's true. Things will get better. But it's up to you to take the first step. You have to be the one to make the trajectory in your life. You have to be the one to say, ""I will not let this break me. I can get better. Things will get better.' And eventually, they will, as long as you have that mindset, and determine yourself to be selfless, kind, loving, compassionate, and all around the best person you can be. Have hope! And if anyone needs or wants to talk to me, my DMs are fully open! Stay strong! Stay positive!";Since the age of eight, I've struggled with severe depression, severe paranoia, severe self-harm, mi;PROVIDING SUPPORT;8;13;2024-04-07 20:46:11;2024-04-07;Sunday;20:46:11;1981;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:43.944922

1bycwpi;Public Breakdowns;TMVenture;I’ve been battling this horrific illness on and off for a lot of my life, but for the last decade it has been pretty consistent. At the moment it all feels like pretty much a losing battle. The cycle of hoping things will get better and then the inevitable crash of being unable to function again has taken its toll and is getting old really fast. I’ve recently been having much shorter periods of functioning vs total incapacity to do most things. The last year especially (probably longer) I would say every time I’ve felt well enough to do anything social or attempt to do work and act “normally” it’s immediately followed by total inability to function for days or weeks and a meltdown. And even more recently that breakdown is starting before I’m done with the activity. I have been like this before but not this badly for a long time and I never knew how to deal with it then. I’m currently returning from seeing some friends for a day and am already having a hard time, crying on the way home infront of everyone around me. I know I’m ill but I do find this part super hard and embarrassing as I usually hide the worst parts of my depression from everyone. (Even admitting this in this post is super difficult for me). I don’t want to stop at least trying to function and push myself when I have energy but I would like to find ways to cope when I’m having a public breakdown. I would like to know firstly, that I’m not the only one that this happens to, and secondly what you guys do to manage these sorts of breakdowns/comedowns, especially in public. So far I’ve decided to start bringing sunglasses and maybe handkerchiefs with me when travelling so that I can at least feel some control and privacy when I have a crying fit around strangers. Any other suggestions would be gratefully appreciated.

1byci5v;I feel like therapy isn’t working anymore.;NeonSpaceGhost;I’ve been doing therapy for a few years now. I feel like I initially tried a couple different therapists and things just didn’t click. Then I finally found one that seemed to work, at least for a little while. We were able to work through a few things but then that just became stale and she recommended I work with someone else.I started working with my latest therapist and felt like things worked really well and we were able to cover a lot of things. But now I can’t help but feel like it’s just not working anymore. It feels like our recent sessions are okay but like it’s just superficial. Like the conversations are good but it’s all just basic shit like “how was your week” and “here’s some basic topical recommendations like setting boundaries”.At this point it just feels like generic help anyone could get from reading crap online, and like the real issue is being ignored or glossed over…like we never actually explore the deeper issues or what’s really causing all this. I mean, shit, I don’t even know what the deeper issues are. I feel like I’m just depressed and angry and drowning and I don’t know why. Initially he said it was a midlife crisis, but that’s all been resolved and those feelings of sadness and anger are still there, so I don’t think it’s that. The problem is it feels like those waves of sadness, anxiety and frustration just keep getting worse.Sometimes he’ll ask questions or say things that make me wonder if he even wants to continue as my therapist…like “do I want to keep doing therapy” or “how long do I want to continue therapy”. I feel like the superficial discussions and some of those little comments make it seem like he doesn’t see anything wrong with me…like am I just making this all up? Am I just trying to seek attention and validation? I feel like if I’m being honest that that’s not the case. I’d honestly rather just disappear. I’d honestly rather just not exist. Maybe there isn’t anything wrong with me? I don’t know. The problem is I feel like my mind is just so fucked up and confused I don’t even know what is real anymore.I just don’t know what to do or where to turn. At this point I feel like I’m just starting to lose all confidence in therapy. Not only that but I just feel exhausted, like I don’t know how much longer I can continue doing something like that. People will say “just find a new therapist” but that process is so fuckin draining. Like you find another stranger that you’re supposed to open up to about your deepest feelings. Like I don’t even talk to my wife and friends about that kind of shit. And I just don’t feel like I have the energy or patience to go through the process of building trust and that relationship all over again. I can see why people just completely withdraw and give up on life. Is that’s what’s left? Is that the next step?

Or simply even just care enough to not be in dirty, smelly clothes or to wash my face. I want so badly to be clean and look healthy even if I’m not but even when I promise myself I’ll start taking care of myself, I fail immediately. Any easy ways I can get myself used do that routine like spray on moisturizer or lotion you put on in the shower. Just stuff that makes taking care of yourself more easier when you have no motivation. Thank you. Edit- hi please real advice and not stuff like “sleep more” and “get sunlight”. Please ways to manage lack of motivation with depression instead of propaganda about how you can “let go of depression” by sleeping and exercising. I’m looking more for actual tips you guys use that makes brushing your teeth and showering not feel like a chore. Not imaginary ways to “cure depression”. Sorry if that sounds rude or mean;Hello!

Mainly because I’m in the process of working it out. And so how can I really expect the therapist to assist me. While I recognise that therapy can serve many roles. I’ve always been seeking it out to help me with very specific anxieties that I’ve had trouble confronting. Things around socialising etc. but time and again I’ve found that therapists have sought to box in my idea into their own framework rather than aiming to hear what my issue is. I’m afraid it’s probably me. I can be unclear in verbally explaining myself and get tongue tied. Now to be honest, I feel quite adamant that quitting therapy was the right thing to do. So I am not asking if I should go back to therapy. I might be not right away. What I am wondering is this. Could my depressive thinking be impacting my ability to express the troubles of my condition in therapy?And if it is impacting my ability to express my challenges, how can I get help for my condition. By this I simply mean, depression tends to dull everything. I’ve been living in it so long, it’s pervasive. And it’s only when I’m around other people that I can get excited or at least see them get excited. Notice contrast. Not just dull, anxiety, dull.;I am running into a problem that I’m hoping for some insight into.

1by09kq;Shitstorm continues;Trauma-Comedian-4043;For a while, I could handle the shit life was throwing at me. Now, I just dont have it in me to continue. Idk if its just the crazy emotions right now and looking at what I have to do to survive, but I am tired and feel like I cant. I have a superpower of compartmentalizing and pushing onward but its not helping anymore. I am out of luck and cant find a way to make it anymore.I got out of a low-key abusive relationship in December. I cant even explain to ppl it was abusive because they wont believe it due to my ex being a class a charmer, theyll blame me bc my ex made sure i was always the at fault person and people can see that being more plausible, or itll ruin the career of my ex and theyll still blame me for that. Moved on and feel that is the best choice still. They took my friends since they were theres first. Ok, Ill make new ones, but I have been sincerely alone without anyone to talk to about my current problems and struggles. I am dealing alone and thats hard. And this is coming from someone who does fine alone. I cant turn to my family cause they are also abusive in their own way. Have been dealing with constant harassment at work and finally reached a point where I quit. Good decision, but also hard decision. I have run out of savings and with two job interviews this coming week, I still dont feel good enough and stable. I dont have money for food let alone rent for May. Sure unemployment, but thats around 250 a week and I have to wait three weeks+ for payment. I am nervous and feel like a failure. Not that money determines value, but when you cant pay for anything and have bills coming, it does take its toll. And lets be serious, having the foundations of life helps you think you are valued. Idk what to do. I am stuck with emotions, fear, anxiety. I cant figure out how to get myself out of this because these are huge problems. Theres no clear answer or path and on top of that im alone where it makes my problems seem even greater than one person. I am scared. I dont feel like i can get past anything but need to. Where do i start? I cant even start fixing one thing because it involves all the others. I am so fucked its not even a rock bottom story anymore.

1bxlasw;My mother is a narcissist and it's killing me...;Sab_x06;"I'm 18, but Asian, so I can't move out unless I literally get married, I've applied for university JUST to escape her, she's made my life such a mess and I am not spoilt or anything like that, but her whole self has made me hate everything about her and it's really sad because in Islam your mothers are really important.. I really don't know what to do anymore, I've always been disadvantaged because my father got into some debt when I was a kid and then in 2019, 2 days before my 13th birthday my dad passed away, he was my best friend, he was my life, literally. But the thing is, his death didn't make my mum like this, she's always been like this, it's like a dual personality because she's just so lovely to EVERYONE, other than me, even my brother, he stays asleep all day and never comes back from university too, but anything I do that he does, I always get yelled at by her, she hits me for the most basic and ridiculous things and it's honestly so so draining. I've attempted to kill myself many many times and Alhumdulillah I've failed because ultimately I do wanna live, just not with her.. it's sad because I'm not a misbehaved person or anything like that she's just made me wanna die, I started self harming because of her it's been about 5 years or so now and most of the time I feel so numb and depressed, my dad was my world I miss him so much. Everytime we argue (every day) it's either about money or because she won't admit she's wrong and I never can successfully get into her brain without her telling me to shut the fuck up and ""give me your phone"" she threatens me so much with every thing she can think of and it's so draining, she sad she doesn't know why my bro doesn't tell her about his life at university, about why he never comes back on time and things like that and then when I talk about my future, my life she says I'm talking too much or shut the fuck up again. Every single day I try and explain and she shuts me down, she's a control freak and an emotional abuser. I am so drained but I can't actually kill myself because I practice Islam passionately. I'm just so drained, at one point she actually made me wanna leave islam when I was like 12 before I realised it was her that was the problem not Islam, I would quietly tell her that her hair is showing but she wouldn't care it looked like and she would then at home yell at me for hours that I have now started to dissociate when she yells at me because of the trauma and scream at me about how my shoulder is showing and she doesn't say anything, how I don't wear the hijab properly (my neck gets uncovered when I'm helping my grandma bring in heavy flour sacks and just moving around lots in general) and it's just so sickening and spiralling and depressing and just ugh, Everytime I ask for help she confronts me aggressively saying how am I depressed and how am I anxious and I'm on my phone too much. Secretly I've started using diazepam when I have anxiety attacks because it's seriously getting that bad and I just feel so so so numb and dead. Little does she know that her actions and behaviour towards me has had me hooked onto pills (codeine co codamol) at one point which I've been clean from for a couple of months now, Alhumdulilah but I'm just defeated and drained and I've came to a point in my life where I feel like I hate her and I don't want to.";I'm 18, but Asian, so I can't move out unless I literally get married, I've applied for university J;REQUESTING ADVICE;2;2;2024-04-06 20:25:33;2024-04-06;Saturday;20:25:33;3359;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:45.243903

An year ago I went out as well. When I was about to leave in a few days.At midnight, she had attacks of vertigo.Couldn't even go to washroom or open her eyes.No medicine worked. We went to a number of neurologists and ENT especialists but everything was normal except for spondylitis which she has had for over a decade.Their medications didn't work and periodically she still had those acute vertigo attacks.Finnaly we consulted a psychologist and her medicines seem to work.My mother said that she couldn't do the house work alone anymore as she could fall ill anytime.So she has hired a full time maid to help her through. She has lost hope of getting well now.She was well for a few months until my sister left the house (after vacations), and her medicines course finished on the same data and the maid went to her house for 2 days on the same day. She again suffered from those vertigo attacksShe says that she'll keep taking the medicines now until she gets mentally retarted or dies. She seems to be a lot more afraid in life now.She spends her time with the maid only. I don't think she's attached to her but rather she is afraid of letting her go or else she will get vertigo again. My father also doesn't have anyone to talk to in my home.The atmosphere in my home is so dull and dangerous pls help me fix itWhenever I try to explain her she looks in no mood to understand and just nods blindly.Pls pls suggest me to how to help her outI can't see her this wayAlso we bought a new puppy so that she keeps herself engaged.

Sorry in advance.To preface I'm disabled (can't work), I can't drive, I can't go out, I can't maintain friendships nor do I want to, I'm a nervous wreck in public and I really only have my hobbies, therapy and hyperfixations to look forward to. All of these things are due to my horrific, crumbling mental health but I've always been like this for as long as I can remember. Officially I have about five diagnosed mental disorders and I'm also neurodivergent.Recently I've been neck deep in depression and I feel incredibly helpless. Aside from daily responsibilities like cleaning and maintaining my apartment (which I've also been putting off recently lmao) I haven't been doing anything productive to keep my mood from plummeting. I've been stuck in bed all day and all night just sleeping and escaping into my dreams where I'm much happier and living a fulfilling life unlike in my waking one. Even though I sleep and sleep and sleep I still barely have any energy to preform basic self care– I'm showering every four to five days and that drains all my energy in one go.To make matters worse I'm really fucking unhealthily attached to a fictional character right now and it makes me ten times more depressed to think about them recently because they're not real! I hate it. I hate being this pathetic. I've even cried over it a couple times. Almost started crying while typing this. It's so damn cringey.I'm still going to therapy every so often but I don't have much to talk about during appointments anymore. I tried reaching out to a close friend (the only close friend I have) but I don't want to burden them with my situation and I know that they're also going through their own battles and I don't want to make shit worse for them or strain our relationship.So...? What do I do? Do I just accept that I'm a giant fucking loser and my future is going downhill fast? Because that's basically what I've done at this point. I hate being a pessimist because it makes things worse but how do I look on the bright side anymore? I've been looking into homeless shelters and how to survive when you're homeless because I've been expecting the worst. I've also been researching assisted living and nursing homes in my area just in case. Idk.

1bxg7ly;My husband passed and….;Zoeyjaine;My (44f) husband (45m) passed away on March 25th, I am still in disbelief. He truly was my very best friend. We’ve known each other since we were 16-17. He was my second husband, and we were married for 6 years, together for 11. Now, my ex husband (34m) is seeing me in a vulnerable position, and has decided that he would deny me access to my daughter (12f). He was has had her since March 27th. We have an agreed upon schedule that we have always followed, and maybe tweaked here and there to accommodate plans or whatever. Our court order is 50/50, and there is no set schedule.  It is simply supposed to be as agreed. Because of what has recently happened concerning my husband and him see his opportunity, my ex husband has decided with no agreement from me, to follow the recommendation of the county and follow their spring break schedule for parent visitation. It states that he gets her from 6pm Friday the 29th of March until April 7th at 6pm. During this time he has slowly been driving her and I apart with less and less communication each day. Last night I was checking up on one of her social media accounts and making sure she was “being good” because last week she was caught being talked to sexually by a boy and she was ok with it and didn’t end the convo. Anyways, as I was reading a couple messages kinda skimming around, I read one that says her dad told her that I accidentally murdered her step dad. I DID NOT! She also was telling this friend that she was told that I need to “live in a rehab house with 5 other people and that they would give me food and water and therapy”. I do not do drugs, drink, or anything that would cause me to be out of sobriety. As far as therapy, hell yeah I could use that, so could she. Nothing wrong with that. So, throughout this last week I have called, the police, CPS, FoC, even the governor’s office, along with any other agencies I thought could help. I’ve gotten no where. FoCsays to file a complaint, which I did. He now has 3 weeks to respond. 3 weeks…. I was told that I need to file an ex parte order. I have no idea how and a lawyer? Hahaha who has money for that? Aside from the fact that I’ve lost my husband, and at this time, my daughter, I think I’m doing ok. I cry and feel sad, then I get angry, then back to sad. But I am holding it together for the most part. My husband was not only my very best friend, he was my caregiver because I have CHF among other things. I’ve lost so much…. I miss hm terribly! What can I do? How can I get my daughter back if I can’t even begin to afford a lawyer? I need her and I believe she needs me.;My (44f) husband (45m) passed away on March 25th, I am still in disbelief.

I'm almost 30, living with my parents and on welfare with little to no prospects, so about as indesirable as they come as a man and any prospects for making a living are such longshots that I can't wait for or count on them. Either way my health is shit too, I know getting old is normal but I feel like I aged about 50 years over the last ten, and now I get headaches at the drop of a dime and am constantly tired. I don't know what to do anymore because I've tried countless meds and treatment options over the last 5-6 years and at this point I don't know what could possibly help anymore when nothing will solve the burned-out dumpster fire that is my life.

1bxbg53;May divorcing my husband help alleviate my depression? ;Adventurous-Car-2250;I've been married for almost 10 years now , have had 6 pregnancies , and blessed with a beautiful 5 year old boy. Since I moved to Australia, I cry a lot at nights. It started with my grandpa succumbing to cancer in the first year of my move. After my son was born, I kept crying and thinking of death. We have moved houses for 3 times and I can recall crying in bed trying to hide my tears from my husband in each one of them, but he never really knew.  Until one day when they had to keep me in the hospital to validate that I had depression and my husband was there with me. They were asking me questions about my feelings for the last however long period.  As soon as he heard me talking about the attempt of cutting  my veins, he rushed out of the room crying. He's been very caring but we have never really had anything in common except for our values. His fun is different to mine, our paths have evolved to be even more different now, that I don't really want to go to the parties he goes to. The only thing keeping me alive are my parents abroad. Otherwise, here I am - a waste of human body on this earth just hanging there thinking maybe it's my life purpose that I have to find yet ? Maybe it's because I am with the wrong person I am not able to find my path ?

When I go to sleep I just want to be there forever, the only reason I get up out of bed anymore is because of work, and that's because I HAVE to I work in customer service so I have to fake a smile and a customer service voice all day, but in-between jobs I'm driving in a car by myself, with nothing but music and my thoughts. My thoughts in the car are telling me I'm worthless, that I don't deserve to exist let alone be happy. Telling me that if I was gone everyone would be better off, but I know if I died it would make people sad, so I'd rather just disappear. I've been trying to get outlets and I've been trying to find things to distract myself from these thoughts. But nothing is working anymore, my meds aren't working anymore and they're making it so fucking hard for me to eat that I've been losing weight so I feel weak, and it just makes me feel worse because I used to be strong. My ex keeps telling me I can reach out to her, but what am I supposed to say?? 'Hey since we broke up I've been feeling like I don't want to exist anymore' It's not because we broke up, but it certainly didn't help the feelings I was already having. But if you tell someone that they're just going to blame themselves. So NO I don't feel like I can reach out to her. I keep telling myself I deserve this.

1bx7sy2;Purpose and Companionship;Fuuu-uuuuck;I feel like I can't find a purpose.I'm not suicidal and I don't even think my circumstances are inescapable. It feels like I just don't have a clear goal in mind for my life to pursue. I've always had been underweight with eating habits,  I can stay up for hours and just starve while not feeling hungry. I don't know what to do there at all.I'm in community college, but I don't know what I'd even want to pursue doing. I already took a year and a half of a break between high and college to figure shit out and I still have no idea what I wanna do. I'm sure I'm smart enough to do any subject I'd want given enough effort, I just can't push myself to stay disciplined. There's no passion with which to strive with. I always feel like I'm cutting corners in my work aswell. I know college isn't everything as well, but if any career I'd want it to be something from college, I regret taking the break before and I don't want an alternate path from that. I feel like I'm in a mall with loads of money, able to buy anything and nothing's catching my eye. As for companionship, I was in a relationship that ended months ago and I can't stop thinking about her. I was a bad boyfriend. I had a shit schedule with shit habits, I barely paid attention to anything in life at the time including her. She had plans with her life and hated how I acted but saw what I could be, the person I was at the start of the relationship. I kept saying I'd change and I get better and I hurt her and she left me. I got no closure, no means of contact, nothing. And I deserved every bit of that. I haven't tried to reach out since the breakup because I know it's what she wishes.And that should stand as an example of how my condition is affecting me and the people around me. I pushed away someone I cared about. I hurt someone I loved. And after the breakup I gave it a shove to change, I improved marginally, but I can feel the train running out of steam. To make my mental worse, I think she's found someone else. That part shouldn't affect me, it isn't my life and I should hope she is happy. I do. But it also makes me feel inadequate for being hung up on her, though she was a great person so it's only natural. I've tried multiple anti-depressants and I'm gonna be starting another one soon, maybe it'll do something.I'm writing this at 2am, I have work tomorrow, and I don't think I'll go in.

1bx16yq;I want to feel better!;Jolly_Manufacturer94;Since I was 12 years old, I feel like I have consistently been living in a state of depression that I just can’t seem to shake. It’s not been consistent over these 4 years but it is always there, even if I can’t feel it in the moment.I don’t like myself that much as a person. I’m not beautiful. I don’t apply my skills well. I’m not particularly kind to people. I anger too easily. I think it’s deeper than that because I think I am a deeply ugly person in a lot of different ways that I can’t even describe. I sometimes just FEEL as if I am a different species than the other people around me. I FEEL way too much in general. I can’t help it. I think I’m losing it.My life has been so miserable lately that I’ve just been absorbing myself in media, or my own made up universes in my head. I dislike school. I always compare myself to others, who are so beautiful, and kind, and smart and well liked. It must be easy to be a good person when everyone loves you. I try my best but I feel like I have a negative aura that makes people keep their distance.I’ve tried so much. Self care, making schedules. Sometimes it works and I went through an extended period of happiness. Then it comes back.For the first time, last year, I thought I cured myself. I was not depressed and I was not happy. I was normal. I was unhappy, as most people are normally I assume. It was bad. I was unhappy but I didn’t have the comfort of depression. It made me think that maybe life is just like that- mundane, consistent misery.Is that true? Sometimes I see others and wish I could be consistently ok and sometimes happy like they are. Is that not real? Is not being depressed just consistent unhappy.I would rather be depressed. Atleast then I feel like it means something. I have a goal to KMS. I have a direction to go in. I have my plan for when I turn 18. Now I have nothing.I do honestly feel, with logical reasoning, that everyone I know would be better off if I died. I am unlikeable I know. I am not nice to look at. My only value is my creativity but I will never be able to apply myself enough. I am idiotic.I am desperate. Please don’t judge me. Do you have any sound advice, not just short term like meditation or  better sleep. I’ve tried. I want something effective. I am making an effort to stop this.;Since I was 12 years old, I feel like I have consistently been living in a state of depression that ;REQUESTING SUPPORT;4;3;2024-04-06 03:08:21;2024-04-06;Saturday;03:08:21;2297;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:45.263453
1bwzzo4;Idk what to do anymore ;No_Pay_5356;I (21nb) am going through the roughest bout of depression to date. I was clinically depressed at 7 due to t1 diabetes, i was depressed at 13 with a binge ed, again at 17-19 with a restrictive ed and again now but this time it’s like never before. I’ve been sick for the last year and it’s drained me mentally and physically to the point of doing any sort of activity/social event/work thing for more than 2 hours takes it out of me entirely and I don’t want to do anything with the rest of my day, nor do I have the energy or capacity to do it. I feel like I’ve been living on a tank that’s been empty for fucking years and the doctors won’t do anything to help me whatsoever. I can’t start antidepressants due to waiting for an ADHD assessment so I’m effectively left in the dark to deal with everything on my own with no assistance whatsoever (I know it’s a very repetitive cycle of sounding like poor me in regards to medical incompetence and a list of medical excuses but these are only a few of such a long list that it’s beyond the point of being excused from a medical perspective and I’ve had enough of letting it go). I’m scrabbling desperately to find SOMETHING that sparks joy or makes me feel alive for more than a few hours because even when I do it feels like the world just crashes around me as soon as I’m left to my own thoughts and when I’m by myself it’s completely unbearable. I’m going to bed crying every single night and sleeping as much as possible to a) combat the exhaustion and b) so I can participate in as little of the day as possible. I’m so lost with wtf I’m supposed to do and who else to ask for help- every therapist I’ve ever had (and believe me, there’s been a LOT) has either straight up told me they don’t know how to help or simply can’t be bothered anymore and the others have only been allocated to me for a max of 6 sessions /6hours from the NHS and I’m not in a financial position where I can afford to pay for one myself right now. Every medical professional has either ignored me completely or thinks it’s not bad enough to do anything and blames it on me being sick but still refuses to help me get better. I’m too tired to keep going on like this and I don’t know how much longer I can push and push with no positive outcomes and no idea of where I’m pushing to be or what I’m pushing for, and I’m struggling to find any reasons to validate what I’m supposedly doing it for. It’s fucking exhausting and I’m so lost and angry and confused as to what I’m trying for anymore.

1bwhmmi;I think yesterday I felt a bit suicidal for the first time in my life. ;EasyKaleidoscope6436;The NSFW flair is there because I mention suicide and SH a couple times, but it’s mostly a rant I’ll probably delete when I feel more lucid later. Sorry for the long post. My partner of three years with whom I was VERY close disappeared on January 10th - I have some attachment issues and was irrationally scared he’d eventually ghost me but never really believed it fr, it finally happened.He lives in a different country, so I don’t know what happened. Been trying everything, found nothing. When I feel at my worst, I just think he’s dead.Yesterday I talked with an old friend for a while about the past, and I don’t know, perhaps it was the memories or the fact it was such a sunny day and it reminded me of last spring, when we used to be so happy… I don’t really know. I’ve rarely felt this bad, and for some reason, when I started playing a game to think about something else and a random user started insulting me for no reason, it kinda was the last straw. I’m a gamer, I’m used to toxicity, but yeah, yesterday was different I guess.I do self harm sometimes, and I feel sad every day. I recognise the feeling. Yet I think what I felt yesterday was kind of another level. Perhaps I’m wrong and I was just very, very sad and in a bad mood, but well, it was a kind of “darkness” I am not accustomed to yet. This dude and I had literally made plans for when we’d be sixty. For a while in my life, I dared to think I had found something to be really, completely happy about, despite all the inevitable hardships a couple has to face. I won’t ever find him, I’ll never know what happened, and people will keep being awful just because they can, and if I defend myself, I’m obviously the bad guy for talking back.I won’t ever kill myself, there’s people who love me and obviously don’t deserve this shit... and normally I’m not this desperate. It was just an awful irredeemable day, so I went to bed instead.;The NSFW flair is there because I mention suicide and SH a couple times, but it’s mostly a rant I’ll;RANT;2;5;2024-04-05 13:09:20;2024-04-05;Friday;13:09:20;1911;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:45.275675

I am turning 40 this year and it feels like every day of my life has been a fight. I’ve been fighting my whole life. Fighting as a child to protect my brother, to protect myself from abuse, being disbelieved. Fighting as an adult to protect my children from their abusive father, fighting to have the additional needs of two of my children recognised and supported. Fighting through 4 major depressive episodes when all I wanted to do was just not exist. Some days, I just don’t have the energy or will to keep fighting. I’m so tired of it all. I will never give up however. I lost the right to do that when I became a mother. I will never do anything to hurt myself because it would hurt them.

1bwcay2;Am I Depressed or Am I lazy?;True_Net_8718;Hi, I'm feeling stuck. After graduating from college, I decided to pursue a master's degree. However, during my gap year, I failed the entrance exam due to a lack of motivation. I struggled to study and instead found myself sleeping and playing online games to distract myself. Although I did study, I couldn't focus for long periods and felt unproductive. Following another gap year, I decided to work to become more active and productive while studying. During those five months, I experienced a significant amount of anxiety and found it unfulfilling. Every day felt like a struggle and I couldn't wait for the day to end. I eventually quit my job before my entrance exams and managed to score good marks. However, I performed poorly in the college interviews and haven't applied to any other colleges since then. Despite being a studious person, I often find myself doubting my abilities to work or study due to a perceived lack of skills and knowledge. Regardless of whether I am working, studying, or doing nothing, I consistently feel anxious and disconnected from the world. I feel nothing but fear and anxiety.;Hi, I'm feeling stuck.

1bwaow1;Absolute Loneliness;Bolgacius02;21mI consider myself to be a person with greatly above average intelligence. I’ve had pretty much nothing all my life, and spent the vast majority of my childhood locked in my room with nothing to to but think. I escaped into fantastical worlds, and became incredibly passionate about all forms of art. In fact, I even intend to make movies some day that I truly believe have what it takes to reach audiences worldwide. I underwent some of the worst trauma imaginable throughout my childhood. I mean no exaggeration when I say this- the circumstances I suffered were the type that you would hear about spawning serial killers and the like. But in my propensity towards philosophical thinking, I’ve managed to tame my negative thoughts throughout the years. I understand what is necessary in most situations regarding emotional turmoil, and have centered a great deal of my adulthood around self-betterment. But for the first time, I have been confronted with my deepest wound that has remained suffocated by my other woes. As I’ve worked past my other pains, this wound seemed to tear open when I was most vulnerable.This is not a pain I can think my way out of. I am utterly lonely. I have never in my life known the love of a woman. Not from my mother or sister, not from a lover, not from anyone. I want to hold a woman and be held, and above all to be understood, but dating apps don’t seem to work for me, and I honestly have a fear of the outside. I was bullied all my life, and got used to being locked in a room, so of course I’m comofrtable indoors. And besides, there are things I want to do with my own time, I enjoy absorbing media that poses unique ideas for fantasy and writing, and drawing inspiration from them for my writing. I see no value in going outside, except that I might find any sort of love.I can and will never find love just sitting in my room all day, and my heart aches worse and worse every single day. Just tonight I went for a walk around my city in the incredibly slim hope that I might have an immense stroke of luck and find someone who could love me.All of my passion for art and desire for fame is being utterly drowned in the despairing sorrow of absolute loneliness. I feel truly hopeless, I can not find anyone. I dont think I can endure this loneliness any longer.The hardest part is lnowing that no matter how much I talk about it, I will start tomorrow feeling the same way.I genuinely feel like I’m dying.;21mI consider myself to be a person with greatly above average intelligence.

1bw5xht;How Can Anyone Work 40+ Hours A Week;a_mayfly;I (19f) have severe depression, meds barely keep me alive and I've tried everything that people say helps them (therapy, working out, diet changes). I've been debating on posting for a while and keep rewriting because idk how much information is acceptable to put in a post like this.But to summarize my problem: I can't hold even a part time job for more than three months. How are yall with depression able to hold a job, especially a full time one? A little more info: When I work I'm miserable because I hate working, when I don't work I'm miserable because I feel like a disgusting leech. I don't have any college degree, I dropped out because I couldn't do any of the work without breaking down, and I have very limited experience because I can't hold a job.As a legal adult, it feels shitty to not be able to hold a part time job and to freak out at just the thought of full time. Plus, I haven't been working long enough to qualify for disability social security. Am I just a lost cause? I feel like I only have the choice of going to have to suck it up and bounce from job to job, working for three months, or give up on life completely.Thanks in advance.;I (19f) have severe depression, meds barely keep me alive and I've tried everything that people say ;REQUESTING ADVICE;10;12;2024-04-05 01:54:40;2024-04-05;Friday;01:54:40;1164;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:45.283869

I lost three years of school when we moved countries with my family. I am turning 21 next month and I all my old friends are halfway through college, and my new friends are starting college at 18. I can't shake off this feeling that I lost all my youth years and I can't take them back.My dad died a few months ago from a drug overdose and I'm the only one in my family that has a stable job, and I have to pay for everything now that he is gone (I work as a financial dominator). I wake up everyday to work, I work to live, I live to pay rent, I pay rent so we don't lose our house. I hate living like this, I feel so poor and tired all the timeEveryday I'm chasing my money wishing I didn't have to. I wish I was doing something else. I had so much potential as a kid, everyone would always tell me how smart I was, and I knew it too. I could do anything I set my mind to do, all my silly dreams ended up becoming just that, silly dreams. My whole life I told myself I wasn't gonna live like my parents did, and nothing was gonna keep me here. I was gonna see the world, go to college, go to parties and feel bad about normal things. I guess I didn't get very far before I ended up right where I said I wouldn't. I promised myself I would get out of this hole and I ended up driving myself deeper into it.Everyone is doing something but me. Everyday I wake up worried I won't get enough money for this month, I look at myself in the mirror and I am so defeated by everything. How did I get so bad? When did I become this person? I am so tired, if I could sit down and feel bad, if I had a place to feel bad about myself, then I would sit down and cry for hours but my siblings need me. My mom needs me. I can't stop working and I'm starting to cope by drinking or smoking. I just wish I didn't have to be hurt so bad when I was younger. Maybe I would've followed my silly dreams then. I wouldn't be writting this, nothing bad would be going on with my head. Instead I can't even cook, I can't even type properly because of how much of my integrity I lost this past few years.

Long story short I was friends with someone since child hood. 11 years old (I'm 26 now.) Her and I were inseparable. We tried dating at one point but agreed that we were better off as friends because dating felt weird. We were very close up until about 4 years ago, when she meet a guy and they got engaged blah blah blah. People get busy with life and I don't hold that against her. I'm engaged as well, and don't have much time. I invited her and her fiance to multiple events at our home, outings with friends, even just dinner, etc. They always had a reason they couldn't make it. I'm a firm believer in trying 4 or 5 times to be friends, but I just 100 percent give up after that. If I reach out and you don't put in any effort I let it and you go. I accepted that she wasn't a part of my life anymore a long time ago and basically never think about it.

But he really likes me and would think about things then get back to me (went from breakup to break).We briefly reconnected 2 weeks ago when he confirmed he was in the same place so this was a breakup for good. He said after some time he wants to be friends (seemed honest, not a cop out way of easing guilt).  I am having a very hard time with this. I know he has to focus on himself, depression is an all consuming monster. And I too am focusing on myself. But a big part of me is also hanging on and has strong feelings for him. If he had let me, I would have supported and not left his side. In most other breakups where issues have been clear incompatibility or no feelings, moving on has been clear.Here, I want some advice. Is there hope of us getting back together? I am aware he needs to work on himself first, he has made clear a relationship is too much. And I want to be friends, I care for this man and want to support him. But I also want to be in a romantic relationship. How do I navigate this?

1bvbion;Feeling like a failure and I just want to feel better ;Emstar35;I posted on here a few weeks ago and got some advice. I just can’t help but not feel like a failure. I have support through a program in my city that helps me a lot. But I don’t have any real support at home. I have been struggling for as long as I can remember. I left uni because I knew if I stayed I wouldn’t make it through. Everyone makes me feel terrible for leaving. Saying I wasted tons of money and a great opportunity. I stayed in bed for two years after leaving uni because I was so depressed. No one ever asked me if I was okay. I took it upon myself to seek help and started doing things to help myself.I had a job. I loved my job. Then my boss got in trouble and my job doesn’t exist anymore. My boss was willing to take a chance and hire me. No one else will even consider I interviewing me and I’m extremely limited because I don’t drive. I knew driving would be a problem and I’ve wanted to get my license for a long time. I tried getting my license when I was 16 but failed the test and my anxiety and lack of hope for my future stopped me from getting it for years. Now at 23 I took it upon myself to get my beginners. I thought everyone would be excited and proud of me. Instead they acted like it was ridiculous that I’d want to start driving now. My mom even told me she thought I failed the test on purpose when I was 16. That hurt. And now people have told me they would teach me to drive, but when I ask for lessons they come up with mountains of excuses not to. And now one will hire me so I can’t afford to pay for driving lessons.No matter how hard I try, I have no support at home and the support im receiving through my program only helps so much. I’m so tired all the time and sometimes I just wish I had support from the people I love. I don’t have any friends anymore and my family makes me feel like I should have left this world years ago.

(i'm 25f btw) which has made me very happy, but sometimes (a lot of the time) i can't help but feel so incredibly guilty that he's with someone who is seemingly always going through something depressing and/or stressful. i constantly have thoughts such as ""he'd be better off with someone else"" ""he probably secretly wants to leave me"" ""he doesn't actually care about me"" which i know, logically, none of those things are true. he hasn't done anything to make me believe those things at all and he treats me wonderfully. he's also very understanding of my mental illness. i feel so bad about having these thoughts, though ): i know that they stem from disliking myself and i am usually able to console myself, but sometimes i cry for hours because i form fake scenarios in my head where he leaves me, which i know is just my depression and anxiety working together.however, i'm also worried that these thoughts of mine (because i usually tell him when i'm upset over these things) might make him feel like he's not doing enough for me, which isn't true, and i don't want him to feel that way. i'm also really terrified of pushing him away and triggering a ""self-fulfilled prophecy"" type of event, which is actually one of the fake scenarios that i worry about that causes me to get upset. other than my bf, i experience these same thoughts, though to a lesser degree, with friends and family too.again, i know that logically, none of these intrusive thoughts/fake scenarios are true, and i try to handle it the best i can by distracting myself, but there are time where that doesn't cut it. does anyone have any tips or coping mechanisms you mind sharing, if anyone has ever found themselves in a similar situation?thanks for taking the time to read this if you did!

1bujm79;Idk I just want validation or someone to tell me I’m stupid;thesadguy3;I (14m) am just struggling in life with everything. My mom and dad always fought after they got married (so my whole life.) My dad took the anger of his unhealthy marriage out onto his kids. He hit me and it was always for the stupidest reasons like for me going downstairs to see my mom at night when he told me not to.My mom wasn’t much better either she never did anything to stop him other than just telling him not to.       About three or four years ago my mom and dad finally got divorced, and I feel like everything has gotten worse (maybe that’s just me losing my innocence but idk.) After my parents got divorced my mom took her two kids with her, and moved about 6 hours away from my dad which hurt a bit at the time. About one month after that I started middle school. 6th and 7th grade were ok except that I had a lot of fights with my mom.    My mom is one of those because I said so parents, and she gets mad at you just for having a different opinion than her. She doesn’t take me seriously because I was non verbal when I was younger. Soon enough 8th grade started which was hard for me from the start because the kids in my last class were really nice people. This combined with my anxiety, lots of homework, and me putting too much pressure on myself led me to just start staying home.   I have been just staying home and barely going outside for the past six months. Doing this makes me feel sad to because I am just wasting my life away. This has also led to many more arguments with my mom and her saying she should have hit me when I was younger. I don’t really talk to my friends much anymore due to my anxiety which has made me really sad.   Last Christmas my dad came up to see me which I was fine with at first but then we got into a heated argument which led to my brother tackling me (he’s usually a pretty nice person he just has some anger problems,) and my dad grabbing me by my shirt and choking me. He left after that but then he accused me of ruining Christmas.    I blocked him after that but my mom wants me to get back in touch with him because FaMiLY      The most recent thing that has started making me sad is that I recently converted into atheism but I can’t tell my mom about it because I am scared she would disown me. things that make me sad but I can’t write much about1.

1buihef;Is my boyfriend manipulating me?? Idk what to do. ;moochibrat;Me, 18F and my boyfriend, 18M have been together for about a year and a half. He’s always been a great guy and we had a healthy relationship. Things  changed when told him I am moving to a new country across the world for a year. A change in his behavior is understandable. But this behavior is so unlike him, and it’s not only me who noticed. My dad told me that I should prepare for him to lash out and be sad, but to watch him. My dad noticed that he’s different, even just short interactions. The behavior changes really started when I brought up that I think we shouldn’t do long distance. In the past, I have told him that I want to have a few more relationships and experiences before getting married, he wants to marry me. He’s my first relationship. Instead of getting uneasy when I mentioned that like he used to, he seemed almost excited and completely agreed with me. I found that strange. Since then, he has been using substances and working out a lot. This combination means he’s more powerful and also has an “excuse.” Lately he has been touching me even when my body language says no, and even if I push him away he continues to try. He doesn’t force himself on me fully, but I think I make it clear enough that he should have stopped. I usually have to raise my voice or get up and walk away. He has become more forceful in general, and more sexual. And before I continue, I want to make it clear that the things I like sexually are different from what I’m okay in real situations. I think that line is getting a little blurred lately. He is very rough with me, to the point where I need to ask to stop. He says things like, “I’m the only one that can make you feel this good,” and, “I own you.” I have liked when he is a top, but this is different, too much at times. He’s become possessive. When we have sex, it feels more angry and as if he’s trying to prove something instead of loving. He makes me feel small and he is unapologetic. I was going to dismiss all of this, but with my dad’s opinion and my gut feelings combined, I think there’s something not okay here. This is my first relationship so I’m not fully sure, and if it is manipulation/abuse, that can be confusing. He is also a lovebomber, but sometimes I can’t tell. Basically, he went from, feminist, funny, loving, and gentle, to angry, possessive, hurtful, and manipulative. Many people have informed me that there are times he actually assaulted me, those times are memories I think about often but before people told me I didn’t actually know. I’m wondering if he wasn’t aware that what he was doing was assault if I wasn’t? Is he still someone I should be weary of? Also, I’m wondering if this is a normal reaction of someone that loves you in this situation. Is he just sad, or does he feel like he needs to use me/be possessive because I’m leaving?;Me, 18F and my boyfriend, 18M have been together for about a year and a half.

1buhmz0;My breakthroughs.;F3el1ngEm0;Throughout my childhood I'd been stressed and depressed, not realizing it and never understanding why. getting to my young adult years I've started piecing it all together and making breakthroughs in understanding, but it seems only to make me feel more hopeless, like this problem is no easy fix.Breakthroughs, and conclusions I've come to about my cause of mental illness have all connected to the people in my life and the experiences in my childhood. Just recently I'd concluded my mother was a narcissist and it has caused me great emotional trauma, and I'm the only one in my family who sees it. I've even seen the way she's affected my older brother. How much he lets slide, how he is unspoken.Even with all my repressed anger toward her I still feel immense guilt for despising her, even a little. She's my mother after all, and I love her regardless. This conclusion has only dug me deeper into my depression knowing someone so close to me is one of the triggers.It's because of her that I have selective mutism, never able to speak out or stand up for myself. Why I get panic attacks when someone even slightly directs frustration toward me. She's caused me such emotional trauma. Yet I feel indebted to her for taking care of me during a period when I was sick for 2-4 years, I don't even know how long... and feel such guilt for being angry with her, the conflicted emotions are just too confusing.Ontop of this I've never had anyone in my life who took the time to know me and stayed. Not to say I'm a bad person, I don't know why no one's ever tried to connect with me.. Reasons why they didn't stay, however never had anything to do with me.That is to say I've never had emotional support. Never had anyone who understood my struggle... Still don't. Don't have anyone to confide in the fucked things I've discovered in my life.And I've never truly had a part in my family as anything other than the sweet youngest child, because no one ever gave me the chance to be more than that. They didn't want me to stray out of that role. If a tragedy occurred I'd be the only one in the house that didn't hear about it.I'm So Tired of being placed in a box of someone else's creation. Why the fuck does everyone still look and talk to me like I'm a child? I'm 20 YEARS OLD!Won't SOMEONE know me? Fucking someone please! I'm not a fucking child... and I'm not okay.

I just got home from work later than expected (had messaged and told her) when after 2 days of not sending me any messages she says she wants to talk before I go to sleep at which point she breaks up with me. It's currently 2:40 in the morning and I'm outside alone in the rain. Before I met her in December I'd been single for going on 8-9 years with one fling early in 2023.I've been okay but after being together with her I just can't be alone anymore. It terrifies me to the point I just want to curl up and cry for the rest of my life. I just don't know how to handle anything right now. She was the only thing I had that made me happy. My motivation to keep going at work. I just can't bring myself to go through the hell of trying meet someone again. I'd been speaking to one person before I met her and that turned out to be a romance scam. I lost near 10k because of that and had a hard time trusting my ex before I met her in person the first time.I just don't think I can ever trust anyone again.

It has always been my fault, whenever I try to argue she calls me stuff and makes me feel as if I am in the wrong always. This time around in my high school I worked hard to land an acceptance offer in a Top 20 university in the world to pursue econometrics and for the past so many weeks she has been forcing me not to pursue it even though I am on a scholarship there. She is calling me all sorts of things, she even went on to say that I paid to get into the university, how does she think that a 17-year-old has millions lying around? It hurts when you spend months and then you hear such things from your mother. Not only this I am running a startup that is funded as well yet she thinks it's a gimmick and calls me again so many things because of it. I have been silent and strong all through the years but there comes a point where you feel like crying like talking to someone, I have neither a brother nor a sister and I don't feel like sharing such things with my friends as well. There have been so many times that I have felt like ending my life and being free from all this. Even though I don't want to pursue engineering nor study physics or chemistry I have to write exams for it and when I put up this my family calls it a mere excuse to run away from responsibilities.

1buelf5;Does it get better/easier?;ALGiles;"I'm 26(M), I'm doing alright for myself financially, I've got a good, small group of close friends (I think), a loving girlfriend of almost 5 years and I have a clear vision of where I want to be in the future. I've looked at many of other post on here to see if someone can provide an answer but nothing quite helps so here we go...As I've said, I'm doing well generally speaking. I should be happy or proud of myself? Or, something? But... I'm not I feel like there is a huge void in my heart, I've tried filling every way possible, love, friendship, hobbies, work, material possessions, keeping fit and active. Nothing. Yeah I get that I'm most likely depressed and riddled with anxiety and many other issues, but there must be someway to feel happy?? I've tried opening up to a couple people, but all I get is ""you'll be fine, you've got us"", or, ""stop over thinking"". I get they may not know what to do to help, but its like... I'm stuck. I constantly think about how the world is fucked, about how humanity is a plague, about how we have so many unanswered questions and life and the universe, about how insignificant we all are, about what the government hides from us, about how so many people are ignorant to these things and can live their lives with such ""ease"". Maybe ignorance isn't the right term but, you get me right? I constantly have my thoughts filled with things that stress me. But nobody else I know does. I hate going to work having to deal with people who are beyond incompetent with such simple tasks. My patients day by day grows short and shorter. And it's starting to show to the people I love most. I don't know how to control it. I don't get physical at all but I get so incredibly annoyed with incompetence and stupidity. I've tried opening up with my deep feelings but I feel worse afterwards, like I'm pathetic. I just feel like I could break down and cry so hard but i just can't, I'm empty. I just bottle everything up and just carry on. I feel like nobody understands or can help. I've felt the pull of the death many times but I'm just not strong enough to end it, I've tried but, I couldn't go all the way through with it, it's not that I'm scared of dying, it's the pain before hand I'm terrified of. I feel like I have no escape. I've been like this for years now. Day by day getting worse little by little. I hope someone had found their way out of this situation. And give guidance or atleast hope. I guess to sum up:● How do I feel happy again?● How do I get rid of all the pain?● If I can feel happy again and release some of the pai. And stress, is it worth carrying on? Do I just put my fears aside and get it done with?I appreciate any guidance/advice/help possible :)";I'm 26(M), I'm doing alright for myself financially, I've got a good, small group of close friends (;REQUESTING ADVICE;4;2;2024-04-03 00:19:09;2024-04-03;Wednesday;00:19:09;2715;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:45.338349

1bu9z9c;Depressed Teacher: I've given up;please_elaborate-;"Let me start by saying that I am on medication for depression and I am actively seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. I have an appointment with my therapist on Friday but I just need some encouragement. Please no mean comments. I'm a Special Education teacher. I've been teaching for over a decade. I originally LOVED my job. I LOVED my students. I was your typical young, passionate educator even considering getting my master's. After COVID, things went downhill. Student expectations were shot. The bar was in hell. I had students graduating who couldn't fully read. The charter school I was working at was treating it's teachers poorly, so people were leaving and leaving more work for the rest of us. I eventually left after 2+ years. Then I worked for a public school. I really liked it there but I had a caseload of 45 students by myself. And more students were being diagnosed everyday. I was constantly being pulled into meetings instead of working in the classroom and admin basically said ""You agreed to work 7 days a week when you took this job""; I didn't. But everyone knows that ""teachers do it for the kids, not the paycheck.""I quit after a few months and tried to leave education for good by working at a start-up. It went the way you'd expect. They told me that I'd make $23 in training and then $25 after 3 months. Well after 3 months, they said sales were down so they couldn't afford my raise. $23 wasn't enough to cover my rent and I ate had to supplement my income with my $2,000 emergency fund. And then in August 2023, I started at a new school district. Back in education but this time at district level so I don't have to be in the classroom anymore, right? Wrong. By October they said that I couldn't keep up even though I was given a caseload of 650 students. I was the newest employee in my position and everyone else had a caseload of 200~ students. I was set up to fail and they said ""Well we don't want to fire you so we're transitioning you to a teaching role in the middle school.""And I couldn't quit. I had nowhere to go. Nobody will hire me and I was also recovering from some medical issues that led to a surgery over winter break. I literally had to keep my job solely for the insurance.And I'm still here. And I don't care. I already didn't want to be here. But no matter where I apply, I don't get calls back. I'm trapped in education. I either have to stay in this situation, in this school or I'm homeless. It's gotten so bad that half of the time, I don't even go into the building. I arrive at work and sit in my car. For hours. And then I show up to classes that I enjoy. But most of my classes are filled with the nastiest behavior that I've ever seen. No amount of lunch detention or in school suspension makes these kids respectful. I can't find the motivation to do anything. People have told me ""Well this job pays the bills.""It does. But that doesn't make me WANT to do my job. That's just a fact. I show up. I get paid. And even if I didn't show up, most schools are so desperate, I don't think they'd fire me.  I want it to CLICK in my brain that I have to do my job or I could lose everything.I'm taking night classes to try and pivot careers into something that makes me happy. But this could be an additional year of this. Guys wtf do I do? How do I force myself to do my fucking job? All I need to do is get through April and May. That's it.Please no mean comments.

I’m currently going through one of the worst depressions in my life and here’s a poem about what I’m feeling and about not having my mom here with me.  I hope this helps someone else feel less alone. 💕“What once was laughter began to turn darker,What once was joy, quickly grew into grief.That’s when the thoughts began, tempting me with sweet relief.Colors grew dull, wind became chill,The flowers I drew became weeds on a hill.Everything in this world has a price we must pay,But do we get to fulfill our price in our own way?Is my price to suffer while keeping my heart tender to others? To love, give, and comfort without the help of my mother?I begin to notice changes within my inner fire and tides,My reflection reveals what once were gleams of hope, drooped into sad eyes.”I know it’s not great, I’m not a poet but it’s how I feel.

1bu0fe9;Help with a stinky room?;abigmacmeal;"Not sure if this is the right spot to post this but hi guys. I’ve got an eating disorder as well as depression. My eating disorder makes my brain think that it’s way too scary to eat in front of people, so I eat in my room rather than common areas.Sometimes due to depression I can’t seem to clean dishes out right away. I’m pretty decent at it, like taking my ice cream bowl to the kitchen two days after I eat it.

It's like we're only family on a surface level...I was 2 when my father died, mom was left alone to raise us 3 kids, I'm the youngest. I know she did all she could to raise us, but fuck it. Now I've got multiple fucking issues with myself I can't even build relationships. I kinda blame my family for neglecting me (sorry I'm too tired to explain further, but I was emotionally neglected). I kinda still blame my shitty upbringing for how shitty I am now. I mean, FUCK!!!! I didn't want things to be like this!!! Why do I have to end up with multiple issues within myself just because the adults in my fucking life neglected me! Now I can't even fucking ""deal with it, you're an adult now"". I don't know what to do!!By 13, I had a boyfriend, welp, we're still together (I'm going 20 now). Yep, our relationship is kinda toxic because we were projecting our issues to one another at some point. But I don't want to break up with him. We're aware and talking about our issues now and are both willing to work on it. It's just hard on days that our issues get the best of us. Especially for me. I fucking hate myself. I don't feel enough. I get overly jealous. Even with him just talking with other girls. 🫥 I'm aware that that's so fucking toxic, yet I just don't know what to do with myself, I just want to disappear. Fuck I don't want to leave him, he's all I have. At 13, I was already suicidal because of my self issues, past sexual molestation, and pressure on me for ""being a smart kid"". Ordered some rope online to hang myself, but just couldn't, our roof was shitty lmao. Eventually I met this guy, he gave me reason to live. Even now, I still can't believe, I reached this age and I'm still alive when I decided to myself back then that I was gonna end it all. I just don't know what to do with myself.

1btso4u;What's Your Input?;8_gray_8;"[background]  I'm sitting in English class, and we're reading ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" As the teacher reads the novelette, we are asked to follow along in a study guide and answer the questions as we go.  I know I have to do this assignment. I'm a senior in highschool, and I need to pass this class to graduate.  However, but like most of my other classes, I'm averaging a D to an F.  Everytime that we fill out study guides as she reads, I always fail to complete them.  I'll start out strong with detailed notes of the passages answering all parts asked, but then I just stop.  My heart is racing, I can't focus.  I'm feeling waves of light-headedness pulsing through my head.  I can't sit still, and I feel like I'm stuck in some sort of game, following the rules against my will.  Am I just being lazy?  I dread going to school and doing assignments (especially my English ones), but I feel as if everyone else does at least a little bit.  So why do I find myself mentally incapable of doing my schoolwork?  I have been diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and BPD (borderline personality disorder).  Despite receiving the official diagnoses only recently, I have obviously struggled with some of the aspects of them for quite some time.  But is what I'm experiencing just laziness or is it caused by my mental illnesses?  Part of me doesn't think it's laziness, because my lack of motivation and ability to do assignments I don't want to do has been a constant issue all throughout my years of school.  Then again, no one wants to be called or admit that they're lazy.  I feel as if I'm a failure and not made to succeed... like I'm disappointing those around me, but don't care because I dont think I'm going to make it very long after highschool.  Basically, the other part of me believes that I am lazy.  I care to extent about this dilemma (as I'm writing this), but even so, I don't care?  Caring about something to the point where I take initiative to combat the problem just takes a quantity of motivation and focus that something this large with significant impact on my day-to-day life strips me of.  Just writing this, I've caught myself going through episodes of dissociation that last multiple minutes.  (I should also mention that I don't experience this problem when it comes to my job, but my current occupation is also something I enjoy doing.)[inquiry]  I guess what input I would want from this post would be if you this is laziness, or a possible outcome of my diagnoses.  I will of course be expressing my concern with my therapist next time we speak, but other opinions would very much be appreciated.";"[background]  I'm sitting in English class, and we're reading ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr";REQUESTING ADVICE;1;1;2024-04-02 07:27:53;2024-04-02;Tuesday;07:27:53;2660;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:45.364099
1btreos;Mild depression;talesoffillory;I’m sat on my couch, where I have been for the past three hours since the power went out and my 4 year old woke up. I was reading a book on depression and it made me realise something. I am depressed. Sounds silly doesn’t it. I suffer from major depressive episodes and take medication as maintenance dose to increase when an episode hits.So realising I am depressed considering the above sounds stupid. What I mean though, is that when I have a major depressive episode, I become barely able to function. It is horrendous. So because I don’t feel like that, I haven’t realised that I am actually depressed right now. I’m just not in a full blown episode. There are circumstantial reasons for it. I am a single parent and two of my children are disabled, the youngest in a wheelchair. I am not able to work due to their care requirements. I live very rural and don’t drive. My days are spent in the same way, day after day. I rarely leave my house and over the past six months, have spent more and more time escaping from my reality with video games. Every day I make sure my children are looked after and loved, and in between, I try to be as detached from the real world as I can be. I don’t want to think, or feel. Just exist so my kids are taken care of. I am on a waiting list for a wheelchair accessible house, in town, and have been for a year. Every day I hope the postman will be dropping a letter through my door saying there is a house. Like all my problems with be magically solved if I can move. And some of them would be. My youngest has so many appointments but the public transport is awful here. He has to miss nursery to go to appointments because of the timing of the transport IF it comes. I would be closer to my older disabled child who struggles in school due to his disability. I would be able to see my adult children more and my one friend who is disabled herself. But it’s not going to be a magic cure. I thought unless I was in an episode, I didn’t have depression but now I am realising, I will always have depression. Sometimes it will be extreme and other times it will be like this. Flat, existing, escaping but functioning at least on a basic level. I will never be the person I was before my first depressive episode and after ten years, it’s time I learned to accept that depression is a part of me and will never fully go away. And I don’t think that accepting this is a bad thing. I think accepting this is empowering. It is another step in understanding and managing this illness. I’ve been so hard on myself, because I have been doing the basics and beating myself up for being lazy, not being adult enough, not being a person who copes. Because I thought I was well. Because I’m not in a major episode. Now I see that I am still unwell. Not as obviously, but still unwell.;I’m sat on my couch, where I have been for the past three hours since the power went out and my 4 ye;OTHER;1;1;2024-04-02 06:03:38;2024-04-02;Tuesday;06:03:38;2812;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:45.365507
1btr2ga;Most of my family is dead, not sure where to go from here or what’s worth it anymore. ;ExistentialxParadox;Hi thanks for reading if you made it here. I’m a 28F having a really hard time managing my mind lately. Just some backstory:We grew up poor, this had a lot to do with a general anxiety/depression from the start. In 2012 my dad got sick. Since he was the main source of income, our house foreclosed and we (mom, dad, older, & younger brother) moved into a house with my grandma - who was recovering from lung cancer. I started my first year of college and my dad passed away a couple months into my first semester. I was 18In 2016 my mom got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and was put on feeding tubes. I had quit my job to take care of her full time and take her to chemo. She passed in 2017. I was 22. Just recently, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and while on short term disability from work to figure out treatment, my grandma passed away due to pneumonia complications. I feel extreme sadness and contemplate the purpose of life daily. I even quit my decent paying bank job after 8 years in my career with the company. My 2 brothers before mentioned, never helped with my parents when they were sick even though we all lived together. We haven’t lived together since 2018 and they only contact me if they want money so I have been cutting them off. I have my fiancé, but he’s a truck driver and is only home a couple days a week. His son, which is virtually as my own, is one of the few people along with my fiancé that are keeping me going. I just have this immense sense of loss, no direction, and I feel like I’m starting to destroy my life.

1btoegy;I feel hopeless ;Worried-Purple3291;Hello, I am a girl and 19 years old. Last year, my boyfriend broke up with me in the middle of exams to top off an absolutely nightmarish final year of high school. I have always been academically excellent, but during my last year of school due to multiple events, I ended up being unable to study for my school leaving exams and in a state of dissociation in the exam room. This meant all my academic aspirations were at least put in the back burner for now as I ended up, due to bad grades, studying a course I dislike ( engineering) at a university which I feel won’t help me grow and develop into the person I want. Parallel to this, I have been struggling with my mental health for the last 5 years ever since the unexpected death of my grandmother, who was my primary caregiver.  Especially over the last 3 years, I have been struggling a lot with religion, belief in god, an afterlife and life’s purpose by extension. This has made me completely dysfunctional, as I can’t find meaning in anything due to my hesitance with god, and I can’t seem to derive a sense of fulfilment from the popular current ethos of “we make our own meaning”. As that seems inherently antithetical to meaning for me, surely if we can define meaning as anything we like, things are meaningless and therefore there is no meaning, just illusion. The worst impact on my daily life as a student stems from my disillusionment with the academic process and me pursuing a degree I do not find knowledge acquisition fulfilling in, on top of this, my parents like to reality check me often and place ultimate meaning in money (something engineering gets you a stable amount of) which further disillusions me. This makes me feel that learning stuff is useless, and this has been a core part of my identity since I was a little girl. Therefore, I have no motivation to go about every day student life. I have attended a total of 5 lectures this year. Whilst I am quite capable and this won’t harm my final exam performance, at least in first year, I am not invested in anything anymore. I am taking steps to try to get over the depression like going to the gym, but I’m up every night till 6 am with my thoughts and have no idea how to get back to the version of me who had faith in life’s purpose and derived enjoyment from learning and could feel happy in daily life.;Hello, I am a girl and 19 years old.

1btm7aq;Just feeling so down, pls offer some honest advice or support.;No_Statistician_6135;I (25m) am writing this the night before a medical degree exam for which Im completely fucked and will have to repeat, ruining my summer plans, so thats likely compounding on my feelings right now but I am feeling so isolated and depressed about my life situation.Other than still being enroled in a medical programme, my life is shit. All of these:1) Relationships2) Aademics3) Finances4) Mental/physical healthare spiralling and I dont know where to begin with fixing any of it.1. Relationships - My long term gf and I broke up from what was admittedly a toxic and draining relationship in recent months, but even though I dont regret it ending, theres nobody whos really there for me when I need them now. I dont think I can open up to any friends about things. I just feel so alone. My parents are the closest option, but even though they do really care about me, my lack of succes so far in life really takes the centre stage in defining our relationship dynamics, which are strained. For context >2) Academics -  I have dropped out of a course prior to this one, and have had to repeat a year in my medical course, which has left my parents understandably frustrated with me. Really since 18 i have been failing academically, and I am ~4 yrs behind where I would be in life had I proceeded in a linear fashion out of school. And after tomorrow I now once again am having to repeat exams.3) Finances  - I live away from home, but in a family property, and I am dependant on my family for a set amount of weekly expenses while in school. I do not work since about a year ago as I struggled to manage. I end up with just enough for very basic necessities and no more. All my friends from outside my course are now beginning to advance into careers and earn money which makes me feel left behind. It will be 2 yrs before I am qualified (if I do) and am earning. The lack of money and control over my life is frustrating, and I just feel so trapped in the situation from a financial standpoint. 4) Health - All of the above has really made me begin to feel depressed. All my friends lives, both in medicine and out, seem to be going so well and it just makes my feel sad to compare. I have really been struggling to find the motivation to leave my bed in recent weeks (at the expense of college), all I have been doing is using my phone and barely studying. My fitness is also terrible. My room is a kip. I just feel so defeated by life right now.I am unsure how to get myself out of this situation and just feel so hopeless. I feel the answers require money for therapy which I dont have. I feel my only recourse is in my parents but the guilt of already depending on them as I do whilst also disappointing them makes me feel trapped and unable to reach out.

I told both of the family members I live with about how bad my depression is.(Leaving out my attempt because I desperately want to avoid the psych ward.) I'm going to refer to them as G and A in the rest of this post. Brief summary of my situation before I continue: 19, no job, haven't graduated highschool (failed twice, wasted $4,000), extreme anxiety and lacking motivation. G was very supportive and A...wasn't. G just wanted to help me calm down after a basically sobbed through the whole thing and ended up making A leave the room when A got angry at me. A refused to talk to me for several days until this Sunday when G requested that A doesn't ruin Easter. A and I finally talked, it went about as well as expected. A talked about how disappointed they were in me and how I apparently don't seem to care about how I impacted A with my actions. As well as giving me till the end of April to find a job. I don't know if A would actually kick me out if I don't find a job. The issue is that I don't have a license nor have I graduated highschool. My options for work are very limited. And frankly, I don't know how well working would go for me. I didn't have enough motivation to even graduate highschool or take care of myself most days. My anxiety is so bad that I can barely talk to the clerk at a store. I don't know what to do. I'm already seeing a psychiatrist and I have my first counseling appointment on the 14th of April. None of the medications have helped so far. I've briefly looked into maybe getting financial aid? Apparently you can be labeled disabled if you have depression in some cases.

1bthisr;Not Suicidal, Just Don't Want to Live / Wellbutrin;TheCosmicCoven;"Hey friends,I am writing this, because life has been so incredibly hard lately. I used to be someone that was SO optimistic, motivated, groovy, I knew what I wanted in life, and I have achieved so god damn much. Recently, about 6 months ago, something happened (I won't go in to detail because I don't have the energy), but since then, I have fallen into what has taken me a long time to label as depression. I never, ever, in my entirety of existence thought I'd be sitting here right now writing this, I always had the mindset: ""that will never happen to me."" And guess what, it did. I am stuck in this place where I do not think of self harm, and I have zero suicidal ideation, however, I also feel I quite often do not have any will to live. Life feels exhausting, and sometimes I just wish I could disappear without loved ones knowing, as I am surrounded by so many loving people and I'd do nothing to myself that would cause them hurt. I am basically in a state of constant anxiety due to the thought of a skin illness relapsing again, and the constant underlying depression of what that would look like living with this if it were to become significant again and/or progress, and how it would affect my life. (I'm not talking acne, even though this can also be debilitating). I guess I am just posting this to get my words out. Some key terms I can label of how I feel with all of this right now are: Depressed, hopeless, exhausted, frustrated, ""done"", discouraged, and lost in life. I have been debating calling my doctor and asking to try a low dose of Wellbutrin/Bupropion. I have heard good things about it, and that it has minimal side effects. Has anyone here tried it? If so, what was/is your experience like? It just feels like I can't move on, as I still have minor symptoms of what I went through originally, and it's like the disease is trying to fuck with my mind saying ""I'll always be here waiting for my moment."" I know that sounds stupid, but it's fucked me up emotionally. Badly. All thoughts, or just words of support are appreciated. <3";Hey friends,I am writing this, because life has been so incredibly hard lately.

1btddr3;Severe anxiety&depression;;Hey guys, I just wanted to get something off my chest. I've been struggling with severe anxiety (GAD) and depression for 3 years now. Since then I didn't have a single moment in my life which I enjoyed or at least in which I didn't worry. I've been putting myself through university and got my degree, but it's pretty much worthless since I am not able to get a decent job (it's hard to explain, but in my country the single degree doesn't get you anywhere, you definitely need a second one). But in the last year my condition got worse and worse and then my Ex broke up with me - because of the depression/anxiety I wasn't able to do anything, enjoy time or activities together etc. I don't blame her at all for breaking up, mental health conditions are very hard in a relationship, even if you're not the one having one. With my ex gone the last thing in my life which gave me at least a little bit of hope/joy/safety/... vaporized into thin air. I've been crying so much and I'm not able to enjoy anything in my life whatsoever, even though my friends and my family are supportive, they don't know how to help me. I've been in therapy for about 2 years, I tried several medication but nothing seems to help me. The hopelessness - of course a symptom of the depression itself - gets worse and worse. Since I am not able to stop ruminating and worrying, I can't focus on anything, I don't feel anything positive at all. I am just sad and anxious from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep, and this repeats every day. I know no one here can heal me, but I would really appreciate some tips and tricks to deal with this situation. I know I'm not the only one feeling like this :);Hey guys, I just wanted to get something off my chest.

1bshq7r;Feeling Unloved;Lounay;"I feel unloved and unappreciatedHi everyone, I post here from time to time but my headspace is gotten so much worse. I get so annoyed with myself but I can't stop the way I'm feeling.To set the scene. I am a 24f and have been with my fiancè for five years. We live in a three bedroom house with a small lawn (important for later). He makes the most money and as I am still studying I make next to nothing at my retail job. My parents came to visit for easter and I was happy to see them but I work weekends too.Now work has been hard as I pour so much effort into my job and I do things that are not required nor am I paid for to help improve it but my boss still always says it's not enough and if sales don't improve the shop will close and I'm to blame. It's made my depression a lot worse. I have been thinking of quiting as it's making me suicidal but my dad says I give up to easily and that I must stop being overemotional. He's always been like this one of the big reasons for my depression. Any way, so when I come home after a rough day at work I am excited to see our pets. We have two cats and one dog. However over the last year none of them are really loving or want to be near me when I need them most.I talk to my fiancè but even though he listen he doesn't understand and his way to help me is to give me the ""basic"" solutions everyone always does. Go back to your psychologist, change your pills etc.So work makes me feel useless, my dad makes me feel like a failure for wanting to quit. My fiancè makes me feel unloved and like he doesn't listen really or try to understand my mind. Then the little guys I care for uncoditionally ignores me.I feel like such a waste of space. I think I need something/someone who can provide me with love and attention constantly ( I know it's not healthy). So I brought up the idea of getting a psychiatric service dog and my fiancè says it's just another excuse to get more pets and more responsibilities. Has any one felt like this? What helped? Would a PSD who can be by my side always help or make a worse co-dependancy?";I feel unloved and unappreciatedHi everyone, I post here from time to time but my headspace is gotte;REQUESTING ADVICE;2;3;2024-03-31 18:51:12;2024-03-31;Sunday;18:51:12;2077;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:46.657674

I don’t like talking about my emotions much, maybe everything is piling up at once.

1bscauj;Therapist said killing myself is always an option.;itsrainingbluekiwis;I need some advice.So he didn’t mean it that way but I just think that was a careless thing to say since I’m struggling with suicidal ideation. In one way, we have options and killing ourselves is always an option, in another perspective killing ourselves should never be an option. The fact that it was layed out on the table for me to begin with was probably not okay…I was complaining on how I was suicidal and am stuck in a bad living situation and have no car and he was like you wanna kill your self because you have no car? That’s always an option or you can keep trying to get out of there (the bad living situation). I commented that it sounded calloused and showed lack of compassion. He shrugged and said “Alright. You can write me off as an uncompassionate guy.” But then encouraged me to keep finding a way out and said “don’t give up.”(I’m also Christian and he said “I’m surprised that someone with your faith is having these thoughts”…that didn’t help. He said that followed by “have faith”. It felt so up and down.)My living situation is not the only reason why I’m having these thoughts but I guess understand what he was trying to get at here.

1br9s6p;This has been the worst year of my life…;EffectExtension4725;Full disclosure. Not asking for handouts. I know nobody really cares. This world is not kind. As of February I was kicked out of school and out the dorms because financial aid was too high and i wasn’t fully covered and barely made enough to be able to pay the rest. I have one parent who hardly talks to me and wouldn’t help me claim as an independent. Anyway blah blah blah messy money hungry school bs. Worst part is they only gave me a week notice that i had to pay over $7000 or leave. So here i am. 3 miles from my dream school that i can no longer attend. In a tiny studio apartment just hoping i can make this work…. And then boom…….. lost my job(long annoying story). I had just enough money saved up for March rent and my car note and stuff and then yet another curve ball… had to get my ignition replaced because my car key wouldn’t turn. Im trying to figure it out for April’s rent because all the money i had left went to fixing my car. I gave up trying to ask for help. Nobody has been helping. Nobody wants to. I put aside my pride and asked and cried and nobody cares…. I refuse to be homeless (although it wouldn’t be the first time).I thought about doing… questionable… things to get the money but nah. Ugh i gotta figure this out tho and quick.Jobs dont hire like they used to ive been searching for a new job since way before i left my other one. Im am getting my ass absolutely handed to me this year. Starting to think maybe good things dont happen to good people. Those people just happen to be lucky.

1bpzj9x;Gf is depressed and I need advice;Mordred_Pasha;So my girlfriend is feeling anxiety and depressed for the last 3 months. Everything started because she was uncomfortable being in a long distance relationship. We are together for 4 years and we did LDR and never seen each other since last august. I know crazy. But it was impossible because I had no passport for some time and she could not get a visa to visit me. So it was not a choice. In January she talked about how she wants to come and live with me because she can’t take it. I was financially unstable and still am. I am stopping my acting career to enable us living together. This might sound selfless but she had done the same for me when I needed her. She will see her psychiatrist tomorrow and they will do further tests to diagnose what she has. I love her so much. She is constantly sleeping. She tells me that she loves me and I am doing everything she would want me to. She tells me that I am enough but I want to do more. TLDR: Gf is in depression and anxiety. She tells me that I am doing enough but I want to do more. Thanks;So my girlfriend is feeling anxiety and depressed for the last 3 months.

No aspect of life be it family, friends, employment goals or hobbies brings me any spark of joy. I do not see life as something worth living to me as I simply don't enjoy or value it. I have recently been considering the military as just something to keep me busy but i feel it would just make things worse. at this point every support system short of experimental treatments such as ketamine therapy or cranial electro stimulation has failed me and just added more to my sense of not being interested in life.I have no fallback childhood dreams or goals as I was still a very melancholic individual going back as far as i can remember. I'm not sure how I'm meant to just keep throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks when I'm literally broke from therapy and meds that haven't helped yet.The only times in my life where I have had any joy were from toxic co dependant relationships where I was just feeding off of my partners happiness as a crutch. I have no idea what to do outside of continuing to try random shit until it either kills me or I am magically fixed by the right hobby. for context I have pretty severe autism which makes a lot of the usual suggestions of being more social a bit moot as having friends significantly drains me emotionally and leaves me even more depressed.;I, 23m, have been suffering from depressing, anhedonia and suicidal urges since at least the age of ;REQUESTING ADVICE;2;1;2024-03-28 08:32:55;2024-03-28;Thursday;08:32:55;1597;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:46.721488

1bpe2xt;How To Keep Your Home Clean ;AnnaDeGrimaud;"This post goes to everyone that's struggling to keep everything clean at home - whether you live alone or with other people. I saw a post from someone here and, I honestly hope that it helps you too! GIVE YOURSELF A WEEK Divide your apartment or house into rooms or groups of rooms, depending on the size. Start with the room you want to clean the most first (that you're more motivated to clean) and then move on to the next ones as the days go by. At the end of a week, everything must be finished. Also, do this every month. If you clean regularly it will be easier and more pleasant to clean. If you can get some people to help you, it will be great for you all! Take the opportunity to chat. And give them a hand when they need help with cleaning too. They'll appreciate it a lot! MINIMALIST Become a minimalist and let go of everything that you don't need. Donate or sell and you'll find solutions to your current problems either way. If it is spiritual, you'll know that the people who got those items are making good use of it and you'll feel at peace; if it is financial, you can sell these items and pay off debts, or have money to pay for bills, or make an emergency fund. PLAYLIST Put some upbeat or relaxing songs to play. This will make the experience of cleaning interesting. You can dance around, pretend you're a singer or that you're singing with your favorite singers. Just have have through the process and you won't feel as overwhelmed anymore.

A few months back I had reluctantly visited a psychiatrist (a friend took me) just to talk about it and seek professional help. I was prescribed stalopam, and she gave me a diagnosis of MDD (major depressive disorder). It has fucked my life up significantly I'm not gonna lie. I was the kinda prodigy kid, getting the best grades and topping my class, without studying much or studying last minute. This was all till 10th grade. Everything went downhill. Right now I'm pursuing an Computer Science degree lmao and it's a struggle.

I’ve been trying to patch up my life for years and trying to heal the “causes” of it with little success but I’m beginning to wonder if it’s because it was actually NPD.;ihaveaquestionopedia;I give too much attention to my issues and problems.I always end up struggling interpersonally. I thought it was severe shyness or social anxiety, then I thought its depression or maybe avoidant personality issues exacerbated by severe panic disorder. But I’m often struggling the most when it comes to adjusting with other people or compromising my needs or my preferences. I feel like I’m very rarely actually there for other people, i fear that so much I’ve made myself practically unavailable by using anxiety and panic as an excuse. I always feel like I’m not doing enough but I can’t find the courage or motivation to do more and I think maybe it’s because I don’t care enough, that I have that “lack of empathy”. I used to be horrible as a teenager and early adult, much worse, I would antagonise everyone and has this attitude of being “cooler” than people around me even though I knew I’m not and I’m just avoiding people because of severe low esteem. I’ve ended up being really awful to people, at times I would be like that and realised after I had already behaved like that. I’ve just been stacking up guilt from that and now I spend most of my hours filled with so much shame I can hardly look myself in the mirror. I’ve been trying to work in my self esteem and perception. I’ve been doing as much as I can to be more empathetic to people, to becoming more selfless, to becoming less ego oriented but I feel like my ego is so clever it’s using this activity too to feel better about itself (see spiritual narcissism).I fear there is no escaping my ego and that I will end up hurting people inadvertently because I have too much self preservation/protection inside me. I fear that I will be manipulative without me realising that I’m doing that and even I do I’ll just excuse it or find some other kind of manipulation to ultimately make things go the way my brain has decided they should. I have a really hard time letting go of control though I am working on that but not very diligently.Is it possible to actually heal this or get better about it and to actually make sure you don’t end up using people in your life to serve some sort of self serving purpose. I’ve reached that point of loneliness where I actually don’t know what friend are for and have to consciously remind myself. I don’t think I’m a genuinely nice or kind or caring person although I do feel other people’s pain and sorrow but only when I allow myself to feel emotions because otherwise I get overwhelmed easily. I used to think I’m very cool and strong that I didn’t cry easily or feel pain or emotions although I was actually a crybaby in secret and the only emotions I felt freely were irritating and anger. Although for some years since I’ve been in therapy I’ve been working on  allowing myself to feel the full spectrum of emotions and I’ve really opened up there so I thought I was getting better. I’m able to feel other people’s happiness in fact seeing other people happy now makes me really happy and I wish everyone on this planet would find joy and happiness. Although sometimes if it’s someone close to me I do get jealous because of how being I am in everything in life? I’m really afraid I won’t be able to cope with my narcissism if that’s what it is.

1bp8nfl;Don’t know how to deal with depression room ;StardustSprinkle22;I’ve had a not so great depression apartment for about a year (a year ago my younger brother died) and every time it got a little better it got way worse again due to life things (2 uncles dying, diagnosed with osteoarthritis, losing my job, dad getting diagnosed with cancer). I also have been diagnosed with depression and ADHD, and I have a sleep study next month because a specialist thinks I have hypersomnia. My parents have visited from out of state twice in the past year and I try to clean up before they come but there’s always still laundry piled up and things generally messy and they just scream at me and threaten to throw everything away and take me back home since I “have shown that I can’t handle living on my own since I can’t do day to day tasks.” They don’t get why it’s so difficult for me (and has become more difficult since developing arthritis), and what doesn’t help is my mom is an actual germaphobe (I don’t mean that lightly, she actually is one) and my dad is most likely a narcissist and he also doesn’t believe in pain meds (like he’s had surgeries and just doesn’t take any pain meds because he believes in pushing through it). In the past week I’ve made good progress. The living room floor is mostly clear, same with the bedroom floor other than a junk corner (which I’m debating leaving there), though I have an estimated 20 loads of laundry laying around in piles and my kitchen is full of full garbage bags and the kitchen needs to be cleaned and dishes done. And then I have stuff that needs to be put away but I can’t because of all the laundry. I’m worried about having everything done tomorrow evening with the fact that a load of laundry takes 2 hours due to the crappy machines and I can’t stand more than 10min at a time before having to rest for an hour because of my pain. Even then I know it won’t be clean enough for them and I don’t know how to mentally prepare myself for their anger. They’ve already been sending me snarky texts about their arrival. And I especially want the place to be nice because this is the last time my parents are visiting before my dad starts another round of chemo and then has surgery. I just need advice/help/support because I’m sitting here crying and I don’t know what to do. I’ve already done so much and I’ve probably done no less than 30 loads of laundry in the past 4 days and I feel like my body and mind is breaking.

1bp6gdg;Psychiatrist diagnosing me w/ bipolar due to SSRI insomnia?;ShredAloha;As the title says, my psychiatrist is shifting my diagnosis from depression to possible bipolar because of insomnia caused by SSRIs, and I’m not sure I’m able to take that at face value. It seems like insomnia is a pretty common side effect? I will say that I did have more energy on the SSRI I took despite being completely unable to sleep, but couldn’t that just be related to the anti-depressant effect? Also, my depression got worse again after I discontinued the SSRI, which seems unlikely if the SSRIs really did trigger mania. If I really do have bipolar, that would make me reevaluate a few spiritual periods I have had in my life. But I do have a sense that my therapist might be overreacting here. I’m also scared to start taking Lamictal, which I’ve just been prescribed — many people say it causes brain fog and makes them “less sharp” — I already have bad executive function so I’m worried about how brain fog could impact what meager organizational skills I currently possess.

1bp5si5;I don’t recognize myself anymore;Flaky-Classroom-9319;Since the beginning of this year, I came back to my old bad habits. I am in my second year in highschool, and the first year was bad, I was depressed and gave up but I managed to get back quickly on track even if I missed a lot of classes. However this year, one of the most important ones, I already gave up because of high expectations I had and being hard to meeting them unfortunately. I can’t stop comparing myself and I just accepted I couldn’t reach the level I wanted and I was feeling so bad that I couldn’t even study properly because of how depressed it made me. School was always the most important thing in my life, but since last year I chose to not study from time to time because I thought I sucked at everything, which I wasn’t objectively but I see it and it’s not enough. Anyway what I am here for is also because I missed a lot of classes and it puts pressure onto my mom everyday because of it. I was never someone that she would worry about for school since I was the serious type unlike my siblings. Now it’s the contrary, I am the worst for her, I feel like I push her limits every time.I don’t feel anything anymore, I am so indifferent it actually scares me. I don’t know how to wake up my soul (if that makes sense). I leads me to be content to just ignore the world and focus on my phone, being on the internet, in my bed all day. I have no shame. I went from the « good child » to a demon, an entity that stays in her house and causes her all this pain. Please how can I wake up,I am lost, I sometimes feel like she genuinely starts to hate me (she says she doesn’t) but I don’t believe it, I convince myself. My other siblings I am 100% they hate me.

Here's my rant.I just lost a 2nd job within a year. I have just managed to pull my own self out of financial debt, and here I am again, about to settle for a job that pays lesser cause it's the only option I have. This has been going for for my last 2 employments. 2 Jobs within 12 months. During all these ups and downs, I met this girl (9 months ago) that I have fallen in love with. She's very ready for the real commitment, and I'm down for it with her. I'm falling behind while she's doing well for herself. She's been patient with me, and that makes me feel way more fucked up that I'm not able to start making the real shit happen.On my family front, we've always been in debt for most of our lives. we're about to (hopefully) finally close all that soon. 3 of us work hard to keep things running. 1 (my elder brother) is a super strong support system is is pretty much taking all the burden by himself. My mother still contributes, and well me.. I do my little bit. I'll address some more problems. I drink everyday. My mother does too. My father and brother don't. Me and my mother are aware of the problem but just can't seem to fight it post sunset. I want to quit. I smoke pot too. And cigarettes. I want to quit all that.

1bogsst;Have I solved my overthinking problem?;tottenb2;I’ve been currently dealing with my depression and anxiety with a partial hospitalization program to learn effective coping skills. One thing that really spoke to me was ACT, because one of my biggest problems was overthinking. Through ACT, I learned that it has been effective to accept my negative emotions and move towards the value-based behaviors of curiosity and open-mindedness. In other words, if I am obsessing over a perfect solution to a problem, I should approach it with open-mindedness and do whatever potential solution my brain comes up with, without worrying whether it’ll work or not.This has been helping me the past few weeks, but I realized something troubling the other day. Even if this has been working, it can’t be a perfect solution to overthinking, because perfect solutions don’t exist. Since I tend to overthink everything, I’ve been using this technique all the time, and now I’m worried it won’t work anymore. I’m getting stuck on obsessing over what open-mindedness even means, and when and how I should use it, and whether it will even work or not.Any advice on this?;I’ve been currently dealing with my depression and anxiety with a partial hospitalization program to;REQUESTING ADVICE;1;1;2024-03-26 19:34:40;2024-03-26;Tuesday;19:34:40;1100;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:48.047793

1boflq2;Should I be worried about my friend? (Hasnt texted in three days);daddychiIII;Hello everyone, I have been helping my depressed friend for about a couple of weeks now.  During the day, I'd always check up on her, and she'd always reply within the same hour.  Also during school, we'd also hang out almost every day, and we'd be together for more than 24 hours.  She has a boyfriend but she doesn't tell him or any other her friends about her mental problems.  She also goes to a therapist daily to talk.  So in terms of how depressed she is on a scale from 1-5, I'd say it is probably a good 4 or high three.  She has shown signs of self-harm but nothing too serious.  She's also been dealing with a lot of relationships and financial stuff.  I do my best to help her by paying for some of her food and gas when we go out.  It isn't unusual for her not to text back for a long period, but for three days, should I be worried and should I start calling?  As I said, she's a good texter, and she'd always reply the day of, so I don't know if I'm being too overboard too you know.P.S.: In terms of the way we text, we are college students and our friendship is lighthearted so keep that in mind haha!

I'm 38 now and I'm so fucking exhausted. Around 2015 I was an inpatient at a psych ward and I was okay for a few years. I still had no passion or drive to do anything, but I didn't feel sad and only a little hollow. I was okay with that. It was so much better than feeling empty and doing nothing but cry, sleep and eat. I was taking care of myself, which was difficult, but manageable. I was working on convincing myself to go back to school. I took in a puppy and was staying active with her. I was bathing and brushing my teeth daily. Do you have any idea how difficult that is when you don't care about anything? (I'm sure if you're in this sub and reading this you do and I'm truly sorry you have to live with this too.) I was even actively losing weight! I was so fucking proud of myself for finally being in a place where I had enough in me to try to be better. It was so nice.About a month ago I started experiencing early menopause symptoms (my depression is heavily influenced by my reproductive system) I've been feeling myself slipping back into that deep, dark hole a little further every day since. I'm not sleeping at night and napping during the day. I've stopped paying attention to what I eat, or how much. I've gaine weight back. I've slowed down so much. I'm crying more and more.

If they did, it wasn't like the depression and anxiety were gone, it was just less. And although I was generally unhappy all the time, I figured that was as good as it was going to get.I took the genesight test this year (because my I had no idea that I was doing this, but for the entirety of my adult life I have been continually just checking the clock on the wall or my watch, waiting for things to be over.

Bit of context about me: I’m a 17 year old guy who has Asperger’s so always struggled socially. However the last 2 yrs has gotten worse. I now have no friends, no one wants to hangout with me and I have no social experiences. I have never been to a party or a trip with mates or anything like that. I haven’t even hungout with anyone in months because every time I try to people just say they are busy. I have tried to make friends and fill my time and that hasn’t worked. I have joined a football club, a gym, talked to people at school, got a job and none of that has worked. I just want to be normal and idk what I can do to change because I am putting myself out there and getting nothing back. I just want like 1-2 close friends and go to parties and a holiday every now and then. I have also never had a girlfriend as I am ugly and autistic. I’d also love to have a girlfriend but feel like every girl sees me as a loser because I have no friends or social life even though it’s not my fault.

1bo2loc;If I don't have a goal I'm interested in I get depressed;steelewebb91;This will be Long so bear with me.All my life I have had trouble applying myself, not because of laziness. Because once I become competent at something I get bored and it becomes bland and hard to keep motivated and concentrated. In school classes such as literature I would be the person reading four paragraphs ahead in group reading, would pass with 100% on tests but still have a C average cause I never did homework. Soon as I got home I had other things that I would get side tracked on. I would do homework sometimes on the bus because I didn't have much to keep me occupied besides screaming kids and looking out the window.Fast forward to adulthood, I took a technical class during high school ( carpentry), started fixing cars, learned how to weld, learned to build computers, retail manager, truck repair manager,  freight locomotive conductor, and freight locomotive engineer. The only job or hobby I didn't drop because of lost interest was the locomotive ones because I got laid off and  started having seizures (hereditary) and couldn't continue that career.Now to depression if I don't have some type of project that interests or engages me I just can't feel happy I stop eating I want to sleep all day It like I don't have the will to live. (Not saying I'm suicidal I'm saying I don't feel like I have a purpose). Best example I can give is I remodeled the bathroom over the last two weeks. I woke up early had coffee, learned how to work with copper plumbing how different companies use different mixing valves and how to replace them. Used some my carpentry to rebuild some walls that the old shower had leaked on and ruined. Now that the job is finished I'm bored and can't focus anymore. I have tried basically every depression med available no e have helped some even make problems worse. Only seizure meds I am taking are gabapentin, because all the others also have mood lAltering effects that cause me issues. I'm not socially awkward I don't have social anxiety. Best short explanation is if something doesn't stimulate me I can focus or enjoy life.Does anyone understand or get what I'm going through. My wife can't wrap her head around it. However she can play candy crush, or color by number for 13 hours and enjoy it.

I moved out months ago to gain independence during my gap year, whatever, I've been doing great looking in from the outside. My mental health has been bad for a while now. In and out of therapy since I was 12, assaulted at 15, put on antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medicine, sleep aids, all based on trial and lots of error from then on. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, severe anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, ADHD, and multiple kinds of chronic pain, which really doesn't help the depression. I went (doc approved) med-free for a few months last year, and the outcome was about where I'm at now mentally.I feel absolutely hopeless. My mom drove two hours to my apartment to surprise me for my birthday and all I could think about was how much better her life would be without me in it. How much better her life would have been by now if I wasn't weighing her down. My psychiatrist can't up my current medication or change it until my severe abdominal pain is looked at by specialists, but I need help.Every day is a blur. I feel like an empty shell with occasional flashes of anger. I've been missing work to sleep all day. I'm barely eating. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm always so negative and I hate that about myself too.

1bny8lj;Alone/overwhelmed/guilty;Competitive_Yak_1112;I (20m) have struggled w low self esteem anxiety and depression most of my life but particularly 14 onwards. My years like 13-17 were not good both mentally and decision makimg wise. Ever since around 13 ive drank alot as a coping mechanism which just led to worse situations. My life turned around not long before my 18th birthday when freshly out of a dubious relationship w a 21 yr old addict i reconnected w a friend from the start of high school and almost instantly we became so close and to this day she (19f) is my closest friend in the world and for awhile things were going better i still had bad days and problems but i had a positive influence in my life that i loved infinitly more than myself. In the last year or so however i feel like something has changed between us. While i had to mature early due to the things around me she lived a sheltered life but as weve reached this stage in our lives ive struggled to make the jump from mature teenager to functioning adult wheras by the time she was 18 she was employed full time and in a healthy longish term relationship. Even now i struggle to find work because of anxiety and my drinking. It basically just feels like we are at different points in our lives as she has other friends and a job and stuff and while she still sometimes tries to spend time w me i feel like im holding her back and that shes only still around me because we were so close for a time that she feels like she cant just say shes had enough of me. Also shes developed a drinkimg problem of her own that can only really be my fault cos she didnt like drinking until i suggested she have a drink to feel better while she was upset last year, she now goes through multiple bottles of spirit a week just sat alone in her room. I feel like for her sake i should be the one to call it quits on our friendship cos its clearly unhealthy for her but shes the only good thing in my life and i cant imagine life without my best friend even if we have drifted a little lately.;I (20m) have struggled w low self esteem anxiety and depression most of my life but particularly 14 ;REQUESTING SUPPORT;1;1;2024-03-26 03:43:18;2024-03-26;Tuesday;03:43:18;2004;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:48.080058

Im broke, mentally fucked up, drinking 8-10 drinks myself to numb the anxiety and riddled with anxiety and desperately desire just to wake up and have a peaceful environment where im not being mentally and emotionally abused by a worthless alcoholic. Im basically so mentally debilitated I cannot “strive for higher things” which in reality would bring me long term freedom like independence, living on my own, having my own place etc. I can barely afford the car I currently own due to extremely limited financial means and now I just feel like all hope is lost.

1bntxit;Looking for both support & advice. I don't know what's wrong with me.;BatOk9985;"I took about 1 month off of work for my depression. I attended therapy regularly, still not sure if I'm going to take the medication route or not (I've had previous bad experiences). I might take another month off, not sure. But I didn't accomplish as much as I had liked. I wanted to work out more and do things I enjoy. But I often found it hard to focus and lacked in time management skills. (I may have undiagnosed adhd, not 100% certain). I feel lost. I don't want to die, but I don't know what to do with myself. I have a boyfriend and still have my job. I have pets. In terms of a social life, I have friends, but I don't take time to hang out with them. I also don't have a good relationship with any of my parents/grandparents (I'm adopted by my grandparents). But I don't even know why I hate my job. It's really not too bad, it's retail, and my previous job had a lot of toxic management involved in it. But I dread going to work. But as I spent my month off, towards the end, I found it kind of boring, mostly because it's been hard for me to have any sort of discipline to have a routine and be as productive as I'd like.Taking the month off was useful in the sense of not losing my job, and not dreading going. I also was able to somewhat start a morning/night routine of actually taking care of myself, such as brushing my teeth and cleaning my face and so forth. Prior to this time period it's been difficult to manage smaller things like that.I just don't know what's wrong with me. I've tried to ""motivate"" myself in terms of maybe moving/relocating, because my bf & I plan to move out of this small shitty city and hopefully will move to a state where there's more to do & may even be closer to a family member.But until then I don't know what to do with myself or how to maintain my sanity. And really, even if we do move, who knows if I'll truly be ""happier""?I can't wrap my head around why existing is so fucking difficult for me. I don't even want to die anymore, as I had once felt before (many, many times, I've been much more severely depressed & suicidal), and yet I'm still struggling. I don't get it. Do I take another month off? Do I need medicine? Do I need a different therapist?

Last year it came to a point where I was just so burned out my doctor put me home for months to start experimenting with medication because I felt I wasn't able to continue living like this.I also got the diagnosis ADHD last year because of many issues I've faced in both my personal and professional life. They've always been there and whatever I tried to do to fix them or deal with them, they always came back in my face from people I know and people I work with.I've been trying to deal with everything for years, but half a year ago I just crashed and felt I wasn't able to continue, hence whe my doctor put me home to fix myself. It's been 5 months now since I'm at home, trying to find the right help. I've tried medication but that's not working. I have to start on new meds this week. I've been going to different psychologists since I was 16, the one I'm working with since a couple of weeks seems pretty good, but not enough.

1bnfibj;Tips for just getting shit done with depression while I look for help;Thick_Aardvark;"Hello - I'm sorry if this is kind of a repeat of previous postsI most likely have MDD (therapist diagnosed 3 years ago but I didn't believe them?)I'm a 19yo who is doing objectively fine in life(?), I go to a competitive university and great grades, I'm currently working in a good lab position, and I have a family who loves me and some really good friends, I do pretty well socially etc etc. However, I am very much not happy and have not felt happy in as long as I can remember, and frankly I'm really sick of it. I'm worried because there was one point in my life where I kind of ""lost"" to it and fucked up all my grades and it's always been (at least i think) something that ruins the majority of my relationships. I'm starting to recognize that I'm losing my grip again and it's at a reaaaallllly bad time.I went through a breakup last semester that was at least partially if not totally caused by my (and his) depression, and I think that while I've worked through that and can confidently say I'm through the weeds of ""getting over it"", life is even harder since then and I'm losing the already weak grip on life that I had before. I have also developed a semi-concerning weed habit :)Essentially, I am really struggling, and I'm going to try starting therapy later this week, but I want advice on the following points just to get through life for the next few months without fucking everything up.- Is there any way at all that I can force myself not to feel just so i can get shit done (my current strategy is drinking in immense amount of caffeine just so i can focus and then hoping that it happens even though i feel genuine despair at all times)-How can I try and manage this feeling of having a ""big secret"" with my coworkers/Supervisors? I always find myself looking to them for some sort of guidance and in turn imagining and wishing for the ability to tell them about my emotional struggles and getting comfort and support from them (i know it's weird but idk if this is a universal thing). I know the bounds of a professional relationship and don't think I would ever cross them or try and tell them anything about this, but I find myself taking things way too personally as a result.-I want a genuine answer on whether or not it's very very concerning that I smoke almost every evening - I think my usual feeling behind the choice is either preventative (I don't want to feel like shit tonight I just want to be able to sleep and make it to the next day) or just because I genuinely want some sort of flavor or happiness in my evening.-and also just any general life tips on how to deal with this and how to get the most out of therapy.thank you";Hello - I'm sorry if this is kind of a repeat of previous postsI most likely have MDD (therapist dia;REQUESTING ADVICE;2;2;2024-03-25 14:47:55;2024-03-25;Monday;14:47:55;2665;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:48.094034
1bna93i;Struggling.. ;-_Phoenix__-;My partner and I have encountered yet another obstacle in our relationship recently. I'm struggling, but I'm hesitant to let him know because I feel he's indifferent. We had a discussion within the last 24 hours, and I already sense it's over. Although he mentioned discussing things further tonight, he hasn't reached out since this morning. I'm at a loss for words and emotions. I apologized for my behavior but emphasized that it's not something I can easily change, considering how much I've already changed. Our relationship had a tumultuous start, and he admits he no longer sees me the same way. Despite our efforts to improve, things have deteriorated again in the past few weeks. We argue frequently, and he becomes excessively angry over trivial matters, simply because he disagrees with my perspective. It's impossible to constantly tiptoe around his sensitivities throughout our relationship.I'm torn between not wanting to lose him, our home, and our life together, and feeling utterly exhausted and depressed. I wish he were willing to change, as he claims he is trying, but his actions make it hard to believe. If he truly wanted to be with me, he wouldn't give up so easily. He insists he doesn't want to lose what we have, but it feels like it's already over.I've decided to seek therapy again, with my first appointment scheduled for tomorrow. However, I feel lost and unsure of what to do next. It's as if I'm on the verge of losing everything—him, the home we bought together, and my entire life. Meanwhile, he seems unfazed and indifferent, poised to retain everything while I'm left discarded. I'm battling with myself, questioning why I continue to endure this struggle. Sometimes, I wonder if it's even worth it anymore.;My partner and I have encountered yet another obstacle in our relationship recently.

Coming home at 7pm to only have 3hrs left until I had to sleep to do it all over again the next day for 5 days a week. On the weekend I would dread Monday so much that I would end up crying.

I wanted to end it all 3 years ago (too weak to even do that) when I dropped out of high school due to pressure and depression, spent few years making friends and watched as life took them all away, cant even get a career going or even keep a dead end job, I don't even talk to my own family anymore, no chance of even getting a significant other.

1bmrfqf;Some advice on how to take care of someone with depression?;pokours;So, I'm personally fine. Well, as good as I can be, but it's not really the issue here. My uncle is apparently severly depressed. I really know the details except that it's been going on for a few months but it seemed to have been getting worse lately. Yesterday, he was hospitalized and got medication that tend to make him sleep a lot. Currently I'm in between jobs, so my dad talked it with my aunt (uncle's wife), and they agreed he should stay with us (I live with my dad), for a few days, as they don't want to leave him alone during the day. I'll be home with him pretty much all the time, and usually I mind my own business in my room, but I'll do what I need to do. Except I.. don't really know what to do. I'm no therapist or any kind of health professional, so I won't pretend I'm going to help him out of it, my goal is simply to make sure he's fine for the time. I assume he's going to be sleeping a lot, and I can't just stay right next to him all the time either anyway (I may be home all day, I still have stuff to do). So.. any advice? Practically speaking, how often should I check on him? Should I try to wake him up sometimes? Should I make sure he eats well or leave him be if he says he's not hungry?

(I speak 3 diff languge so it wont be my first to learn)Went to VHS but been faced with people been agressive and the teachers couldnt handle them. Done online courses but my level is at A2 still.Regularly receiving messages on LinkedIn for mid senior ,senior positions (my linkedin shows that i only speak on a basic level) as soon as they get to know that im not german/not speaking german they are out. This got me to a place when i cant move for days and days out of bed other than eat and shower. Im froze and smallest task takes all my energy.While my surroundings (friends and partner(we dont live together) dont notice this as i dont wanna bring them down they dont know that i got to a point where im thinking of just quitting life...Ive been hustling for 10 years - university 2 degree in a diff country on a diff language other than my mother tongue, been in relationships but thinking back as long as i helped them or was good for st they were around then when i raised some concerns and left them they got ugly (by behavior-wise). Moved around europe purely for work and thats how i was able to finance my life which ive done from day 1, cleaning then uni then bartending etc. Got scholarships as well.But here in Germany (Southern) I feel that unless i speak german i would never be able to settle. (Im currently back in full time german studying and with the little money i have im visiting a private teacher).All positions requires c1 german which to be honest i think the pc way to put that they want a german as ive heard from friends that even with c1 german they were still rejected(ofc it could be st else but it happened to many times with them).Would it be possible to learn in a year up to C1 ? Or ? Im hiding behind my smile and try not to think too much about. But here i am and havent been in my comfort zone in the last 10 y, grinding like hell and still dont see at least a great improvement in my life but working and saving and then unemployed and start from 0 again...Im Sick of moving, im here I wanna make this work with my partner learn the language but so many disturbing thoughts i have , if i should just give up...#;Edit: HR field (F/30) Ive lost my job recently, with many others.

I grew up as an immigrant child in Europe, got bullied hard, if I look back on it I don't really hate my bullies but they have taken a toll on my self esteem ever since middle school. I went through lots of weird patches and patterns in my life which seem to zig-zag back and forth: I seem to be capable of having a healthy and optimistic outlook in life, I mostly 'get up' very easily if I ever happen to 'fall down' mentally or emotionally because I hate victimising myself or being a burden to the people around me, and I give amazing advice to my friends which I cannot seem to apply to myself. But sometimes I still go in such dark places that I can even scare myself, some really bad depressive episodes and anxiety attacks have come and gone to me ever since I can remember. Rn I am experiencing some bad anxiety which I hadn't felt in a long time and I cannot really explain it...I have a stable (although challenging and stressful) job, I work as a teacher and anything about working with kids is not as simple as it sounds, I have an amazing husband who worries about me, I am getting an MA degree and although it's stressful it is nothing that I know I cannot handle (academic achievement has been kind of a refuge for me all my life), we are also planning to renovate our entire house (with baby steps I am sure that it will work out)...But still my brain chemistry feels all wonky, sometimes I get triggers, other times there is no warning at all and I go back to my dark place (depressive thoughts, oftentimes sucdal - not in the sense that I would hurt myself, since that would hurt my husband and my family, but in the sense that 'what if I died in my sleep tonight, what if that truck ran my car over rn?' kind of bullsit - I go from having a high self esteem and prasing myself to feeling like the chewing gum under someone's shoe in a matter of days, I get huge urges to go back to my addictions (I have a history of heavy teenage drinking and on and off smoking, which my husband hates since his fav grandpa has died of), etc.This pattern is really messing with me and as I said, my husband is starting to notice things...I don't speak about my emotions, depression and anxiety have always been a taboo in my family, my immigrant parents usually had to worry about the clothes they put on their children's back and the food they put on the table, mental health is still kind of a myth to them...So speaking aloud about my feelings gives me a huge lump in my throat and I feel like crying instantly, which I prefer to do under the shower where nobody can hear me...The idea of therapy also scares me, I have a bit of a trauma which I will not go into detail about with anything doctors/shrinks/hospitals since my teenage years.Has anyone gone through anything like this?

1bmc2qi;La dépression;Official_FBK;Titre: Comprendre la dépression: conseils et soutien pour ceux qui en souffrentSalut à tous,Je voulais prendre un moment pour parler de quelque chose qui me tient vraiment à cœur: la dépression. C'est un sujet difficile à aborder, mais il est tellement important de briser le silence et d'offrir du soutien à ceux qui en ont besoin.La dépression peut toucher n'importe qui, peu importe son âge, son sexe ou sa situation sociale. Elle ne se limite pas à se sentir un peu triste de temps en temps, mais peut entraîner une détresse émotionnelle profonde et durable.Si vous ou quelqu'un que vous connaissez souffrez de dépression, sachez que vous n'êtes pas seul. Il existe de l'aide et du soutien disponibles. Voici quelques conseils et ressources qui pourraient vous être utiles:1. Parlez-en: Il est crucial de parler de ce que vous ressentez.

Cherchez de l'aide professionnelle: Les thérapeutes, les psychologues et les psychiatres sont là pour vous aider.

1bma9gp;I'm fading away because of her.;Pretend-Scarcity-593;"Hello I am a 17 year old male and I want your support like nothing else. One and a half weeks before I started talking through text with a really beautiful girl. From the first day something just clicked and I thought she was the one. She showed signs as well. We both loved rap and Formula 1. We were talking all day without stopping and while talking with her I was the happiest man on the planet. I got the courage on the 4th or 5th day to ask her out on a date and she happily accepted. We were both looking forward to it and we were talking about how much fun we were going to have. 4 days ago though was the day that I would receive a devastating message. I sent her a message like we were normally doing and her responses were ice cold and it was like a different person was texting me and after a while I received the message that would cause the downward spiral of my mental health. She cancelled the date because she would be out of town. I obviously understood the situation and I told her when she feels that she can reschedule to message me so i can arrange my program. At first, I thought it was a test and I left her be for the next few days. 2 days ago I sent her a message to catch up to her on how's she's doing the last few days. Without even answering my question she told me that she has a boyfriend and she ""apologized for such sudden news"". I was shocked. The first few hours I had my tough guy suit on and acted like I didn't care at all. Little did I know that I cared a lot last night I was listening to depressing songs and I was crying like crazy at some point my face got numb. Needless to say that I feel sick and ready for a tough battle with depression I also put my lips on alcohol while hanging out with my best friend. I've never done this for a girl before. I'm absolute broken. I still have 1% faith that one day in the next few months (that's how long teen relationships last)she will come back because I never did her any wrong and send me a message. Right now I'm feeling sick as I write this. Please people give me some support responses I'm in pieces.";Hello I am a 17 year old male and I want your support like nothing else.

1bm821d;me and my family are in deep trouble. ;PorteANDchair;"so in summary I made a montage of a friend of mine who works in a ""very illegal"" organization and it didn't go as planned at all. basically we have fun sending photos of ourselves and our friends' faces in photos to make fun of them just for fun but this time I made a very very funny montage of his face but it didn't take it as a joke. he threatened my entire family privately on Instagram including me and gave the task to one of his subordinates to kill me. and the worst thing is that he already had my address and I already know what he is capable of and I know very well that if he wants to kill someone he will do it. I asked everyone to delete the photos to avoid having problems, I deleted them too I sent all the videos of me and my colleagues who deleted the photos from our galleries. I spoke with one of the members of the organization and he helped me get out of this shit. I was very scared but thanks to him I was able to escape and save my family. for now he said that he and I are even so for now I'm relieved to know that there won't be too many problems. I'm still very afraid that one day they will come to harm my family and me and I really need help so if anyone can help me that would be super cool. I didn't introduce myself, my name is Samuel, I'm 16 years old and I'm studying in a high school. throughout the whole argument I really didn't feel good I was very scared and was about to cry and I'm afraid that one day he might decide to hurt me or my family. this person knows my Instagram and my discord what should I do? delete my insta and my discord knowing that he has my location? I'm French and I translated all this text via Google Translate because I was really too scared to write everything by hand so if my text is hard to read sorry.

Ofc its good to have a reason not to ""yknow"", but the problem is that things like going to school, feels unnecessary and pointless or even do anything at all.

I come home on weekends and I pack it with helping friends and family as much as possible anything to keep me busy. just for number probably 20+ hours on the weekend. So on average 70+ hours and the + varies. But this weekend I am not doing anything so I am just lying on the couch doing nothing. But just feel sad, don’t want to move, kinda wanna cry but don’t know why. There is nothing wrong with my life. I have a steady job, make and save decent money, have dreams and goals, a beautiful girlfriend that loves me and would do anything for me. Almost forgot my best friend. My 6 year old German shepherd named Loki. But back to the point. When I am alone I just hate myself and life for absolutely no reason. And I would love some personal experience and help i hate running from myself. And I am going to say this and mean this I will never kill my self I promise so people that are worried about that don’t be I understand myself enough to seek professional help if I ever got that bad. I hate shrinks due to shitty child ones and have a few family members that are one so I hate that traditional approach but would love some personal experience and how you were able to get past this.

I also compare myself to others whoever they are form my friends to everyone in every details small to small. I am very reserved . I also think I am a narcissist .I also don't feel any emotions for anybody. I don't have any creativity in me thats why I can't make conversations make jokes laugh with people make memories . I feel to anxious when I public and can't talk to people and I can't make an eyecontact with people. I just am unable to behave normally. I don't have any friends . I am just becoming more toxic day by day. I also have a problem of perfections that why I think I never did anything in my life , never did anything completely. God has given me no good except more bad. I am too logical. I always procrastinate things. I am too adult for my age and in a bad way(I am not mature like others but kind of old ) . I am too concious of myself and when I make some mistake I immediately start seeing around me if somebody notices me and as I have turned 18 I can see many changes happening in me as a result I am no longer innocent like others like whenever something bad happens around me I am become too much aware of it and it feels very bad while others don't even notice it and remain happy like I used to be before in childhood. Also I don't like sports like others. I have too much dark interests unlike everyone else. Sometimes I think all this is due to me being born in 16 December which is the worse date of the year as I have seen people born in December are worse people neither they look good nor they have talents. I know I may sound stupid here but all this one of my dark interests which I have wasted my life observing.   Why God made me like this . I want to be those normal people who I see everytime make jokes happily going outside doing fun things with each other. I am too different from others. Also I have problems with doing daily chores but nobody has this problem. Sometime I think should I make a baby in my future as he will also suffer like me . I want to die .I did nothing good in my life nothing memorable . Whenever I am in a group I am always seen as very different while others belnd themselves in the group. I am always outcasted. Also seeing too much Google making theories about my insecurities made my life, my mind a hell . Nothing exiteds me now . Nothing feels the same .

1blt5g1;I feel like I’m going to die alone in the country I live in.;BubblyInevitable2260;I live in a holiday town and everyone comes and goes that it’s so depressing to live in Benidorm when you’re single, but it feels like there’s no one here for me that lives here and I don’t like the guys that live here in this country either. I don’t want to date someone that lives in a different country unless I get so desperate that I have no choice because them guys seem to be so much better and nicer and I would love to date them if I didn’t live in this dead end country. I’m starting to hate living in here because it causes me that much misery to simply meet someone. My family moved me to Spain and now I’m trapped here trying to make a life for myself here, when it feels like there’s nothing in this country happening that I’m living a non existent life here that there’s nothing else do to but go the bars and get drunk or go to the beach which you like to do on holiday but to live doing that makes me feel like I’m trapped a holiday I hate being on forever wondering if I’ll ever get home except waste my life away in the sun. It’s depressing living in a country where I can’t meet anyone and I have the language barrier feeling like I’m forced to learn the language just to meet someone when it shouldn’t be like that when I don’t have that problem back home that I can rarely find anyone that speaks English that lives here or they are taken or they don’t like me back, unlike being back in my home country I can meet anyone that actually speaks my language that there’s something about home countries that have everything for you and I fucking miss that now living in a dead country with no opportunities for me. It hurts to think I would of been much better off staying in England that everyone I know there has a family of their own and I would of been like them now but instead, im trapped overseas having a miserable life being away from home because I can’t afford to move and with there being loads of opportunities to meet people there it hurts to see that I’m really missing out. Wow I really miss England as the weather isn’t everything and Spain is only for families and couples not looking to find love there and if you’re single do not move to Spain as you will be single forever there unless you want to be alone forever or learn the language which I don’t want to when I don’t want to be here, I can’t afford to move back to my home country. I’m breaking down, thinking I will never meet anyone if I stay here but it stings thinking I don’t have a choice that it’s life and death for me to find someone here. I go out all the time here just to fucking meet holiday makers and everyone on the dating apps is a weirdo here that I miss the pleasure of simply meeting with locals back in England with there being a lot of people there for everyone and not just put with a certain type of guy feeling like I have no choice here.

How i achieve it?)  - still drink coffee, drink coffee if you like it, as long you stop 6 hours before bed  but total abstinence from alcohol, its terrible (caffeine is great)  - Purpose  make a plan for yourself, work towards it everyday  good for me: financial freedom, helping others ...  (What you really want boiled down to a simple function, how do i achieve this function?)   Strive for something good, good for you and others, dont just work aimlessly and wonder why your life is going nowhere   avoiding crash triggers (big meals, showers etc., shit sleep)     GOOD SLEEP!!!!;Hey   i lurked here for years and noticed i never came back, noticing finally i am not really depres;PROVIDING SUPPORT;15;0;2024-03-23 10:04:47;2024-03-23;Saturday;10:04:47;1374;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:48.141415

1blmkgo;Can someone help me with my problem?;Gondal90;"My problem is that people generally seem to dislike me. My attempts at making friends almost always fail. I'd say 99% of the time they fail. Usually, some people do seem to care a lot for a while; they make promises to always be friends with me, and then they just gradually lose interest until, eventually, they just completely break contact and ghost me. After that, they act like I'm some worthless sub-human garbage and act like they never knew me. It is very painful. I tend to get ghosted a lot. Not only that, but people also seem to mistreat me often. I get insulted, ignored, and treated with a cold attitude. At this point, I don't think I can fix this on my own. I've tried on my own to fix it but to no avail, so at this point, I think I need someone else to help me fix this. I can't get professional help at this time, so I am looking for someone here who can help me fix this problem. I will be very grateful.

1bl4qq2;some motivation: I just had my first skateboard excursion (at age 39!);CyberbulliedByAdmin;"so I'm 39 and diagnosed as severely depressed. two serious attempts to end my life, and serious thoughts daily.last year, I bought an electric skateboard to use when travelling (I live in a camper van; I don't like bikes and scooters are too heavy), specifically to get around city centres.except the board I got was not electric, it was a simple, cheap penny board that sells for 10 quid. the seller (some liquidation operation, I guess) was super nice and returned my payment in full, despite me offering to keep the board for said 10 quid. and she let me keep the board for free.so I fooled around with it on a few parking lots since. I had never been on a skateboard before, and a youth background in skiing and skating did not feel helpful at first with a medium that doesn't stick to you, and only is ONE board.anyway, I made progress.so today, I decided to park the van out in front of the city, and to skate the 2-3km into the centre. my first ""proper"" skating excursion.it went well!with all limbs still intact, I returned home, suddenly spotting a situation getting tight: two people in front of me, facing away. two more people coming the other way, deeply in conversation. a cyclist coming the other way, weaving between them. a slight slope, my board accelerating.what do I do? trust my skills, and the positive experiences of the last 5km? or jump off, into the grass? everyone I had encountered today had been very courteous; nobody had taken offence by someone skating (considerately), even on narrow paths. I decided therefore not to push it on the last 100m - and to jump off.that worked well.I fished my board out of the very wet grass and walked the last metres to the van, when a young woman said ""nicely saved! that looked cool!"" I was slightly embarrassed for being thoroughly sweaty, but beaming from such a lovely compliment....old cats new tricks and all. I'm not a ""sporty"" person by inclination, and yet I'm really happy I followed that weirdly coincidental impulse to take up skateboarding. this is my weirdly specific anecdote, but if you're reading this and are hesitant about doing something - as they say: gopher it!<3 lots of love";so I'm 39 and diagnosed as severely depressed. two serious attempts to end my life, and serious thou;MOTIVATION;2;2;2024-03-22 17:22:41;2024-03-22;Friday;17:22:41;2164;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:49.757360

It's not graphic, I assure you.--/Seven months ago, I tried to kill myself.In the immediate aftermath, I was relieved to be alive, but soon regressed back to suicidality.I then decided that I would fight to live on for the sake of those who cared for me, but with no intrinsic desire to remain alive.Now, finally, after all this time, I can say that I want to stay for this show -- for my own self.And suddenly, there's a whole bunch of things happening. I'm getting intrusive images which are both memories and visions of my death. I instinctively wince at these before I realise what has happened. My heartbeat goes supersonic and my face becomes as hot as a summer day. I even lose my balance sometimes.Emotionally, there's multiple issues:1. There was a significant duration in which I thought that I was going to die and that no amount of medical help could change that. Just experiencing that has changed me.2. Physiologically speaking, I don't know how I am alive. I'm not being dramatic here. I didn't gently approach the line between life and death and then back off. I ran full speed towards that line, too fast to stop. And yet, here I am.3. When I think of what would have happened after I had died, if I had died, my eyes must up. I feel guilty, utterly guilty, when I think of what mum, dad, sis, and friends would have had to go through if I had died. Including the discovery of the body, the last rites... And their grief. Their self blame. My throat's going all chokey as I type this.4. I'm terrified that my demons will return to finish what they started. There's nothing too substantial keeping the lid on them.So, yeah. All this is swirling in my heart.I know I need a trauma therapist, but apart from that.... What do I do? How do I forgive myself?

1bkqxz8;What is my purpose ;;I'm 25 and have been suffering from depression my whole life. Over the years I've had many opportunities where I thought things would get better for me, but somehow I always find a way to fuck it up. All my friends moved away, my dad left me when I was four, and the person I have romantic feelings for doesn't want anything to do with me. This is just scratching the service, there are so many things wrong with my life that it be pointless to try and explain. I'm scared of growing old, it hurts seeing the people I love go away. I just want to be happy but no matter how hard I try I always end up in the same situation. Poor, alone, and miserable beyond comprehension. My family ain't much help either, they know how bad things for. All they do is just tell me everything is going to be ok, without actually doing to help. Not that could help me even if they wanted to.

1bklq6b;I can’t get over my ex after she u*live herself;Effective_Trainer330;Just like the tittle says im having the worst time of my life for the last 2years mentally. I 24M Ex19 were engage and due circumstances on both sides things did not go as planned, now a year after we went our separate ways we started talking back again in friends way manner and everything seemed fine, but right after 2weeks of talking again I receive the call of her passing by our mutual best friend in common. I tried my best to contact with her cause I didn’t wanna believe it. But until families and friends started uploading their photos together with her it’s when all hit me hard, I’m talking about being in bed for 2weeks cause I lost my appetite and was just beating myself into believing that it was my fault cause I was the who broke our not contact, but I just missed her for whole year and even tho we were engaged and that we broke up, she was my very first best friend that I had in another country. Now the thing is since we were just talking to each other her family did not wanted to see me or know anything of me for whatever reason and it felt like I couldn’t say my good byes to her. But ever since that happen every year around the time of that “anniversary” cause I don’t know how to call it everything with me seems off like I don’t laugh like I usually do, I lost all my will and power to grieve a girl who I couldn’t even say a proper goodbye over 2years ago. I’m still sensitive about the topic but I feel so powerless to do anything about it, I miss her, I loved her but I just want God to give me my best friend back, undoubtedly she was the love of my life but I feel that what I felt with her won’t even happen again in this life, I have so many regrets and I don’t know what to do with these thoughts.

1bklh6l;What If I Don't Have It In Me To Get Better? ;DreamerOfTheDawn888;"Would really love and appreciate your thoughts & insights please 🙏...I feel like I suffer from Depression (MDD) and suicidality. It's been 10+ years like this with ebbs and flows here and there but it's gotten worse imo the past 5+ months. I feel deep down that I don't have it in me to get better 😢 like, I don't feel deep down that I have the strength physically, emotionally and mentally.For the past few months I think I tried to take solace in the idea and thought that hopefully therapy will help. At least hope for it. But then recently I really started having thoughts & feelings of...what's the point? 💔 no matter what or who you go to...it seems like at the end of the day it's really up to you to make that difference. But I don't feel like I have it in me to get better. And, that's made me feel more depressed imo. Like, as sad as it sounds I had this thought of that...it's cheaper to just...not be, instead of suffering through it and trying to get out of abuse for example. I was lucky enough to recieve a therapy call session recently and the although the lady therapist was really sharp & professional and lovely - she was also imo really blunt with me and stated very bluntly that ""you have to fight for your life"". But again...what if I don't have it in me anymore? Again I am very grateful for the call session but feel sad deep down about all this.Whatever it is that's missing feels deeper than just drive and motivation. I don't know what it is though but everyone seems to have it and I don't feel it in me anymore...It doesn't help that I live in an abusive situation that I cannot get out of.

1bkg07r;Help, I Don't Feel Like Anyone Cares;;"HiFor context, I am a 21 year old guy. I'm pretty introverted and mostly like to keep to myself, both due to it simply being an aspect of my personality as well as a fairly significant bit of trauma.I used to have such big dreams of becoming a scientist and making the world a better place. My interest was in physics and I went to college for a while before I just totally crashed. A fairly significant aspect of my trauma is related to homophobia - being queer in the Deep South is brutal as hell. Everything just kinda got to me over the span of a couple of months and I totally lost my drive. That, and the sheer expense of college was absolutely absurd. I wasn't willing to go into that kind of debt, even if everyone else was.I went back home to my parents, and I've been here for almost two years now. I dont have the energy to keep a job, and I mostly just try to live for what little moments of happiness I happen to stumble upon. I have very few friends, mostly for logistical reasons (leaving college and... well people being who they are around here). My trauma is still very much present despite my life being more devoid of external stressors than it ever has been, albeit I am much more relaxed and comfortable.I guess more than anything I'm just lonely. I dont really get along with my family and rarely see them even though we live together. We dont exactly hold... compatible views... I didnt really keep any of my friends from high school either, as I realized they weren't the best of people as I matured.I've tried therapy a few times before but it didnt really help, likely due to the nature of folks around here. I was once in a conversation with someone who supposedly came highly recommended around here, and I happened to touch on my OCD. I told her that I had really awful intrusive thoughts regarding the nature of my morality and desires (something like that) and she responded with ""are you afraid you're a homosexual?"" Fuck man.Sometimes I simply wish I could just fade into nothingness. I dont feel like anyone really cares about me, but at the same point I realize me uh... 'exiting the game' would really hurt people and I dont want to do that. I dont really know what I'm expecting by posting this here, I guess I hope for some kind of help but more than anything I guess I just kind of wanted to express the magnitude of my loneliness and anguish.But yeah I guess thats about it... thanks for reading.

1bkcr71;tomorrow's my F20 birthday, and I'm just feeling miserable. And I feel like im slowly loosing myself again;Inner-Pie-1892;So, tomorrow's my F20 birthday, and I'm just feeling miserable. Let me walk you through why...Back in grade 5, birthdays were fun. But since then, they've been kind of a letdown. Last year, my boyfriend M20 blocked me because he thought I was feeling suicidal because of him. That really hurt. The year before that, I was just hanging out with a guy I was seeing, nothing special. And the year before that, I was begging my ex to come see me, even bought myself a cake because he couldn't be bothered.Then there was the lockdown year, where everything was just... meh. And before that, I found out a guy I liked was just using me. Now, this year, my boyfriend was trying to make it special, but I ended up ruining it by being all sad. And now he's upset too, which just adds to my misery. He even suggested I block him, which feels like another blow.I'm losing interest in everything. Food makes me nauseous, I can't sleep, and my heart feels like it's going to explode. I've stopped going to the gym and doing my work. I can't even find joy in binge-watching shows.I need advice. How do I break out of this cycle of disappointment and sadness? How do I make my birthday, and life in general, feel meaningful again? Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.Update:  To add to the mix, one of my close friends reached out to me. She's having a terrible stomach ache and needs to go to the gynecologist tomorrow. She doesn't want to go alone and asked if I could accompany her.Here's the thing: I'm really not in the right mindset to be there for her tomorrow. I'm overwhelmed with my own emotions and struggles, and the thought of being there for someone else feels like too much to handle. But I also don't want to let my friend down when she needs support.So next day out of guilt of not being there for my friend when they needed and being a terrible friend I stepped out and It turned out that my friends, including my boyfriend, had a lil surprise planned for my birthday. I was overwhelmed when I walked into the room and grateful for their efforts, but also felt a bit frustrated that they used a prank involving a gynecologist visit to get me there. Despite my efforts to reciprocate the energy and enjoy the moment, I found myself drained ( I did not let them feel like I felt this way). I danced and tried eating, but as soon as I stepped out, I felt even worse. Since then, I've been bedridden and struggled to be productive the next day.;So, tomorrow's my F20 birthday, and I'm just feeling miserable.

After about a hour I asked her to please don't send me the diaper and everyone said they all got diapers after she said she does it to everyone who cries, whines or bitches. So I sat there just being this joke for around 2 hours just crying my eyes out because I'm to emotional to keep my own emotions separate.  This all started because I bought a bag she fills with junk and a pen, I bought during the time she was doing them but she didn't see I made the purchase. And I asked her if she got mine or seen I bought it. And she made fun of the fact that she made me a nervous bag and called it the bag I purchased after. I knew she was wrong, I know she will notice after but I apologized for asking her and that's when it all started. Now I just feel like a emotional wreck like I have so many problems. 😩  I just want to be normal again.

1bk1xel;Problems with Overeating;CreeperXteo;"So, this one has a bit of a story. I recently lost over 50 lbs from being 250, over a period of about 5 months from changes to my daily life. I rid my bike more, ate less (due to stress) and felt good about myself. Recently in December, I suddenly lost a lot of momentum of my life entirely. My grades in college started to slip, and I was driving more to school so that made me gain weight. That isn't the big part though. Recently, I have been staying up later, sometimes to 4/5 AM. Sometimes I would drive to school at around midnight and park, and just sleep in the car. I consistently eat fast food definitely over 7 times a week, and I also occasionally go and get 2 tubs of ice cream (the 1/5 Quart ones) and eat one in one go in the morning, and one in the evening, on my days off from school. Then most likely I get hungry again and go out at like 1 in the morning and do a fast food run somewhere close. Rare occasions I ""treat"" myself to about a dozen or more donuts too and shave those off in about a day. I've gained the 50 pounds back in just a couple months. I was wondering what steps I could take besides ""just eat better"" to support weight loss. If you need more background to the story I'm happy to fill it in.";So, this one has a bit of a story.

My dad had a huge fight with his brothers because they wanted to abandon my grandfather. That's when we took full responsibility of my grandfather and moved to another city. My dad had a joint business with one of his brothers which he wrapped up and decided to retire and start something small in another city. However, due to a closed market, he was unable to start anything new and thus, decided to retire completely.That's when we all took the decision to open a pop-up store for my mom as she used to work from home (her business is about gifting and packing). In a gist, my mom got super busy with the work and dad got super free. Me and my brother moved out of home for our jobs in other cities. It's been 3 years since our family moved to the new city but my dad is still stuck on his relationship with his brothers (who don't give any fk about us). He still misses his business too. Me, my brother, my mom- we all have tried to come up with different business ideas that my dad could start but he doesn't want to spend money into something that might fail. We have also suggested him to join some clubs, sports academy or even see a doctor if he is not feeling well mentally, but he refuses to do anything. He is in the state where he just sits on the bed the whole day doing nothing, being sad. In the last few weeks, he has stopped talking much, too. He has started sleeping for prolonged hours and doesn't tend to house chores or try to look for any activities for himself at all.We even suggested him to try out Vipassana (it's a meditation activity which helps one relax their mind and look at things from a broader perspective). But he just keeps saying that even if he joins anything, in the end he would have to come back home to being idle again. We are all super worried on how to help him unless he is willing to help himself. We have run out of ideas on how we can make him busy again.Has anyone else ever been in such a situation? How can we help a person having a depressive state of mind who doesn't want to be helped at all? TL;DR- My family moved to another city 3 years back after my dad had a huge fight with his brothers who wanted to abandon my grandfather.

1bjz2mn;Please help;alcapattos;"Hello everyone.I have quite an interesting situation, and although I know this isn't the most suitable place to find answers or solutions, still it's possible that some response might help me enormously, more than you can imagine.I'm a 22-year-old guy, living alone. For over 8 years, I've been periodically experiencing depressive episodes lasting from 3 to 14 months with varying severity.I've seen many specialists, specifically 4 who evaluated me, diagnosed me with moderate to severe depression, and offered various methods of medication treatment (SSRIs/SNRIs/tricyclic antidepressants), which I strictly followed for extended periods (4-5 months) but proved to be totally ineffective.Usually, these episodes creep in so gradually that you don't even notice how one day you wake up totally devoid of energy and will. And similarly gradually, they recede.I find myself now at a point where I'm struggling greatly to write these lines because I feel totally drained of any mental strength, my thoughts are sluggish and forced, and I struggle to articulate what exactly is happening to me.I would appreciate it if someone who has some idea of what I might be suffering from could at least offer a guess, their own hypothesis, because I feel like I'm treading water, following the same paths to resolve my situation.I say ""guesses"" because I'm not even convinced myself that I suffer from depression, but that's what the ""specialists"" have told me.If you ask me why I don't go to a psychologist or psychiatrist, I'll tell you that I'm totally broke, living off some savings, and I haven't been working for 2 weeks now, I can't find the strength. On the other hand, I've been to specialists before and it all boils down again to the same pills that don't show their effect and make me even more lifeless.I'll list the symptoms I'm experiencing:- Constant physical fatigue- Mental fatigue (everything requires forced effort, the same activities meant to bring you pleasure seem torturous)- My working memory has dropped drastically, as has my long-term memory. The information in my head seems hard to access and hard to retrieve; I can spend 10 minutes trying to remember what I did 5 hours ago.- My thinking seems super slow and forced, my automatic thoughts have disappeared, or free associations. Sometimes I notice that my head is empty, devoid of thoughts; in general, I feel like I'm a retarded degenerate.- I find practically no pleasure in anything- I have a constant feeling of frustration as if it's too cold, too hot, or too tired, meaning I can't even properly enjoy rest or feel it.- From the range of emotions, only anger remains, which gives me a mental energy boost to combat apathy and not be crushed by the situation.That being said, you would do me an immeasurable favor if you could give me some advice on what I might be suffering from and what I could do in this situation.If you want to recommend lifestyle advice, know that I strictly adhere to:8 hours of sleep, I take cold showers 1-2 times a day, I do at least 3 hours of physical activity per day (even if I don't feel like it), I don't consume alcohol or other nonsense, and I try to eat because I don't really have an appetite.I have no relatives except for a brother who is living in another country.Thank you for reading this far, and I await a response from whoever can provide one.";Hello everyone.I have quite an interesting situation, and although I know this isn't the most suitab;REQUESTING ADVICE;3;3;2024-03-21 05:24:12;2024-03-21;Thursday;05:24:12;3366;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:49.805883
1bjxrtp;advice for getting through periods of loneliness?;Medical-Crow3238;hi all,i've been depressed for a few years now and right now i'm experiencing a particularly rough patch. i'm trans and attending a small college in a small rural town with basically all people who don't especially like trans people. i have found 1 friend who is mostly supportive but he's pretty busy and i don't want to be overly dependent on him as codependency has been a problem for me in the past. my family lives far away and isn't very supportive of me. i'm a senior next year, and i can only afford to go to college at all because of this college's really good financial aid, so i need to ride it out and finish my degree. so, any advice for dealing with really overwhelming loneliness? i can't exactly go out and make more friends or socialize due to the area i'm in, so i'm looking for ways i can deal with it ideally mostly on my own. even if it's not long-term solutions, i really just need to get through the next year without ending up in the psych ward again. i'm in therapy and on meds that both seem to be working outside of this issue, i just feel like i've hit a rock wall in my life and i don't want to have to sit around waiting until halfway through 2025 to stop feeling so completely alone on the planet. thanks for reading;hi all,i've been depressed for a few years now and right now i'm experiencing a particularly rough p;REQUESTING ADVICE;3;2;2024-03-21 04:07:08;2024-03-21;Thursday;04:07:08;1247;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:49.807027

I'm 16, I'm a guy, everyone treated me badly as a child, I almost had no friends, my father beat me, my mother screamed all the time, but she still treated me well, I almost committed suicide once, I almost had no friends, he always swore at everyone and at me they bullied me, I had girlfriends, but at one point I met a beautiful girl, she's perfect, we've been dating for almost 2 years, during the period of our relationship I often made mistakes, different ones. But recently I started having problems. In general. At one point, I began to have strange thoughts, they are about past partners and just abusers, thoughts of a different nature, maybe something sexual, my mind will imagine something like this, at such moments I tell myself ""Enough is enough"" And thoughts calm down completely, but okay, they were not so frequent before, now they constantly pop up and it's hard to deal with them, I have a girlfriendI love her, but because of these thoughts, I feel guilty, I feel bad.

1bjhj2r;I’m in a rut. Need to vent and advice;bobmcbobface9;Hey everyone, Im just a bit overwhelmed and I’m not sure what to do. Ever since I was a teen I struggled with anxiety depression and ADHD. My dad was horrible and the just push through it type. mental health is a myth to him. at 18 I was kicked out and I’ve been supporting myself ever since. Fast forward to 2020 it’s the middle of summer where there is all this political turmoil and COVID. I was renting a room in someone’s house. The house ended up flooding. Because I didn’t have a written lease agreement I had to find a place in 5 days that’s how long my landlord put me in a hotel for. I called my dad and explained the situation and asked if I could stay with him while I look for an apartment, but he said no. Thus really hurt and I went no contact after. Fortunately my sister let me stay with her until I found a place and moved in with my fiancé at the time. I live near Phx and rent is really expensive. My fiancé and I got an apartment but when they raised our rent we couldn’t really afford it. My in laws found a complex that was cheaper. Because of the market they pressured us to put money down on it and move in without checking it out. Worst mistake of my life. It had roaches mold and all sorts of problems. Meanwhile my sister in law who was living at home rent free would constantly tell us we smell and comment on the roaches. My fiancé and I were engaged for three years so we could save for a wedding. My fiancé and I were going to pay for most of it. My sister in law meets this guy they get engaged 4 moths before we get married. And it seems like my in laws just cared more about the other wedding. They payed for the whole thing. So it was like they got married in a castle and we got married in a barn. Sorry for the rant but it’s just so frustrating. It makes me really sad and I don’t know what to do, I’m just so resentful of my in-laws I’m in a bout of depression and hearing that my SIL just bought a house really makes me feel like shit  I love my wife but being around my in-laws makes me want to delete myself. I’m in therapy and on meds so I’m safe I’m just having a hard time.

1bje6wa;Birthday depression???;Lilacschnapps;I’m 21 (F) and today isn’t even my birthday. But sometimes I just find something that reminds me of my birthday (today it was a calendar which is ridiculous) and immediately start crying uncontrollably. My birthdays have been depressing for as far as I can remember. I’m from Thailand and my parents chose to have me born on 5th of December which is a national holiday. To be more specific, it’s the old King’s birthday which doubles as father’s day and is a big deal in this country. Everyone has to stay home and celebrate with their own families which is why I’ve never had a birthday party with friends. And though you might think that being born on an important day must make it easier for people to remember my birthday, I feel like a lot of people simply forget because there’s a lot going on on that day. But I also recognize that I must have partly been the cause of my birthday loneliness too. I’m pretty quiet. While two or three of my friends always text me happy birthday, it’s not strange for others to forget since I don’t even dare post about my birthday on social media so there’s no reminder whatsoever. Yet I always have high expectations and end up hurting my own feelings all the time. I mostly don’t get gifts or surprises of any sort from friends. They’re usually busy around that time which I understand but I also can’t help but look back on how I always try my best to arrange surprises for each of my friends every year. I’m always the head of the group when it comes to planning a birthday yet It’s rare I ever receive anything. But yeah, I’m aware I’m not entitled to anything and it’s not like anyone asked me to host birthdays for others. I willingly put my heart and soul into my friends’ parties myself therefore have no right to complain when it’s not reciprocated. It’s getting harder to get through my birthday every year. Like I said, sometimes I immediately cry when being reminded. Last year, I even got depressed for days, crying nonstop and feeling nauseous almost every night prior to my actual birthday. My family celebrates of course, but honestly, I’m afraid I might break down in front of them one day. I feel like they treat it as less important than other events on that day which might be petty of me but that’s how I feel. Is there a way to overcome this? Btw I decided to post this because I was sitting on the dining table for an hour, unable to get up and wash the dishes because I was contemplating all this and lowkey crying again which got me scolded hard by my dad. So yeah, cherry on top. Yay. I’m crying on the stairs right now to avoid him. Any advice? Thoughts? And thank you for listening to my rant.;I’m 21 (F) and today isn’t even my birthday.

1bj5n2n;I'm starting being afraid of myself;InoriDragneel;"Everything became messy and confused in just some days, I can't keep up with myself. I've been in my bubble for some years (4-5), keeping myself busy with things I liked while neglecting everything I was and literally not thinking anything at all that could really touch me. It's really hard to explain, but after a trauma I was in bed 24/7 for like 3 months, every breath was poison, every thought was death. I even developed heart issue (all cause emotional pain) and had to take a pill. One day I just stopped living and I became some sort of robot that goes day by day, not feeling anything. 2 weeks ago I started watching a series, I loved it immediately, I started to fall in love with MC, and I was just looking forward to watching more episodes the next day. 1 week pass, the series finishes and I decide it's time for me to be whatever I am meant to be in my fucking head. The fact is, I loved the MC but I am actually just like her very deep inside myself, I find the way she lives life everyday the most precious thing in the world. But I am me, this is the real world and I am honestly so tired of being myself. My love for the MC shifted to the actress like it was the most humanly thing in the world, I am to really force myself to not think about her, to not think about the fact that it's crazy to feel something this deep and pure for a person I didn't even know existed 2 weeks ago, I never talked to her, she doesn't know I exist etc. My journey to be the really best version of myself as today, is brighter than ever. No appetite at all, can't sleep, I get sleepy, I go to bed, my mood drops drastically and I can't sleep. For some moments I may think ""I am good, I just want to help others and be relevant in a positive way in this world"" and then, like 10 minutes after I'm struggling breathing cause I'm nothing, I wasted so much time, I hate it here, this house, how everything in my life just happened, day by day, I can't even think of 1 time I was happy jesus Christ, I just want to appreciate it all, the little things, my cats, my pillow, my only family member still alive, but I am here, completely hopeless and no matter how hard I try, I can't love myself, It hurts so much. I am not good at dealing with pain, I am just not good at being a human I've come to realize. I don't think there's something someone can do to help me at this point, it's been some days I've been here wandering on Reddit reading all kind of things, it just seems like motivations is something not compatible with me. Then there's the other part, like things will get better, everything could happen, I will be be a glorious father of 4. I am not believing any of this, don't get me wrong, I would want to believe it with all my heart, I just can't. And yes, all this happened cause I watched a series on Netflix basically.

1bj30qb;I really need some help and advice.;SeaworthinessLive175;I am a 20 yr old male. I have a baby boy which is 2 and I absolutely love him with all my heart and soul. I am in a standing relationship with his mom. Allot has happened between us via it being monetary problems, sadness, parental issues you name it, it didn’t matter we had each other’s back that’s what I loved and admired about our relationship. Sadly everything comes to an end with me getting a job I genuinely enjoyed and surrounded by people who like her brought out the best in me. I did put in allot of time into that job and it did become difficult to manage time wise but I managed and separated both my family and my job and made my son and my girlfriend #1 priority. She didn’t see it that way, I tried to explain to her how what I’m doing is for them but she didn’t give me the light of day or even try to understand. It was frustrating because I was torn into two. Until last year June it snapped. I came back from a business trip out of state. Long flight and headache I just wanted to get back home. Turns out when I do get back I don’t get a warm welcome which I am used to at this point but still hurts me and I am told an ultimatum. It’s her or my job. #1 thing about me is I couldn’t give up on that part of myself because it brought me together and gave me wholesome joy and something I loved to do. I did not have anywhere to sleep and was struggling finding places for the next few months. I barely saw my son and when I did I made the best of it. I did what I could and still more. Unfortunately things started taking a turn and I felt as if I would lose the ability to see my son. She made certain rules (no legal action) but rules stating and limiting what I can and cannot do with my son. This really made me feel threatened and only thing I thought I could do was get back with his mom.  Yes I do love and support her I told her I always will support her. I just don’t think I can for much longer. I don’t see us living together again, getting married and doing what we said we would do. Since that day I was given the ultimatum I’ve been numb and contemplated ending myself. I feel numb and only things that fulfill me is my son and my one hobby which is golf. I hate my job, hate my circumstance, but I know I must do it because I have a role to fulfill. I feel utterly lost because I dream allot of my old job and colleagues and I just want to go back but I don’t want to jeopardize my relationship with my son. I am scared and terrified but atleast I know I am not completely numb. I really am lost and I don’t want to be in a relationship and down the line it turns to remorse and hate towards each other because my son, his mom nor me deserve that. Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thank you all and may your life journey get better.;I am a 20 yr old male.

1bj23i9;Every day is the same and it feels meaningless to even be here anymore.;superblyanxious;I’m tired.I’m disabled & suffer with mental illness (chronic depression, C-PTSD, & anxiety). I’m also may be autistic. All of these things make my life challenging. I can’t live it like most other people.I can’t get a job + income to help me move out, my disability & anxiety make that impossible, but I’m also not disabled enough by my governments standards to get on disability payments. I still have to muster up the energy to go in and see someone to find out if they have options for someone like me to simply be able to live in this world.Going out and meeting friends is impossible because they’re too far away, and we’re all either unwell all the time or it’s just not possible to meet.My parents don’t support who I am as a person and that has been crippling me with grief since we spoke about it the last time. I don’t feel comfortable being myself, I feel ashamed of who I am because of their beliefs (they’re not outright harmful or hateful towards me, but their beliefs fucking hurt and they know that, but don’t care to change it). I don’t want to be in this situation anymore.Every day is the same. It’s not routine, it’s survival, and I’m tired of it. I want to go out when I want to, I want to spend time with people who love & support me for who I am, I want time, I want to experience things. It’ll never change, it isn’t physically possible. There’s nothing I can do to help myself and that makes me all the more upset.If I had it in me, I wouldn’t be here anymore. I don’t even know why I bother holding on.

1bj1d60;Feeling like a failure ;Sad_Signature4498;"Hey, I've made this account to vent or i guess to talk about everything without having to bothers friends and partner. The random username they gave me is almost ironic. Anyways, a bit of background before everything. I'm currently 19, i've been living for this cursed mind of mine for so long, i can't really pin point when it all started, i guess around 8-10yo ish, but things only got worse around 12-13yo, that's when i basically dropped out, and my biggest regret now. It was at 15yo that i actually started therapy and got diagnosed, until 18yo where i became too old for the juvenile mental ward (i'm not sure if the translation is correct) they thought i was ""healed"", sadly so did i, and honestly, i fell deeper at the time. And here's today's me, without education whatsoever and no work experience. I'm living with my older brother and mother. A few months ago, my brother talked about moving out together at the start of the year if i find a job, i think he gave up on that idea. My mother is borderline going to move to Switzerland to join her boyfriend. I feel like deadweight, the only thing holding the both of them back from living their own lives. I do want to find a job in order to live independently but i'm just frightened of it all. Nor can i turn my interest and hobbies into a profit, i lack the skills for that. I feel like the only thing i can realistically become is a writer, from the few things i've shared, it seems that my writing is quite appreciated. I do quite enjoy writing but it doesn't seems enough, i lack the motivation of just opening the page, the motivation to type a single letter.I know i have flaws, i know everything can't be perfect. That life is rough and i gotta endure it. When i think of it as a 3rd person perspective, my life isn't as bad as it feels, there's so many things I could do, learn, improve, to get out of the cycle. But down there, i really feel like there's no duch thing as beating depression";Hey, I've made this account to vent or i guess to talk about everything without having to bothers fr;REQUESTING SUPPORT;1;2;2024-03-20 01:19:14;2024-03-20;Wednesday;01:19:14;1961;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:49.854615
1bizd6c;kind of feel like I’m losing my mind;According_Speed8743;I (21f) hardly know how to articulate any of this, and I’ve never made a post on reddit before, always just lurked, so it does feel a bit weird. But I don’t know where else to go at the moment. I have friends and family who love me, but I know that there’s only so much they can do. (cw/heads up for suicidal ideation and self-harm)Without divulging many details, I’ll provide the context that I’ve been put through a lot of trauma from an early age. Abuse and neglect and other worse things, as well as the fact that my body functions very poorly. My father is a Lupus patient, so I’ve always been told to watch out for it, but getting a diagnosis is tricky. Despite that I’ve lived my life for so long enduring pain and sickness and being disabled in those “invisible” ways that make you get dismissed by most of those around you. I’m also a bit underweight sometimes— have been my whole life, I’m just a small girl. I get condescended a lot by doctors, and more often than not they just tell me “oh, you just need to get your weight up and you’ll feel better!” then theyd put me on pills and give me protein shakes and send me on my way. None of that ever did anything. I knew it wouldn’t, and that this is just the size that I am and always have been, but no one would listen to me. I never thought there was something wrong with my body until I started being constantly told that there was. Now I don’t like myself anymore. I’ve been on a few antidepressants over the years. Zoloft currently. For a while it seemed to keep me stable and help my suicidal thoughts lessen, but something just broke at some point recently. Not sure what. I relapsed with self-harm, then a few days later I started experiencing unbearable waves of nausea throughout the day and night. I had to miss work two shifts in a row, then last night ended up in the hospital because it had gotten so horrible. After hours of tests and bloodwork and waiting in a miserable cold hospital bed while staring at a tiny television mounted on the wall that I couldn’t be bothered to turn on, I was told that everything came back perfectly fine. I was given some zofran and sent on my way.I know that they did what they could, but I was struggling not to break down in tears when they told me nothing was wrong. I feel even more directionless now. I can’t seem to go 30 minutes without crying my eyes out at how sad and broken and weak I feel. I’m very dizzy and can’t stand for very long. I’m going to see my mental health provider tomorrow, but I’m not feeling very hopeful about it. I feel like a mistake.

1bim8jm;How I pull myself out of a crisis;Glittering_Initial44;"Remember a suicidal crisis typically lasts no more than10-15 minutes. It doesn't really matter what we distract ourselves with...If we can JUST WAIT, then we will stay safe.I know it's hard but just for a moment, put all problems aside. Stop running scenarios and memories.""I am here. I am now. I am safe"". Repeat. STOP. Just freeze. Your mind and your body. Look around and find no current and immediate threat to your life.Slow your breath, breathe a bit deeper because a brain without oxygen doesn't do much rationalizing, only panicking. Fuller, slower breathes. Don’t stop. Relax your tense muscles. You're in fight or flight, your body is geared up. We're ""un-gearing"" it.Find something in every color of the rainbow. Red.Orange. Yellow. Etc..Feel your feet on the floor. Really pay attention to them. Feel the floor, grass, shoes.""I am here. I am now. I am safe"".Live in the immediate present moment as much as you can. The past is f’d up, it's not safe there. The future seems insurmountable, uncertain, like you're only ever going to feel the way you do right now (which isn't true!!!). And how are we supposed to live if it's always that way. The future is filled with too many variables and uncertainties, it's not safe either. (You can worry about the future when you are finally stable and come out on the other side of this shit show.)One day at a time can be way too much sometimes.Focus on the RIGHT NOW. Focus on calming your body and your mind will eventually follow. Even if that's all you do, all day every day. THAT'S OKAY!!! We hold ourselves to the highest expectation and we need to learn to give ourselves some grace during our healing journey. You've been through some traumatizing shit, I'm sure. This is how your mind and body survived. You're here now. And you're safe. And you will get through it. Just take care of your body the best you can. Try to love it even when you hate it.

At the end of the sleepover, my other friend, who's also friends with John, told me that John's father told his father that he didn't have a good time, wasn't included, and was bullied by another kid at the sleepover, despite them not having any interactions.

1bhtjbl;Changing meds - Time off work? Looking for advice/encouragement ;Practical-Ad7127;Hi All, I’ve been trying different medications for the last few years to treat my depression. I tried Wellbutrin then Effexor. Have been going to see my doctor and I took some time off work In January to try an increase in Effexor while trying to sort out, without the pressure of work, how I was feeling. Ultimately, have concluded I don’t think Effexor is working the way it should for me, so my doctor and I decided to try to titrate down on Effexor so we can prepare to try something new. However, since I was starting back up at work again, I decided I didn’t think I had the capacity to go off a med and start a new med, figure out how I was feeling, etc all while working again. My job is pretty mentally draining! I’m going to my doctor again to talk about this. I think I just ultimately feel bad about putting my colleagues in a bind and since I’m pretty high functioning, I always think I can get through this. But, realistically, I think I need to focus on my wellness and take time off work again in order to go off Effexor and try another med to see if it works. I think I’m looking for validation ultimately maybe? Finances aren’t a concern. I have lots of sick time and when/if I run out of sick time, I have short-term and long term disability coverage. My thoughts are so hard to organize I find. I want to go do well and help my colleagues out, but I also don’t think I can fathom doing all the medication stuff and figure out how I’m feeling while working a mentally draining job!

1bhs0e9;my friend doesn't want to understand my depression;Character_Berry_8273;"Long story short, I (F25) have depression.It's not 'a cutsy' depression. It's 'back in last october, I was going to attempt' depression. But I didn't because of one close dear friend. So I went to a doctor.I took my meds for 6 months and stopped. During the weeks of taking smaller doses, I was also moving to another city. Everything was feeling overwhelming, I started to become passive and I stopped putting any effort into my frienships. I don't reply to dms not because I dont want to but because I become on energy saving mode, and I only reply to texts and dms that feel important.I took the time to heal, and adjust to being off the pills, and all the new changes. Meanwhile, I was thinking: ""This is the best way, this way I don't have to drain or burden my friends, especially my close friend who communicated to me a prior time when my depression was severe that I was weighing in on them and that they pushed me away because they felt overwhelmed with my depression.""I thought I was doing them a service. I was knee-deep into the thought: ""my absence is the best thing I can offer this dear friend, because my love is not enough""And I was starting to feel a little bit better, because I dived into volunteer work and a friend of mine came to my place and spent the weekend together, it felt nice.So I thought to text my friend a text of ""I hope my absence gives you the peace my love couldn't"".And it was like I opened a can of worms.Their texts were passive-aggressive, they were not kind at all, and they were mad. I was mad too.We jumped on a looong call and we thought we did made up. But the next day, some of the stuff they said during the fight was really hurtful. So I texted them that, and they apologized and said that they were still mad about what happened. I told them let's give each other space.It's sad that they didn't want to understand that when you're depressed, you push away the people who know you the best because you feel like a liability. They got mad because I texted then that text when they thought I was ghosting them, I tried to explain to them that it's not personal, I pushed away my parents, even.I tried to explain it multiple times but they insisted that I didn't want to put in the effort and could have been able to text them about me taking a step back, but I tried to explain to them that in my depressed brain, I couldn't.It's sad because out of all people, I thought they were the only people who would understand. I am aware that my actions have consequences. I did apologize via text later that I am sorry if I cause any hurt. But my whatsapp text got only one tick, when I googled it, it says that happens when someone blocks you.In the meanwhile, I contacted again another friend and they were so understanding, didn't even take personal and were so glad that I feel better now.I wish my other friend would understand.

1bhohou;I need a break from college until September;SubjectHoneydew7162;So I’m 19 and am studying 3 A levels full time, I also still live at home. I struggle with mental health problems due to childhood abse from my dad, step dad, and mum’s neglect. I’ve tried my hardest to get to college everyday but I’m struggling, with my attendance being at 11%. I’m missing out on so much and I hate myself for it, I love college but I struggle to get up and motivated. I’ve told my mum that I would like a break until September, when I can start the year again since I’ve missed so much I know I won’t pass my first year exams. It’s important to know that I will be starting sertraline for my mental health soon, that’s why I know in September I will be able to maintain my attendance better. However, if I quit college until September my mum will lose quite a bit of money in benefits for me. So she’s told me I cannot quit and if I do I will have to move out. I’ve tried to quit in January this year but was told the same thing, so I tried to force myself to continue but it hasn’t changed. It’s getting worse. I get money every month that I spend on stuff that I want/need so I don’t ask my mum for things. She also takes half of the money I get, as well as £700 from benefits for me. She’s on sick leave from her job (a respectable medical job) to take care of my sick sister. The only thing that is making her force me to go to college or move out is the £700 she would lose. However she will lose that money in August when I have to claim it myself, so I’ve offered to half it with her. I’m not sure if this makes sense so I’m sorry if it doesn’t. I would move out but in England’s economy I just can’t afford to, especially since I may need to pay for my education in September if I start again. I just cannot pay for rent and student loans. I don’t know what to do, I’ll gonna get kicked out of college (most likely today) or I’m gonna get kicked out of my mums house. Please any advice would help, I can’t see a way through this I just want to end it all. (I don’t work due to mental and physical health problems at the minute so I get benefits to help me through college until I’m in a better position to work. I don’t plan on living off benefits for long, I really do want to work once I’ve finished college) please be honest with your answers, I won’t be offended if you think I’m the problem.;So I’m 19 and am studying 3 A levels full time, I also still live at home.

1bheifp;How do you find motivation when you're depressed?;rosegoldpoppy;What do you do to help get motivation back?I was diagnosed at 20 with depression but probably had it since about 15 or 16 for sure, maybe a little earlier. I'm 30 now. I've noticed that in the past couple of years or so I've been getting more depressed and less motivated. I just don't feel emotion like I used to and I don't have motivation to do things, even the things I used to love. I get up, I go to work, I come home, and I rot in bed for hours thinking about the things I should do and the things I want to do.There's so many things I should be doing, like getting my taxes sorted, repotting some plants, finishing some art I started, etc but I just can't bring myself to do any of it. It's been a couple of years now of just massive loss of motivation. I have such a hard time bringing myself to do something for myself, even feeding myself. I'm laying in bed right now listening to my stomach grumble because I forgot to eat today but I don't have the motivation to make anything. I gave the snack I had in my car to a stray dog today, but I wasn't planning on not eating at all, it just happened. I'm at a loss and I just don't feel like myself.

1bhb7ti;I'm useless;Standard-Guitar-5650;I (19F) have depression or at least was diagnosticated since i was 14, I saw my therapist  since then until I was 17, when she said I was alright, I felt better during that time, but since last year, I left school for a year due to the pandemic, and it was the best of my life, but when I have to return to school. I actually don't like going to class, I like to learn new things by myself, but having to wake up so early, being unable to understand most of the classes and everytime I went to a teacher to ask feel like I'm just making them waste their time. The last year I only cry by the end of the semester because I failed an assignment, the last semester (we have to semesters per year) I cried almost every month, I started feeling worst because I had to attend to extra classes until the night, so I could barely be in my home, during this semester I couldn't do any of the things I like the most, like drawing or play videogames. I just started this semester, I lost the first two weeks of class and it's been difficult to understand any class, the good point, I can be more time in my home than before. But I've been crying every day, I told my mom I want to go back to the therapy because I'm feeling like shit, but she said I had to wait until my appointment with the psychiatrist until April.Today I tried to do a separator for my carpet, and I just felt worst, I thought it would be fun try to do something that I liked, but I just felt like buying the material was just a waste of money, right now I'm trying not to cry because I don't like when people saw me like that, so... Yeah, that's how I've been feeling this year, sorry if it's long or my orthography isn't the best, English is not my first language, I needed to vent somewhere else that's not my mom or the only friend I have.

This is just my experience.When I’m deep in my depression, my hygiene can go out the window…especially brushing my hair which is long and pretty thick. I can go weeks sometimes without brushing it, just throwing it up in a ponytail or a bun if I have to. I get knots all over and usually develop a bit of a rat’s nest at the back of my neck. I have tried tons of different detangling solutions and brushes. Nothing has come close to the Unbrush. It works best with wet conditioned hair but I’ve used it dry on mine with no issues. It doesn’t rip out or break your hair and it doesn’t hurt at all. I was skeptical when my husband got it for me, but it has become my favorite brush. I highly recommend it if you have the same problems as I did. Also, try to get it on Amazon, it’s cheaper than TikTok shop and it’s usually in stock. I hope this helps someone else.🙂;First off, I am not affiliated with the Unbrush company and I make no money off Unbrush sales.

1bgwg78;Motivation, hobby and external validation issues... Need some advice and support;Kiwi-my-beloved;"Hello everyone.So... how do I even begin? Maybe that I don't really talk with people about my feelings, preferring to keep them for myself so it's kinda new to me. But yeah, I'll se what I can do.I've always wanted to get into game development and make a game of my own. I've been passionate about 3D art and wanted to make a next step, make a game that I could be proud of, even if it was a simple one. However, every time I sit down to it, I try doing something I get this block, can't move, am overwhelmed and then get distracted and procrastinate scrolling youtube. I've tried different technics like dividing it into smaller tasks, doing breaks etc. but it seemed not to work. Soon the 3D art passion faded when I got busy with schoolwork and even though I still want to make a game, I realized that I probably will never be able to, that I'll never succeed. Seeing others make their dream project became demotivating and depressing, not inspiring. I feel like I'm in this limbo, unable to try again but somewhere still wanting to. Please don't think I've been scoping way too high and aiming to remake GTA 5 scale stuff. No, I was real, wanted to make something small, simple but fun and what's most important, mine.And so I've come to a conclusion, tried to understand why did I want to get into this hobby in the first place. please keep in mind that I never wanted to do this for money, but for appreciation, maybe for attention as well. I wanted to make a game that people would play, even for free and have fun, give me feedback and praise. Just a simple ""That was great, you could also do x!"" would have been enough to satisfy me.Every time I've tried to make something more, to be seen, it always ended up with... meh. Took a part in a country big championship and got into top 20? I didn't win so yeah, move on. Organized and coordinated a big school even that the teacher took the credit for? Didn't even get a public ""Thank you"", but instead was tossed into a bag with everyone else. Recently I've made an extra effort on my physics class when I was presenting about diodes. I've made a nice presentation which everyone did but I done extra. I've brought diodes, cables, resistors and so on, made a lot of examples physically with stuff glowing, spinning etc. to show different uses. I though it was interesting and entertaining but as soon as the bell rang everyone turned around and left, like if just waiting for it. Nobody asked questions, nobody said it was nice. And that's what happens every time.I'll be honest, I don't know where to find motivation to keep going like that, to try and make something extra when I don't get anything in return. That's why I wanted to get into game dev. I wanted appreciation, to be told that I matter and I've made something that someone has genuinely enjoyed. I want someone to come to me and ask a question, to chat about what I have made/done, say something nice or suggest. I want to be seen, to have a purpose and people who enjoy what I put out. I want external validation, that's what it is probably called if I'm not wrong.Yet, that feeling of demotivation mixed with inability to actually start working on anything, feeling like I'm not good enough and won't make anything good has brought me here. Kind of somber, kind of feeling like I don't matter and won't matter.Hope you have an amazing day and cya <3";Hello everyone.So... how do I even begin?

We got talking again after a couple months of not talking as she was depressed, I didn’t even know at the time and so didn’t text her either as I thought she wasn’t interested in talking anymore. We hung out afterwards and she was very depressed for a month or so. Afterwards, for some reason, she started improving. We hung out weekly, went to museums, city trips and more. Before Christmas she got a bf, I met him as I was house sitting and we chatted for a while before I got my train home. It went really well and I was happy for them both. I didn’t hear from her for two weeks which wasn’t usual I found out she broke up with a new bf which seemed to be going well I thought. I told her I was sorry about the situation and would give her space and she finally replied saying okay, thanks. 3 weeks later I was thinking about her one night and told her I missed her. I felt bad afterwards and I did truly and do truly miss her a lot at this point. Two weeks and she hasn’t replied and I didn’t expect a reply until she’s ready but I feel like I could possibly do more? Maybe I should just leave her but maybe I should message her every few weeks with positivity? I don’t know?

1bge8zu;My husband is depressed, how can I support him?;EquivalentAcadia1332;My husband suffered from a chronic pain condition that made it difficult for him to function. Despite this, he always had a positive attitude and was as active as he could be. I admired him for his resilience and optimism, given everything he went through.After about 20 years of suffering with chronic pain, he finally found a medication that helped… for a couple years. When the medication stopped working a few months ago and his condition returned, he attempted to take his own life. He showed no signs of depression prior to the night of the attempt—no behavior changes, no mood swings, nothing. Same happy hubby. It was a complete shock.Thankfully, he survived. Even better news—he was able to find another medication that has been working really well for him. All of his symptoms from his condition are no longer present. He is fully functional and pain free again.Given that he tried to take his own life because of his condition returning, I thought his depression would lift once he got on this medication and his symptoms went back into remission… but that doesn’t seem to be the case. He sleeps all the time. He won’t eat, and he’s losing weight fast. He doesn’t want to go anywhere or see anyone. He hardly wants to interact with me. None of this is normal behavior for him. I thought depression, or any of his current symptoms, might be side effects of his new medication or withdrawals from his old one, but after speaking with his doctor, they don’t seem to be. He’s not open to therapy or antidepressants. He won’t eat the food I make him or get out of bed no matter how much I beg him to. He doesn’t seem to think any of this is even a problem and he gets irritated when I bring it up. He swears that he’s not depressed and that he isn’t upset about anything. He’s just “not hungry” or “tired” or “doesn’t feel like doing anything today.”I’m terrified. My soulmate is struggling I don’t know what to do. I can’t make him get help, and I don’t know how else I can convince him that this is a big problem.

1bgdfx0;Asking for help broke us up;IsolatedFoox;"I 19NB and my now ex bf 24M were together for over a year, we bonded instantly when we first met which was on tinder. I just got out of a toxic poly relationship so this was going to be a new break i thought. Until on the 2nd meetup he told me he was poly, I wanted to continue to get to know him and love him so i just took it. It's been a wonderful year one of my best, I haven't had allot of smiles because I have MDD (major depressive disorder) and chronic anxiety. I have allot of things in my life that made me sad like loosing a pet, loosing my best friend, loosing my brothers and so on. So I was on some pretty heavy psyche meds. We still haven't found my happy cocktail but I always have had trouble taking my pills, because I feel lile it shouldn't be a backbone for me to lean on i should be able to handle shit on my own. Anyways, me and my bf at the time let's just call him Brian, (not his real name) we shared so many things especially towards the end of 2023 he came to Chicago to meet my family and to explore it was wonderful! We had a blast, but even in the roadtrip home it was pleasant.  I don't know what happened in 2024 but something changed in him and I was just to blinded by love to see it.  It was already a rough year to begin with but then it just got worse for me. I just started previously using THC for my sleep cause I have really bad night terrors, insomnia, and ptsd episodes at night so it helps me calm down. But in Chicago I got the real stuff, weed. I don't smoke it but I eat the chocolate stuff. Anyways I had some stuff I wanted to talk with  Brian about and to get the confidence I asked for some chocolate. He gave me a rather large peice I thought to myself maybe this is too much so I asked him and he confirmed himself that it was the right amount. It wasn't. Basically before any shit happened I got high and told him stuff and had a mental moment asking for help with my pills because I keep forgetting or just not taking them. Bit I knew I had too. Long story short 5 mins later I had a seizure abd I greened out. (Overdose term for weed) I had to go to the hospital for awhile but I has discharged the next day. My bf and I had just moved in together on February 1st in our first apartment together for context and I was very stressed.. anyways. I wasn't charged with anything cause it was seen as a overdose thank God. But in March 2024 my birthday month he in the beginning of the month was fine, was helping me with my pills everything was fine. It was my friends birthday so we celebrated hers aswell. Not even 3 days later I get a text at 8:23pm while I was picking up my uncle from the airport that ""we should separate from eachother"" his words not mine. Yeah didn't take that well. I didn't understand so I texted back why? Basically he said that my trauma defined me too much, (I get ptsd episodes), I act too childish at times (im a little sometimes soand he knew that..) and he said the tipping point was when I asked for help to take my meds. he broke up with me because I asked for help. Fucking he'll yeah that did some fuckin 💔 damage. I almost had to go to the hospital cause of SH relapses and stuff. But yeah.. am I the asshole for asking fot help?";I 19NB and my now ex bf 24M were together for over a year, we bonded instantly when we first met whi;REQUESTING ADVICE;2;0;2024-03-16 19:03:17;2024-03-16;Saturday;19:03:17;3218;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:51.139569

(Father and grandfather had it.) As each day comes and goes, I am that much increasingly scared that I am suffering from that dreaded diagnosis. The past four months I have been dealing with Over Active Bladder (OAB) and the more research I find to find relief, the more I find that the best relief is with prostate removal.Of which the most frightening aspect is that I would not ever be able to ejaculate the same again. Which means, sex would be never part of my Life again. That hits very deep to me.To add on to my misery about this, I have not had a partner since I lost my virginity to a brothel in my mid-twenties. Yeah, three decades.With those stated, here are my dominos that I am contending with: I want to have a partner again but I have no “game”; My lack of experience will/may be a red flag to someone; Part of me wants the experience of “playing the field”, of which I know that I am too old now for that to happen; I don’t think I want to find someone whom would be a long term partner as part of my initial exploration; Strip Clubs and other questionably-legal methods of release do have any interest to me; i.e. Strip Clubs are just teasing that gives no real value to the money spent on it, I thought I used to enjoy it, but have come to my senses about it.    e.g. Massage Parlors are risky ventures, some call it a “Hobby”, that have repercussions that I can not justify and also remind me of my physical shortcomings that put me into a funk. Currently my use of pornography (denotative) as my current means of relief, most likely is shaping the other/previous aspects of my life;On top of all this, I am dealing with the loss of my father whom was the last of my close family members. Granted his sister, my aunt, is a shout away, but I still feel completely alone in this world.

1bfx4je;Hi to whoever is reading, hope you're keeping well.;Plastic-Tangelo-1114;I'm 27 F and i have depression. Or at least i think i do? I've been seeing a lot of therapists since i was 20, but only because i realized no one around me would help me even if i screamed for help in their faces. I was self-harming and had a few suicide attempts before finishing high school, after that i started to drink and i kinda got distracted by life and work and everything to forget the feeling of being empty and void of emotions, or maybe feeling too much at times. I hope i'm making sense.After being in a really bad place i went to a therapist but it didn't really help, so i stopped. Then just before the pandemic started i started again, and continued with that therapist but again, didn't really help. I started being medicated and i felt numb all the time, which was better i guess.At the end of 2020 y had another suicide attempt, and that time i self-commited to a psychiatric hospital, in which i was in only for 8 days i think. I got out and everyone was really supportive of me, almost as if everyone felt pitty.In november of 2021 i moved to live with my dad (divorced parents, lived with mom and stepdad before moving - not relevant, they are good parents) and i thought i had everything under control, but turns out i didn't. Ha, lucky me.Now, i'm engaged, i love my fiancee, he's a great guy, but i just can't feel happy anymore. I tried telling him how i feel but i don't think he fully understands what i'm going through. And i don't want him to, but every day i wake up exhausted, not wanting to get out of bed, feeling like i have to keep appearences just so everyone doesn't pitty me anymore. And tonight, 30 minutes ago, i had suicide thoughts again. My birthday is in 4 days, and honestly, i don't want to get there. My mother couldn't come last year because of an event my half-sister had with her voleyball team, i have a few friends here but i have not told them this side of me, and i'm afraid to do so. I only have one best friend (26M) but he doesn't have the money to come right now, and i don't want to tell him anything to not make him or anyone else worry.I seriously don't know what to do.Oh, and i said that i think i have depression because, even after everything that i've been through, no therapist thinks i have anything wrong with me. They all think i just can't regulate my emotions or something to that extent. I can't ask for help from anyone, and i feel so alone right now...Guess that's it, hope that made some sense. And if i made some mistake, sorry, English is not my first language.Hope you all have a good one.;I'm 27 F and i have depression. Or at least i think i do?

1bffcht;Looking for advice on changing my thinking;Epic_Toys;"Trying to improve myself and having trouble changing where my thoughts go. I am always thinking about the past, people that have left my life. Going from remembering the good times to missing what could have been, making scenarios where I finally get to say goodbye even though they left long ago. I know this is a big issue that is keeping me stuck. I have been telling myself NO when my mind starts to focus on these things, to the point that I just repeat exactly what I am currently doing (e.g. work, driving) in an attempt to force the thoughts out.Creating this ""life"" in my head is keeping me from actually living, I can't seem to move on to start to find new things to enjoy. To be honest I have convinced my self that I don't deserve a life, to be happy, that all I exist for is my responsibilities. I just need some help, some direction, advice that may help me out.This is something I know will take time and lots of work but I'm stuck on how to do it.

1bfeawg;Depressed BF (23) doesn't want to get help and his mental help is worsening. What do I do?;Camillettexoxo;"I (23F) discovered that my BF was depressed after being 4 years together. Early in the relationship, he told me that when we met (and weren't in a relationship) he was depressed, but that since he had gotten with me it had gotten better. To be honest, I didn't question it more, as naive as I was, I thought all his pain had gotten away.Bit of context: I met my boyfriend online and had an online relationship with him for a year. We then lived together for 3 years, and he seemed ""ok"". I had never seen him in a bad head space. He then left to go study abroad because he didn't really manage to study in my country. It has now been one year and a half since he's left for his studies and since we've been having a long-distance relationship again.Now, 1 year ago (or half a year since he left to study abroad), I discovered that he has been depressed the entire time. I of course, had so many questions to ask and I just wanted to help in any way I could, but he closed himself off and still does. At any time, I would ask why he feels this way, why he feels like he feels empty, all he says is ""I don't want to talk about it."" I’m sorry if those are bad questions, I truly don’t know how to behave in those times or what to say.I don’t know what he’s going through, and I want to make his life as easy as possible, but I don’t know what to do. I think it hurts him a lot to talk about why he feels this way and what he feels, but if he doesn’t, can I even help him somehow or can he get the professional help he needs? I’ve asked him to see a psychiatrist and get help, but he refuses (no time because of his studies and he thinks the therapy won’t help him, because I cite: I’ve always felt like this, and it will never change. It can’t be fixed. I already went to a psychologist, and it didn’t help.)I know I can’t convince my BF to get help and I know I can’t fix him, but I don’t want him to feel worse and worse.I can’t talk to his family about it, because he REALLY does not want me to talk about it. It’d make him angry if his family get implicated in all of this, because they can get really nosey sometimes.I think it can be important to add that he has tried to be more communicative about his feelings and I really appreciate his efforts. He tries to close me off less and I see it. But even though he’s trying I feel like his mental state is worsening slowly.Since he’s left to study abroad, these bad days have become more frequent. He feels like he has no energy, he is exhausted, empty, lonely. I’m scared for him.What can I do? What shouldn’t I do? What should say/not say? I’m scared to suffocate him and that he’ll leave me. How can I help to maybe help him get this professional help, get meds if needed. Can meds and therapy really help? Would he getter better at some point? If meds and therapy don’t help, what could?I do visit him every time my studies allow it, but what can I do, since I’m far away from him, I can’t even support him “physically”. I won’t be able to live with him for one more year and a half.I don’t want to sound like it’s all about me, but also, how do I deal with the feelings I have? I don’t really have friends to talk to and I don’t want my family to know. When he has those bad days, I feel so stressed and scared. I keep asking myself questions like, will he take his own life, will he leave me, does he even still love me? I know it shouldn’t be about me, but I can’t help it, I’m sorry if it seems rude.";I (23F) discovered that my BF was depressed after being 4 years together.

All it wants is to feel again. But it can't, nothing but pain. Without emotion there is no motivation, except for stress, which causes even more anarchy in my brain. All my brain wants is for me to shut my eyes and never open them. Live the rest of my life in my vivid imagination, where I have already recreated the real world, with all the people I care about. Because in that world I can do what I want. There are no consequences. And in that world, I feel things again. Sadness, happiness, laughter. I have all my friends still. I can enjoy my time with them, even if they are mere figments of my imagination. I get to feel that love again, from a friend to another or toward a family member. It's great. But the real world?

1bew4a3;I think my sister is planning her suicide;cindabueno;To be clear, I am fine. This post is about my sister. She's turning 22 next month and has been going through a real rough patch recently which resulted in her attempting some time ago. For months now she's been at rock bottom. We've tried to help the best we can but she struggles with conveying emotions so we rarely get through to her. However on Monday it's as if a switch flipped. She's gone from extremely depressed (not showering or eating, brushing her teeth, rotting in bed) to the happiest i've ever seen her. Her hair was matted, every piece of clothing she owned was dirty, stacks of dirty dishes in her room, the list goes on. She's become so happy, almost euphoric. Smoking weed used to be an occasional thing (maybe once a month?) now she smokes everyday. She's splurging on unnecessary items, got her hair done, bought hundreds of new clothing and has even booked a solo trip overseas. Of course i'm happy because she's happy, but the last time she became this happy immediately after a depressive episode, she attempted to kill herself. She hates when anyone speaks regarding her mental state, so i'm completely lost here. I don't want to trigger her, but i'm so so worried we're going to have a repeat of last time and i'm even more worried she'll succeed.

To the point where he just sleeps, games or if he's inconvenienced or frustrated, goes into a fit of rage. And again, this has been his response for years as well.For the past year or so, my SO has been in an almost constant state of depression, to which he blames me because I can't get him out of it and I stopped his 'flow'.

1beu1r0;Can’t stop crying ;Responsible-Skirt426;Hi… I have been in a toxic work environment for the past year and a half. The only reason I have put up with it and not tried to find something new is because this job opportunity was super rare for me to find and will set me up for financial independence for the future. I come from an immigrant family and so I grew up poor. I am making more money than my mom ever has and have been helping out my family all while trying to work towards my financial freedom. I have a ton of debt from years of schooling and this job would be able to help me pay off this debt after 8 more years. Unfortunately for the past 4-6 months, I have been the target of my supervisor and have been having mental breakdowns constantly. My work is never enough and I am constantly getting feedback (in writing) about nitpicky details. Yes, I understand that I did mess up but the way the feedback comes across is very upsetting. She has not once given me a call to explain or let me explain and all the feedback has been very paper traily! Her supervisor and ultimately my big boss, were on good terms but for the last couple of months I have seen a shift in her behavior and demeanor towards me. I have expressed my concerns to my coworkers in which I feel they understand but they are not in charge so it’s more like venting. It’s been to the point where I get super anxious to even log into my computer and super anxious to actually do my work. I try to double and triple check my work as much as I can but still it is not god enough. I am ripped apart. The most recent incident I can agree was a big mistake on my part and had some public implications and I think I am 95% sure I am going to lose my job. And I cannot stop crying. I really really need this job. I am not financially stable and depend on this job and depend on the income and future debt relief. I don’t even know what I would do if I did lose it. I have been anxious and on edge with insomnia, chest pains, panic attacks, difficulty concentrating, feeling tired all the time and Naturally this has made my depression worse. I can’t stop crying after the most recent incident and my future at my job so up in the air. I’m down bad so much so that I am having suicidal thoughts. If I lose my job, it just proves that everyone right that I am shit at it and I’ll be letting my family down.

1beok1w;Getting up in the morning ;Disastrous_Truck7622;I’ve struggled with depression since middle school, and waking up in the morning has been a struggle since then. I hate it, it is by far the hardest and worst part of my day. I feel like I am dragging myself out of bed everyday. I wait until the last possible second to get as much sleep as I can, sometimes staying in bed until 10 minutes before I have to leave for work. I feel rushed and exhausted every mornin. On the weekends I sleep until noon because of how tired I am. I usually go to bed early too, before 10:30 pm and I leave for work by 7am, so I think I get enough sleep most of the time. I’m not sure what is wrong with me or why I can’t get up.

1be4qsy;Having a hard time getting rid of my depression despite years of trying ;JSinghLV;Hi, 33 M of South Asian Decent. I’ll try to keep it short. I come from an immigrant, low income family. I was born in India, and I was there with my mom and 2 brothers until the age of 5. My father had moved to the US for a better opportunities and escape oppression. My parents are not educated, and so they really empathized to me that I need to be educated and set an example for the rest of the family and the future generations. When I was 7, one of my brothers committed suicide in India. I was always told that this was a car accident, but as I got older & visited India I eventually figured it out. My surviving brother ended up moving to the US, but since he did not get a proper education in India the pressure was put on me even more to succeed and to take care of my family. I struggled through the years, worked jobs since I was a teenager to support myself through school. When I got to college I was diagnosed with depression. I took different medications and went to therapy for years and years. But nothing has really helped. I am now a dentist and working. I make good enough money to support myself and my family. But my career and patients often stress me out. I don’t feel fulfilled and I feel like I have lost my willpower to advance further in my career. It is a tough job and all I hear most of the time is complaining from patients and how much they hate seeing the dentist.My family have a lot of issues between each other and I am asked to help them but they don’t even listen to me. It’s more just them complaining to me, asking for advice and then not taking it. I feel like I have gone through so much of my life to set myself up for happiness and success but I have not been experiencing it. My depression and anxiety weighs on me so much. I have been trying to exercise, meditate/pray, go to group/individual therapy, & keep busy as well as rest/relax. I have lost joy of doing the things I used to enjoy. Time is just passing by.

I attended and, the school was really supportive.  My AC hugged me tightly and my other teachers said how I was missed. It was really nerve racking going back today and I was unbelievably anxious regarding it butIt wasn't bad I might actually go back tomorrow, like, on time and everything And even stay for after school So, idk how motivating this really is but, whatever is making you anxious or afraid to do something You should probably just do itThere's a high chance that things won't go nearly as bad as you think, and you'll feel, a bit better about yourself. At least, that's how it was for me To anyone struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts and anxiety, it's okay. It doesn't feel okay. It never feels okay.

1bdyrpn;Ghosted By Roommates ;Firewall_Fighter;"I'm a 19-year-old living in a hostel for the past 8 months. Unfortunately, my roommates and their 2-3 friends have ghosted me. We share a room of three, while the other two have a group of 4-5. Here's the situation: I'm a computer major, and the other two are AI majors in the same class. Things started well in college with the three of us and two other friends, let's call them A and B, forming a group of five. However, as time passed, our friend circle expanded, including two more guys from the same AI major, whom I'll call C and D. I had issues with those two; one of them behaves similarly to my roommates, and the other, D, attempted to manipulate me into switching beds with him, which I refused. Despite my efforts to expand my social circle, my roommates preferred to keep to themselves, unlike me, who enjoys making friends.Every day, we used to gather and discuss various topics like politics, media, and fun stuff. Sometimes, when I needed to study, I would ask them to keep quiet, which annoyed D. Eventually, all four of them stopped talking to me for reasons I'm not sure about, but I suspect D is behind it. It's been two months, and the situation hasn't improved. Additionally, other hostel guys avoid coming to my room because of my roommates' behavior. I'm feeling isolated and unsure of what to do.

1bdjb3s;Lost a friend and no one cares.;Steven_c_w03;Hello, (Anonymous). (20yo M). Just recently few days ago, a friend of mine had commented suicide . After I heard of this, I rushed to my parents home from the gym to ask for support and console me. When I got there, I told them that he died, my father then made things worse by saying in an attitude “Well he probably OD’d or something” after that I went on FB calling him out politely asking for respect. My mother then went on for days after that with laughing emoji gifs saying that I was gossiping about him, Which I took that she was making fun of the death. And Monday she hacked into my google account without my knowledge or consent because she was concerned about my safety. Texting me that “I love you” If they truly loved me, would they not hack into my google? spread crap on Facebook making a clown show of my friends death? I went to 2 counselors on the same day and one pastor, which did not seem to care. I lost a good friend, even without thinking about it. It still controls my life.;Hello, (Anonymous). (20yo M).

1bdb5k7;His Psychiatrist Told Him To Stop All Medications ;;My dad has been on a tough road since late October early November of last year. His deppresion is what started this all. He had stopped taking his medication for a year(told no one, we had no idea, he was doing great) then fell into deppresion after seeing an ex girlfriend.Personally I feel if he didn't keep everything a secret from us till it all built up and he was seeing a therapist he couldve made it through without starting medications again. He always hated being on medication. He felt it never helped him. Since October he has been on numerous medications non of which have worked, he has only been suffering from all of the side effects which has made his mental health and physical health deteriorate. Last week his psychiatrist said he could stop taking all current medications. Clonazepam 0.5mg one tablet by mouth two times daily as needed for anxietyMirtazapine 30mg one tablet nightly Olanzapine 5mg one tablet nightly Lexapro 10mg one tablet dailyHe started the Clonazepam in November or December and stopped taking it this past Saturday. He's been taking the Mirtazapine since January and stopped two weeks ago the Olanzapine since January and the Lexapro since February and stopped taking them a week ago today.I told him to taper off but since his doctor said he could just stop that's what he did. These past 5 days have been hitting him hard first physically now mentally. He thinks he's going to be stuck feeling this way for the rest of his life. He has lost all hope and doesn't see an end to his misery. I'm asking all of you for positive stories, experiences, words of encouragement to show him he is not alone and he will get to that light at the end of this hellish tunnel.;My dad has been on a tough road since late October early November of last year.

I choose Mobile computing but the college faculty and members in general Did not allow us to select it as all the participants included only 8 choose Mobile computing. So they told us to get 50 students or you all with have to go with Cloud. And this is basically a scam but nobody really bothered to raise their voice none of us were good and coding(this coding part won't make sence but at the time all the students were demolarized by few teachers) we could not do anything.Now that the root cause has been explained let me elaborate about my problem.

1bcgyi3;Can't tolerate life rn, seriously need help;OkPerspective7034;"Yesterday I got high to try and go to sleep, and I kept crying thinking about meeting my mum or just a female figure, anyone and just crying to them saying ""I miss you mum, I miss you mum, I forgive you I really need you"" I just need someone, anyone.My mum's been absent from my life for 13 years, I'm 19 I didn't grow up around any women. My dad kicked me out when I was a teen and I ended up in care, I haven't really talked to him since. I have no one, I'm crying in bed right now typing this. I have no one. I really hate myself and my life. About a year ago my dad's dementia got really bad, now he needs 24 hour care. He dosen't even recognise me. He dosen't know what's going on. I'm not even mad at him. I haven't seen him in months.I just really miss my mum and dad I wish they gave me love, I wish I had anyone to love me. I wish I had someone. I wish I had people who care about me in my life. I was kinda fine for a bit, because of my girlfriend. She was my rock. She kept me mentally together. Around mid February she ghosted me, without saying a word. And refused to say anything at all. I cried everyday, stressing out. Kept messaging her saying how sorry I am for everything wrong I've done. She saw how much I suffered. Knew I have really bad abandonment issues and still left me. In my head I wanted to believe the best. I even touch days of work to fly and apologise to her, the plane ticket was $1300, but I didn't care. I was like she has to see how much I'd do for her how much I love her. She didn't I was alone and broke down at the airport terminal, I already made my connecting flight so I couldn't go home, so I just spend 2 days by myself in an Airbnb. 3 weeks in I got my brother (that I'm not that close with) to message her. And she didn't know if you wanted to be with me or not, she was still deciding. But it's like she could've talked to me about it, said something before leaving.

1bcdo6e;Cymbalta with Ritalin for adhd and depression ;KittyLittyy;Recently started Ritalin 20mg 2x a day to help with adhd and chronic fatigue. I’ve been on Vyvanse before as well but didn’t work out for me. Also started Cymbalta/duloxetine (generic) 2 days ago, today is the 3rd dose. Taking it for depression. I’ve tried an antidepressant before that was prescribed as an off label non stimulant for adhd, but reacted badly to it. I haven’t had any side effects or weird symptoms, except for maybe an up and down. I’ll feel good and energized then sluggish/groggy. Haven’t noticed any reactions with Ritalin either so far.I do notice a bit of an intense/overwhelming feeling, not in a bad way. It’s hard to explain, but whenever I yawn or feel sluggish/tired, I think the Cymbalta tries to fight it and uplift my mood. Gives me a big boost of something, like a feel good energy but it’s intense. Also have a bad addiction to caffeine, especially soda. Mostly Mountain Dew and Dr Pepper. I try to cut back and wait for have one at least 6+ hours after I take Cymbalta and in between Ritalin doses. Definitely too early to tell if it’s good or bad.Any experience with Cymbalta and Ritalin or stimulant adhd meds?

I had my other closest friend coming to visit me and well... they hooked up and did some kissing and being close each other next to me (Tried to hide it but lol... Drunk peole ain't quiet when they try kiss). It hurt me... ALOT. Both knew my feelings towards the friend and I were hosting them at my apartment. I had to go away from them and went for other place to sleep night over. Wanted break from both of the friends and asked them leave spare keys to me.

I know that there are probably lots of posts discussing advice that is similar but I can’t seem to think straight enough and feel overwhelmed by the information. My situation is that I am 26F from the UK and I am really struggling mentally. I’ve been clinically depressed for about 10 years, and it seems to just persist through all sorts of different life situations, good and bad. I have arranged to see therapist but not for two more weeks due to appointment scheduling. I’ve been jobless for ages despite having a physics degree from a good university. I feel really helpless and have been trying really hard with little result. I have been trying really hard also to improve my mental health- since the start of the year I have meditated daily, wrote 3 pages of A4 journal daily, taken my recommended fluoxetine every day and even tracked all my moods by the hour on a big spreadsheet to try and notice patterns. Also exercised 3x a week regularly. I’m on jobseekers and try and eat well but I end up spending all my money on transport or coffee (I’m a bit nervous of one of my flatmates and try very hard to not be around him in the house but he’s always in, hence the money for the coffee shop around £4/day every day of week). I’ve been seeing a therapist for about a year and she is good, and yet I still feel low. Any advice?? Much appreciated  P.S.

1bb5v0h;A person on Reddit told me I'm a failure and attention seeker because I haven't succeeded in my suicide attempts. ;iconicpistol;TW: Suicide, suicidal ideation. Last night a person said that people who post about being suicidal are attention seeking. I replied to him that it's not true and said (stupid, I know) that I have tried to off myself several times. He told me that I'm just seeking attention and that I should try a different method. I got banned from that sub for 2 days so I sent him a chat telling him that I am not seeking attention and how awful of a person he is. Apparently nobody cares about me, I'm an idiot, a failure and my breath stinks. His words. And I should go on and kill myself. You know what's the funniest thing? He hasn't been banned from that sub and his comments were still up before I deleted the post. So yeah, fucking good morning to me!

1bayt3d;I love my infant nephew like a son and it's breaking my heart;Toe-Zealousideal;"I've never made a post on reddit about anything. I don't ever really reach out to anyone in my life for help or support when I'm feeling down either. It's very difficult for me to talk about my feelings; it makes me cringe to even consider it, even though I realize it's healthy to be vulnerable with the people I love and care about. It's very hard for me to even write this post. I've had a long, fulfilling relationship with my wife for almost 20 years now. We've been married about 10. I'm 35 years old, and we've never had kids. We tried for awhile in our 20s, but it just never happened. I guess I was sort of relieved. I've always enjoyed the life we have; being able to do what we want, when we want it, that whole thing. Every once in awhile, however, a little thought will hit me. I think of a son, or a daughter that I don't have. I don't think it's painful exactly, but it feels like it could be if I sat with it enough. My sister-in-law just gave birth to her first child, who is currently 3 months old. My sweet wife, who always wanted to be a mother, seems to have come to some sort of peace with being a wonderful, doting nanny. I love my sister-in-law and brother-in-law and I'm deeply impressed by the parents they already are. Today, we spent much of the day with them and the baby. We're all very close and have been really enjoying our time together. I've always been uncomfortable holding babies/children. For one thing, they feel fragile and I don't know how to hold them. But really, I genuinely just have never really liked kids. I don't hate kids, not even close; but I never understood really wanting kids or wanting to be around them.All this changed the instant I first held little ""J"". My wife and sister-in-law teasingly told me I had to hold the baby, and of course you have to hold the new family baby, so I reluctantly took little ""J"" into my arms. My heart melted. My entire world stood still. I felt my heart and breath slow down. I felt a deeper love than I had ever felt before in my life. I wanted to hold him and never stop. Every chance we've had since he's been born, we've been helping with ""J"". It's never felt like a chore.Today was one of the longest days we've had together. It was a wonderful day, but at little moments here and there, I felt a little pulse of sadness. I knew why, but I didn't follow any of the thoughts and just focused on enjoying the afternoon. ""J"" had fallen asleep in my arms for quite awhile, and he woke up very hungry. It was past time for a feeding. I told everyone i needed to run some errands. They were having a good day; sister time.  I smiled and said goodbye. I went straight home and went into the the shower. I collapsed, mentally and physically. I cried until my eyes were swollen and my throat was raw. I howled without any shame in my empty house, my empty life. My poor dogs. ""My son"" was the only thought I could form. Tears welling again as I write this. Thoughts of my life, what could my life even mean, boxing me in. My poor sweet wife; my mother, an angel, a widow, I'm certain desperate for grandchildren; my dead father who I look for every day; my stupid hobbies, books, music, my talents, flaws, nothing of any value without my child who I'll never know. Thinking of the child I love, who could have been mine, in another life. Thinking of the baby I just held that I had to hand over, feeling so much for 30 perfect minutes like my own.";I've never made a post on reddit about anything.

I thought he could honestly be the one for me. Just being around him instantly put me in a better mood, we never fought, we liked so much of the same things, we could talk for hours, I never connected with someone like I did with him and I started to fall for him. Then last night I found out this whole time he has still been on dating apps and I’m heart broken, it feels like it hurts worse than when my years long relationships ended because in those I knew it was coming. But this was so sudden I didn’t see this coming and it’s like someone kicked me in the stomach and I cannot stop crying no matter how much I tell myself I’ll be fine. I of course ended things with him out of self respect but I miss him so so much, so badly I want to call him and go be with him and pretend like I didn’t see what I did. I feel like the only thing that would make me feel better would be to curl up hug him and cry on his chest despite it being him who hurt me so bad.

When I confronted them, I admit I lost my temper.  Now they have convinced my wife that I am abusive, and many people believe this (including wife).  I have never hit her, and I don't believe any of our arguments have crossed the line from a ""normal"" argument into abusiveness.  They are mandating I seek professional help, and I believe this is their way of deflecting blame from their theft onto my mental health.  I am about to lose everything and I feel completely trapped.

1batuwb;Am I depressed or simply a quitter?;No-Preparation7031;"My educational journey has taken quite a diverse path, ranging from a bachelor's degree in classics to obtaining a GIS degree and now actively pursuing a civil engineering degree. Despite the challenges I faced with my current college, I finally committed to the civil engineering program in January, and the initial excitement was palpable. However, a sense of unease has gradually crept in since mid-February, casting a shadow over my enthusiasm.I once had a deep passion for GIS, urban planning, and voracious reading of literature. Lately, though, no book seems to captivate me, and doubts about the significance of my degree have started to overshadow my academic pursuits. The persistent question, ""What's the point?"" echoes in my mind.   Despite putting in considerable effort in my early professional career, working full-time and attending classes at night feels like a futile endeavor. I often feel like a fish out of water, and the exhaustion has become overwhelming. Yesterday, it dawned on me that perhaps my struggles go beyond mere difficulty or laziness when my therapist suggested the possibility of depression and recommended a return to antidepressants. While part of me feels a sense of relief, realizing that it may not be a simple case of laziness, I'm apprehensive about the potential continuation of this feeling of futility even if I embark on medication or pursue treatments like TMS.

1b9stzv;How to STOP Nervousness EFFECTIVELY;ParadigmShift007;Nervousness is something we all experience at various points in our lives. Whether it’s before a big presentation, a job interview, or a social event,I remember one time I had to give a speech in front of my whole class. I was so nervous, I couldn’t even say my name. And That’s how powerful nervousness can be.You might already know some common ways to deal with nervousness, like taking deep breaths, chewing gum, or thinking positively.But while finding a better solution on how I can overcome nervousness, I found a great  research study on the neuroscience of Visualization.Now, you might be wondering, how can visualization help with nervousness?You see, Visualization is the process of creating mental images or pictures in one’s mind. It involves using sensory information and the imagination to simulate experiences and situations that feel real despite not being physically present. And research has shown that the brain often can’t tell the difference between a visualized image and actual reality. This means that when you visualize a specific action or outcome, the same areas of your brain are activated as when you actually perform that action.If you want to have a better understanding on how visualization helps to overcome nervousness, I have created an animated video to share what I learned.If you prefer reading, I have included important reference links below.I hope you find this informative. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it!Cheers!;Nervousness is something we all experience at various points in our lives.

1b9p1ip;I need someone to tell me they understand me, please ;NoRent7336;No one understands mental ilness stuff in my environments. I do have to show up to school but i am stuck of thinking about my explanation. I did tell my english teacher i have depression months ago but my parents said i am just lazy. 19years old btw(undergrad). And i do have other mental illness struggles like anxiety, selfharm, agoraphobia, MDD and BodyDysmorphia. But my parents never really cared or believed me that i am mentally sick. They tell me i am not a crazy person therefore cant let me go to a psychologist or any kind of it. Whenever i mention the school counselors EVERY YEAR(i changed schools like 4 times) that i have depression they usually dont know what it means(i dont blame them most people are religious and they believe the people who gives up on themselves are selfish and go to hell so we dont even have a suicide hotline and i am sure i would call them every week if we had a line..) or why cant i basically wash up every 3 days and come to school just like every kid? They will never understand that the reason i am at my bed for 12 hours everyday isnt because i enjoy sleeping. It feels like torture to try your best and no one fking sees it. My agoraphobia definitely is created by my depression over the years. I stayed at home more than half my life for sure and depression made me appreciate every little thing in life brings happiness: birds chipping, smell after rain, whenever kids tell their jokes to you, whenever someone you dont even know is kind to you..i could write a whole book about these and how beautiful it felt even when i was the most miserable, but now its different, i cant see life the same its like my depression evolved into agoraphobia(afraid of going outside basically) and i am only filled with fear and regret. It seems like i am coming to an end but i have to stay alive cuz i dont want my parents to think i deserved to go to hell or anything, i just need to hear someone tell me they understand me, i just wished that someone would see that i am trying my best, i am not a lazy teen :( i swear.;No one understands mental ilness stuff in my environments.

1b9n87h;I am not normal;Excellent_Base63;I am 18 now and I have wasted my 3 years of life 14-17 age doing bullshit when I was 14 I started seeing disturbing movies which are way spine chilling creepier bloody X-rated than normal horror movies at such kind age those movies were banned from the countries and I wasted my time seeing them living in isolation where all other people were spending their time playing online games with each other talking to each other I was doing all this this was during lockdwon . Then at my age 15 I came to know about philosophy and I use to waste my time on it which is used to see in phone I never went outside at this time I completely isolated myself from the world thinking I have live in my own world. It felt very good at that time. Also I wasted all my time in phone watching philosophy movie reviews movie analysis deep lore game reviews instead of playing games and watch those movies. How to be better than as I was very competative how to be a genius like Albert Einstein how to be prefect like Leonardo da vinci and many more. Then from 16-17 I lowered down the philosophy part keeping movies review analysis constant then I shifted my thinking in people birthday analysis how birthday determines your overall personality then I would compare of people which I thought were better than me . I also started writing analysis of people. And till now I have literally wasted all my time on all this . I am very boring person whenever I try to talk to others they think I am a negative person because I talk in deep with others I cannot make jokes like they in mid the conversations due to this I have no friends that why since childhood I had very few friends and now I am 18 I have none. I have no creativity in me. I am not that straight forward person. I don't even know who I am.  I am too much competative I compare every aspect of Me every little detail of others to myself. I have literally every bad qualities in me  And there much more complex things very deep confusing things happening my life I were to tell you you would call me mad . And all this is increasing everyday as age is passing. Iam too old for my age. Even the people I attract are very toxic and I want to hangout with those happy ones outgoing normal people. Now I don't feel innocent when something bad happens I am first noticing it others take it very lightly like we used to do when we are kid. I am very concious of things happening around me. Also I sometimes I am very happy and at an instant I am too much sad like I am in depression. I want to be those normal people who are neither too much sad not too much happy those realistic people. I don't why I want to make my life complicated while my heart says to keep it simple like it used to be in childhood. I am sick of myself why am I like this I wasted all my childhood on all this never did what I was supposed to do in those days I don't want to live . I am not normal like others I feel very different when I am with people people always see as very different from people of the group they kind of merge with each and I am always left out I don't want to live like this and are many deep deep things in me my life which are not normal I want to become normal why am I like this please anybody help me;I am 18 now and I have wasted my 3 years of life 14-17 age doing bullshit when I was 14 I started se;REQUESTING SUPPORT;2;3;2024-03-08 12:53:09;2024-03-08;Friday;12:53:09;3242;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:52.534987

I never know how to get back up from these bad points.I’ve just got to stop being a monster. I’m scared of losing my partner and I don’t want to hurt him or affect him.

1b8hgmd;Just want to share something that really helps me day to day;ChamomilePeppermint;I call it my “house bag”!It’s basically a big bag with lots of compartments, meant for crafting and storing art supplies etc., but I instead fill it with all of the things I need for day to day life.I take the bag all around the house with me and I have done for years - it’s with me when I go to bed, and I bring it back downstairs when I get up.I can’t even explain how helpful this has been. I do feel a bit strange for doing it, as I’ve not seen similar online anywhere (not that this matters!!), but having all my toiletries, medications, small electronics etc. to hand helps me so much when I either can’t get out of bed or can’t get off the sofa.It also gives me so much flexibility, as I can decide to, for example, take my makeup off and put my deodorant on whilst I’m on the sofa, rather than having to go to the bathroom to do it, which means I have to take one less step before going to bed. These are all things that help me live around my depression symptoms.An example of some of the things I keep in my house bag!Deodorant, Medication and vitamins, Headphones, Handcream, Moisturisers, serums and SPF, Makeup remover, Waterless toothbrushes and floss sticks, Cotton buds and rounds, Glasses cleaning cloth, Mini desk fan, Hand cream, PlastersI really hope this helps someone :) (wish I could post a pic to show you my bag!);I call it my “house bag”!It’s basically a big bag with lots of compartments, meant for crafting and ;PROVIDING ADVICE;5;9;2024-03-07 01:23:41;2024-03-07;Thursday;01:23:41;1339;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-20 21:04:52.585180

The last 2 years of my life I spent with a diagnosed sociopath who abused me, pressured me into taking drugs and separated me from my friends to the point where I don't even know how to communicate/connect appropriately with anyone anymore. I don't go to college (I did for a semester and almost died there), I can't hold a job because I'm so depressed. I don't have any money to go out and do things. I want to take art classes but I don't have the money to get involved in the community. I'm so damn lonely. Even if I had friends, the job I just got hired for would be a hard schedule to work around so I wouldn't get to hang out. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about ending it. The only thing that's stopping me so far is that I really hate not tying up loose ends. I would need to give the people around me (my family, online friends) closure.

1b82cbz;I feel lost. ;Artistic_Bug2417;I inexplicably decided to download Reddit, find this subreddit and just rant about my life issues which I am hesitant to share with my close ones. I am a graduation student currently in the second year, fourth semester exams are coming next month and.. I feel lost.   The thing is, I am 80% blind, I don't know how I pushed through school to reach graduation through the system for normal students rather than special school but I feel that I have reached a point where I can't take it anymore, it's too difficult. I don't know what to do, it's hard for me to study because I can't see properly, if I need to write I have to bend over so much that my nose almost touches the notebook, this naturally pains my back and neck and so my stamina is very low. I failed in 3 subjects until now and now I must clear them otherwise the year will be lost, but I don't know how. No matter how much I try, I just can't do it. Before the exams next month, I have to write home assignments and project journal but it takes ages for me to write and the whole process is just very troublesome. I managed to do two subjects out of 7 but that alone took me 3-4 days. I feel like dropping out because I'm having suicidal thoughts, I can't bare the pressure.. But.. If I don't graduate then how will I get employment in future when I'm already disabled? At one hand it's proving to be very difficult for me to graduate and on the other hand I feel like without that degree I have no hope In the future. This has plunged me into depression and I truly don't know what to do. If only I had normal eyesight, but that's unfortunately not the case. I feel like I have no future at all, constant anxiety is killing me. How will I get a job? Will I be able to support my parents in their old age?

1b7cu7q;I gave myself 7 days, this is day 6;Primary_Breakfast_77;For the past few months I’ve been suicidal. I asked for professional help, I got out of the hospital even worse. I have lost all hope in life, all pleasure and all motivation. My suicidal ideation started getting worse so I told my family, but they only understood when I almost attempted last night. Before ending my life I made a deal with myself, I gave myself a week to try and make things a little bit better. I started reconnecting with friends, going out to have fun, leaving the house everyday, doing my makeup and tried to lose part of the weight I put on because of depression. I’m also anorexic and bulimic, (right now at a normal BMI because I binged so much to soothe my suicidal thoughts). I tried so hard. I reached out for help. I tried to push myself and every single activity I did the last week was enjoyable— but I felt miserable and in agony all the time. I don’t want to die but I achieved nothing in this week. Nothing got better. A big part of why I want to die is because I feel no pleasure in anything and I gained 4 kgs, I lost my friends, my job, my career, missed all my exams and ruined my future because of being so depressed. It sounds stupid, but my eating disorder is really bad and gaining weight and having no hope that I’ll lose it makes me want to die. I was going to therapy until I had a really bad day and my only hope was my appointment, but my therapist forgot about our appointments and she’s booked until 12th of march. I don’t want to die but it doesn’t feel like a choice anymore. It feels like the only choice I have is to end it all. Soon it will be day 7. I’m really afraid I’m going to die and I’m thinking about how I’m going to ruin my little sister’s life forever. I’m really scared I’m going to do it, because I’ve been feeling so bad I really don’t see another way. I can’t make it through today, I’m in agony and have been for the past few months. I would go to sleep but I have insomnia and can’t sleep at night. I don’t even know why I’m writing this, I just don’t want to destroy my little sister;For the past few months I’ve been suicidal.

I’m tired of it all. I’m tired of living. Im tired of trying. I’m tired of being tired…I’m tired of “being”. I’m just done. Like I just don’t have the energy, or the will, or the desire to go on anymore. Maybe it’s burnout, maybe it’s remnants of a midlife crisis, maybe it’s a mixture of shame and regret and failure…or my own existential dread…but I just want to be done with all of it. Like not just “cash in my chips and go live alone somewhere”…not “I need a break”…not even “end things”. I just want to not exist anymore. I want to have never existed…never been born.

A phrase that implies the existence of success…a glimmer of hope…the possibility for change. But I don’t even feel like a failure. I don’t even feel.

1b6wpfw;Can anyone relate?;Embarrassed-Bet7341;I’m a 26 year old female who, all things considered, should be extremely happy. I have a great life and am extremely blessed to have all that I do. Some backstory: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 11 and put on meds. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression, pretty bad at times, but have always gotten by and usually I felt better by the next day. The last year or two, but especially lately, I’ve felt like I’m going crazy. My anxiety and depression are constantly at an all time high, and I feel like I’m having a giant panic attack from the moment I wake up. My depression has also been way worse than ever before, and I don’t know how to cope with everything. I’ve been at my job now about six months and feel like such an idiot and annoyance every day. People aren’t mean to me, but no one really likes me much or goes out of their way to talk to me. I don’t blame them, though- I’m extremely awkward and quiet at work. I feel so dumb and I’m not confident enough in myself or my skills/work to talk to people, as they’re all more experienced. I feel completely in over my head. I’n taking insurance classes through the company and can’t seem to retain any info and have failed two exams. I’m petrified to tell my job. Besides work, I talk to my parents often. I always call first, and lately I can feel that I’m annoying them. I feel like they try to get off the phone pretty quick, which hurts. I have three older siblings, who I also typically reach out to first. Or, they reach out when they need a favor. I don’t know how to explain it, but I just feel like such a burden and inconvenience to everyone I interact with. I used to be so confident, and now I isolate and stay quiet because I hate myself. I have to be such a disappointment to my friends and family. I feel so guilty staying around when I’m just sad and anxious and cause more stress than joy. I’ve spent so long now researching all the different ways I could end things, and I’ve written so many goodbye letters. I’ve looked myself dead in the eye in the mirror and swore to myself that I’d end things- for myself, and for those around me. It really feels best, long-term. I’m terrified of the pain, of failing, and of disappointing people more than I already have. I thought about overdosing on beta blockers and antidepressants, but apparently it’s pretty rare to actually OD. Every time I’m driving alone, I think about driving off a bridge or under a semi. But apparently, that’s not usually that successful, either. And it’s all so selfish- I can’t stand to think about the person/people who would have to find my body, deal with possible trauma, etc. I don’t know… the idea of continuing to live this way scares me more than the opposite. Am I going crazy? Can anyone relate to what I’m saying/how I’m feeling? Is it wrong for me to ask for… successful ways to go? I don’t have any plans, but am really feeling like I’ve overstayed my time here.;I’m a 26 year old female who, all things considered, should be extremely happy.

1b6bwv2;I have amnesia from overdosing and I can't get over it;FlimsyOrchid6508;"About three years ago I tried to kill myself by overdosing on antidepressants and various other medications such as painkillers, antibiotics, analgesics, and pretty much everything I could find. I was rushed to the hospital and was about five minutes away from death. Instead, I ended up in a coma. When I woke up, I couldn't remember what had happened. I was told what happened that night, but I can't remember it myself. After I was discharged from the hospital, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital because my family didn't know how to deal with me. I stayed there for three months, and there's a lot that I can't remember about that either. Most people tell me that it's normal and that I should ""move on"", but I can't. Something about not being able to remember makes me anxious and it's eating me up. I have the same issue with most part of my childhood, and it took a long time to come to terms with that. But this, I just know there's something I need to remember, and I can't stop thinking about it. But if I don't, I can't move on and heal, and that hurts.

At the beginning I had hope for the future, thinking that it would turn out later in life but it has been 4 months and my hope has gone down. I get bullied by my friends(I say friends because we have fun moments together).I've got such a horrible life and honestly, i think i deserve it, my grades are average, i have no good skill, i have little to no achievemens. I had a plan for killing myself, which involved me getting a knife and killing myself on stage in front of everybody and before that I would say ""thanks for all the memories together"". My psychologist says that there is bulling at home too, which I somehow don't understand. I used to listen to $uicideboy$, because I found comfort in them, but stopped because my parents told me to stop listening to them as they changed my thinking, but my psychologist said that this was good for me as i knew how too communicate my feelings thru music lyrics. Music was the only thing that kept me going. I can't even listen to that anymore. My psychologist also doesn't know how to help me. I dont even know how to help myself. He says one thing tho, thats school and home is not a safe place for me, but then a few sessions later, he just made a letter saying that going back to school is a good idea for me. I dont consider myself as good looking, i have no close friends to talk to, and i come from a household where feelings aren't much talked about. I dont know if my god like me? I want a girlfriend, who is going thru smthn similar as me, but i am to afraid to love or see how my parents react. I don't understand. I don't know what to do.

I've been dealing with constant (very high) highs and (very low) lows and I can't do it anymore. The doctors won't prescribe me with any medication to aid because I overdosed on my prescription. I've been feeling really good these past few weeks, i've been laughing, smiling and going on walks with family. I haven't genuinely laughed or smiled in ages and it truly felt good. But now I feel like i'm below rock bottom and I don't know where I went wrong. I can't leave the bed, I can't even brush my teeth. I've gone weeks without showering, my clothes stink. It's so bad there's been days when my sibling would physically have to carry me to the bathroom just so I can use the toilet because I don't have the energy. I can't do anything, my family won't let me out of the house on my own because of my recent attempt and have even gone as far as installing a doorbell camera to see if/when I leave the house. I've been job searching for almost 2 years now and I'm still unemployed due to my autism and the severe anxiety I get with interviews. I am thousands in debt with no way to pay it off and the interest keeps building everyday. I'm genuinely lost in life and don't see the point anymore.

While I really think I do this just to ""skip"" the day, sometime I really feel I need to sleep, but I'm still tired, naps or not. My naps are 2-4 hours long, I barely do anything during the day even if I improved in that point (I can work a bit when I'm not in class).I don't know what to do, I tried small naps (20-30min longs) to just have some energy but I feel like it's useless.As for my night, I sleep between 7 and 9h long, I have a pretty good sleep I guess.I don't know what to do, I do not have any energy, maybe it's depression, I don't know.

1b5k8ye;Lost family and friends after being cheated on. ;Overall_Albatross_30;Hi folks. I immigrated to Canada 10 years ago, trying to get a better life and for the most part I did. Despite struggling with mental health mostly due to the distance of family and friends life adjusted after a few years. On my 7th year I felt completely alone, I have devoting kind of spirit so I help people as much as I can and always offer to assist with  settling newcomers as I know the struggles they might face. It is true when people say that we do to other what we miss for ourselves and despite helping others for years I was never helped myself. I’ve found someone from my home country and we estartes a relationship from the distance, I moved cities as to give her and myself better opportunities and cheaper cost of living, I helped her improve her career, English and was always supportive emotionally and financially. We visited each other several times and I grew attached to her family, in some ways more than to my own. Yet 1 month before the marriage she faulted and cheated on my, both families devastated, everyone side with me as they realized the psychological stress that gave me, specially when once you discover the cheating your head dwells on questions without answer (who, since when). I had mental struggles from the past and now I felt completely abandoned, betrayed, like someone not deserving of anything. I have made a rule for my relationships to never yell or fight but rather always open communications and try to dialogue whatever ones is unhappy about. I felt into depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lost 40lbs in a month. I reached for support from both sides of the family and for 2 months I was assisted in some ways, but now 3 months after what happened everyone is gone, her side of the family no longer cares about what happened, my family thinks I should just raise my head and continue going to work as if nothing ever happened. My friends stopped texting or calling me and when I try to interact with them they ignore. 3 months ago I had friends and two families, plans for having kids and buying a house, I’ve finally thought I had found someone with enough people on my life that I could wish for. I ended up loosing my job because of my diminished perfomance. It has been 2 weeks since I spoke to someone or someone spoke to me, my psychologist is on maternity leave and my psychiatrist medication isn’t working. I am completely on my own day after day with no friends I started talking to myself in my apartment, most of the time self conscious that I am going crazy, sometimes I just walk around the apartment for hours with a stale look. I lost desire for anything and think about taking my life several times every, day so much so that I decided that carbon poisoning will be the best choice as I will just sleep. I got to a point I have nowhere to go to or do and depleted my calls for help. I am completely afraid that one day during one of my panics attacks I might do something without realizing it until is too late.;Hi folks.

1b5gkos;Why am I alive?;smoothbrain_1947;"Edit: I AM NOT GOING TO KILL MYSELFI apologize for making people think that I was going to commit suicide, I now realize that the title makes it sound like I am going to kill myself but I am probably not going to kill myself unless something really bad happens. You don't need to be concerned about me.It seems that life is just unfathomably fucked. We kill 80+ billion chickens every year after keeping them in horrible conditions just so we have access to these slabs of flesh that we cook and eat mostly for no other reason than enjoying the taste. Life kills, tortures, it rapes, violates and mutilates at an unimaginable scale, and we are not in any way exempt from being the ones who do it and being the ones on the receiving end of it.So you know... it's just shit. It's not bullshit. This is not a game; the pain is real. It's just horrible, and anyone who thinks otherwise is simply delusional.You can't change it, you can't cope with it, you can't let go. There is no escape. Maybe death is an escape, and I sincerely hope that our deaths are final. That's why I will always have a way out.There is no psychological or philosophical way to cope with this. Not for me.We can try to ignore it. Let's narrow down the scope for example. We can justify this action by making the observation that we are not gods; we are not all powerful and all knowing. There is a limit to what we can do to help, and most of the time we can't even do much to help ourselves. Our resources are limited, and it might be a good idea to start by helping ourselves first.Except I can't do that either. I am a disturbed person, in many ways. My attempts to change that has failed. My attempts to cope with it has also failed. There is no way to let go, because you might as well kill yourself. No escape, you are stuck, and you are hurting. No amount of thinking, reading, philosophy or psychology helps. You can try to change your life style, but you always end up exactly where you start. Everything is under an acid rain, any kind of meaning, purpose, reason to stay alive, your habits, things that make you happy, your hobbies, connections that you build, your motivation, any small piece of discipline you try to build around that, they all get eroded. No structure can be built. It all disintegrates.I am not saying that it's impossible. It just doesn't seem possible for me. I don't know why.I also do not believe that I am the one who needs to find that meaning, because all attempts to do so lead me to the exact opposite. I am tired of doing it and at this point it just sounds like bullshit.I also don't get how someone can embrace the meaninglessness, I have no idea what it means and how it makes even the slightest bit of sense. Again, sounds like total bullshit.Like I said, no way to change it, no way to embrace it, no way to let go of it and no way to cope with it. No escape. You are just fucked. You will try to do something and it will fail, again and again and again, yet you will keep trying because that's what pain is. It calls you to action; the very purpose of pain is being something that you can't live with. You will take action and it will fail. Nothing works and you know nothing will work but you are miserable and you will keep trying. Good luck.";Edit: I AM NOT GOING TO KILL MYSELFI apologize for making people think that I was going to commit su;TW: Intense Topics;4;3;2024-03-03 12:57:18;2024-03-03;Sunday;12:57:18;3264;Reddit;depression_help;depression_help;2024-04-19 13:29:06.119699

I usually wipe my armpits with a wet cloth (because i dont even have the strenght to take off my shirt, thats why sometimes i keep wet paper near my bed too) and then pass this product that its like a cream.Dudes.

1b4lfvn;"Is it possible to ""cure"" depression? And if not, then why do I no longer qualify for a depression diagnosis?";Caitm8911;"I don't really know where to ask this, but I've been thinking about it lately and I'm unsure of of answer. Asking a professional would probably be a better option, but I don't see my therapist anymore so I don't really have anyone to ask.Anyways, when I was younger (ages ~9-15) I was really depressed. It was much worse at the younger ages, but it was still there as I got older. I was never diagnosed with anything at that time because I was scared. But I'm 99% sure I would have been diagnosed with depression. I finally saught help when I turned 16, and it took about 6 months until I got my diagnosis. I have social anxiety disorder. But I do still have some depressive symptoms. I wonder if it's possible that I could still have depression or if I've been ""cured"" or something. Though I don't think that's possible. I don't want to jinx it, but I haven't had a major depressive episode since last year in February. I've been taking anti-depressants for my anxiety since around April 2023 and my depressive episode stopped around July. Or it at least got better. I think it's like been a lot better since maybe August. But like, I feel like I still might have depression, despite not being officially diagnosed and despite not having all symptoms (like negative self talk, loss of appetite, loss of interest in hobbies). Like they happen sometimes, but not as often as they used to. And I feel like that's just because I've found useful coping mechanisms and because of my medication. But again, I've never been officially diagnosed so I could be incredibly wrong, although when I was particularly ""bad"", I'm convinced I would've been diagnosed with some form of depression at least. I don't really know how to explain my thoughts. I guess, is it possible I'm ""cured"" or maybe I still have depression or maybe I never did? I don't know what to think.My symptoms when I was younger was basically all the typical depression symptoms (like if you were to look them up i guess?). I was bullied and felt stupid and that no one loved me. I was suicidal and often wouldnt eat or do anything I enjoyed, amongst other things. I dont remember a lot of those years because they were quite traumatic (some unfortunate events happened), but I do know I was not doing well and I'm surprised my dad never said anything. But I mean, Ive been getting better over the past few years. I think this is the best I've felt in a while, though I still kind of feel like shit.

So I’m not just sitting home with nothing to do. I work two part time jobs so sometimes I have a full day off or half day it depends on my schedule. She just recently got a part time job twice a week. I was off yesterday which was her first day working so I was home alone till work me and the dog it was okay I was a little bored but I did go run some errands shopping for a little. But today I’m working a late shift again so I’m home until then since I don’t really have any where to go. I guess I just fell into the routine of her always being home when she retired because before retirement I was at school or local community college while she worked her other job and never home alone unless it was like an hour or two. But now she’s not home and I’m here for hours before work I just feel so alone and that my daily routine kinda changed the days she is working I hate change it just makes my mental health go haywire. And I’ve been crying pretty much all day today it sucks. I feel like I’m a little kid crying at stupid stuff when their mom drops them off at school and if tell anyone they would make fun of me for why I’m so upset and just tell me to grow up. I shouldn’t be this way but it’s just so hard with depression and anxiety. I had to vent about it! If you’re in this same situation I’d love any advice you have!

What helped with your depression when you saw things differently?;Baby_yoghurt;Personally I have thought my whole life that I was the absolute worst person to ever have set foot on this planet. Literally. I truly always believed this. Lately I’ve tried to think more rationally, and I I’ve realized that it can’t possibly be true. I might not be the best, but I can’t possibly be the worst ever(even though I feel like it). So this made me realize that maybe many of these depressive thoughts I have about myself is a lie that I’ve told my self for my whole life and that’s the reason I believe them. Not because they are true.

She didn't listen much or I could describe much but she prescribed medication.Now I am fearful that if I am on medication I will have many side effects and I heard that sex drive is reduced by meds, I already have it on lower end and only sexual encounter with a girl has not been very well.So I am asking if meds will do more worse?

1b3pqv0;I don't want to be like this anymore!;Sgt_Phantomizer;Where to even begin? I don't even know that much, but I guess beginning somewhere Is a start.I (m34) believe I may have ADHD and as a by product of It, depression which I've been told Is common with people that have ADHD, before I say anymore, I'll try and list some reasons why I feel that I might have ADHD along with why I'm posting here.I procrastinate, to an extent, uncontrollably and I DON'T KNOW WHY.As the years have gone by, I've found It harder and harder to concentrate. At work, I often have to take out my phone and check my notifications, like compulsively. At home, I'll usually play video games every night and no matter what I play, no matter how much fun I'm having, I find myself constantly pausing to check my phone or scroll fb/twitter/reddit/etcWork doesn't fare much better, I have to do things a certain way In order to satisfy my brain, even If It's to the detriment of productivity, thankfully It's not a HUGE problem, but my life would be SO MUCH BETTER If I could just do things as efficiently as possible.Back to the bit about procrastinating. I'm a relatively clean person, like I'll clean up after myself most of the times, but there are exceptions and they bother the ever living hell out of me, yet I can't be bothered to take care of them...if that makes sense? Like the counter top where my coffee maker sits on, I've been telling myself that I should clean it, that I NEED to clean It for weeks now, but I somehow can't bring myself to do It. or that cereal bowl that sit's on my desk until my day off from work.Even If I generally know what I want to do, I'll still just.....do nothing. There are days that I just come home, shower and than doom scroll twitter for 3 or 4 hours, before realizing that I wasted my night and that I should go to sleep.I find It extremely difficult to get out of bed on most days. I do It because I have responsibilities, but I'll take any opportunity or excuse to go back to sleep, or just stay In bed longer. I usually have fairly decent control of myself In this regard, but I'm not perfect and I have called off from work a few times over the years, simply because of this.I've been like this for almost as long as I can remember, though It's just worsened over the years. Last year, my wife convinced me to finally go to the doctor. Bloodwork all came back normal, except for an Indication that I had gallstones In my gallbladder, which was backed up by a CT Scan. I mentioned the whole feeling tired/fatigued to my doctor and they didn't really think too much of it and referred me to a psychiatrist, which I than proceeded to look up online, saw a few bad reviews and noped out of It. I've tried taking several supplements over the years, Vitamin B, D, L-Thirosine and something else that I can't remember the name of.I feel my quality of life just keeps tanking and I don't know how to even take a step In the right direction. Work completely drains me and life Is monotonous, but that latter half Is partially my own fault as well.I'm sorry If this whole post Is completely and utterly all over the place.;Where to even begin?

1b3nkxg;I don't know what to do;MellowDawn47971;The Grammer is going to be bad and spelling worse. It's 12:13 am on March 1st and I've been sobbing for at least an hour. This is my first post on reddit as far as i can remember and my first time reaching out to strangers for some kind of help.I want to die but I don't want to kms and it's the worst feeling in the world. Not having the strength to pull myself out of these holes I keep falling in and getting out of. These episodes are getting more frequent and I feel like I'm completely losing it rn.Growing is horrible especially when your life practically hasn't even started. I'm only 16 and might be to young for some of this shit but I'm so done. Being raised by a teen mom was better then having Nothing even if I'm realizing my mom grew up with me and were both horrible because of it. I'm disgusting because I was raist by a child who was still learning to clean herself so how could she teach another child. I wanted to be better for her to grow up and experience things that she didn't get to like she wanted. Even if now I'm living for myself I still want that but the cost of doing so is wearing me out.Having a learning disability sucks anywhere but of course I live in Texas, a state where they couldn't give less of a shit about bratty teens like me. I can't understand anything in my English class because of my dyslexia and it's going to be my end. Sure let me ask my teacher who has admitted to encourage kids to kill themselves if they said they wanted to. I surrounded by horrible people in a broken world and I can't to anything about it. I want to live and be a nurse and have a life with a house of my own but that is possibly not likely to ever happen. I don't care if you have to suffer to succeed what does it matter is succeeding in only one step and suffering is falling into a dark hole that you want to swallow you. I know I'm contradicting myself but I look at my future and sometimes I just see this dark void and sometimes I wish it'd come sooner.I've been listening to a playlist this whole time and it's 12:27 on March 1st of 2023.

I’ve been here before, many times, but every time I’ve managed to pull myself out of it, but it only lasts a few weeks or so, and then I’m right back at the start again. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a very emotional intelligent person, but when it comes to myself, I can’t help myself. I know my limits, but I chose to ignore them and I don’t know how to stop. I’ve completely lost myself, I don’t know who I am anymore, I have many friends but with every friend, I’m a different person, and I’m not sure which one is actually me. I guess in a sense, they’re all me, but when I’m alone, and am trying to understand myself and who I am, I’m never able to come to a conclusion. I know things that I like doing, but then I feel like I convince myself that I only like these things to seem like someone else, so I don’t know if I actually like them, so when I try to distract myself by doing something that I “like” it hardly works because I’m unsure if I actually find joy in it.Idk why I’m here, Ig I just wanna say shit and write it all out, I want help and I need help but I know that I can’t accept it.;I’ve brought myself back into a phase of doing drugs to cope with every minor inconvenience.
