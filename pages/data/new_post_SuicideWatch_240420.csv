1c90k12;Am I better off just ending things before I end up being an evil person? (TW: sexual abuse);My-alt-for-sh-posts;I'm not in danger, this post is not urgentI recently found out my dad is a sex offender and then just today found out that statistically I'm likely to end up like that as well Obviously I could never do something like that and even the idea disgusts me but I can't help worrying that that's what a sex offender would think as well?What if I'm destined to end up doing something horrible? Surely sex offenders don't grow up knowing they're going to do something like that?Is it better for me to just kms now rather than risk potentially one day ruining someone's life?

1c8yam2;How Much Do Parents Care?;throwaway19399192;I’m a daughter of two strict Asian parents who care only about looks, grades, and money. Unfortunately, I am ugly, my grades aren’t good, and I still live at home because I don’t make enough to support myself. My mum constantly berates me about my looks and my grades. She says I am better off dead because I am too ugly for a husband and I don’t have good enough grades to be successful. She acts ashamed when talking to her friends, avoids talking about me and only talks about my brothers because they are all handsome and successful. My father does nothing to stop these comments and sometimes agrees with my mum. He’s very distant with me and we don’t talk often. So I have no one to turn to for reassurance or guidance. My mum acts like a narcissist, while my father is just absent altogether. There was one time my mum was so cruel about my appearance that I had finally cracked, locked myself in my bathroom, and cut my arms so deep. Only for her to yell at me a day later for getting blood on my sheets because they leaked through my bandages (I had to pretend it was menstrual blood). My father comforted me a little during this time because I felt like I needed to talk to someone or I would kill myself, but he did so in his awkward lack of affection way. As if I was just inconveniencing him and thought this would be the quickest way for me to go away. I honestly don’t think they would care much once I am gone. They already have perfect sons, getting rid of their faulty daughter would relieve them of this burden. I put shame on the family for just existing and never living up to anyone’s expectations. I feel like I failed as a daughter. Are there other people who have parents who act like this? I have tried to find stories of strict parents’ reactions to their children’s suicides (Guilt/Sadness/Happy) but it seems taboo for them to talk about publicly. So I haven’t found much online. Does anyone have any personal experience about how these types of parents reacted when their child committed suicide?;I’m a daughter of two strict Asian parents who care only about looks, grades, and money.

1c8y5l5;Came to terms with it. If I don't get into uni I am doing it.;silakkakaakao;I had a good run, I guess. Not really, but I did some good things, I hope. I just know I can't promise myself even a crumb of a comfortable existence if I don't make it to uni this time around. Psychology is so difficult to get into here, it's laughable. Considering all the budget cuts to education it's probably gonna be even more difficult. My memory sucks and it's the only thing tested in the exam. If I don't get into any university for psychology I might as well just end it, I've been thinking about it for like a month now already. It just makes sense. I can't find a job despite sending hundreds of applications over the past year and my physical and mental condition is just deteriorating. There kinda is no point.Usually writing this I am super emotional but I am just kind of okay. Maybe a bit hopeful, actually. This way, no matter if I pass or don't pass, I just kind of win. If I get into uni (unlikely unless all the other applicants are absolute cretins) then great, I study psychology and get into a field that doesn't completely make me depressed and makes some decent money. Wish acting did the same but hey, gotta love this economic system. If I don't get in, that's also good, cause I finally get to shed the trauma and pain and finally just rest. I've yet to find a way to do it as guns are very difficult to get here, and knowing my mentally unstable ass I won't be getting any permits anytime soon. I have about 2 months to think on it, surely living in a big city could guarantee me at least a couple ways of getting outta here.Honestly only thing that might turn me back is my overthinking, but I think I can distract myself.

1c8y4uo;I'm worried about my younger brother and don't know how to support him;annnna_19;Hello, I'm not English so sorry about any mistakes. I'm also using a false account because I don't want anyone I know finding this.So I'm barely 18 and finishing highschool. I have my exams in less than 2 months and I really don't know how to support my brother while dealing myself with high stress.My brother is in his second year of middle school. He is considered HPE (High potential in Emotions) so he has been dealing with some breakdows in tears when he doesn't know how to deal with his emotions even if seeing a psychologist has really helped him and us understand how to best respond to those breakdowns and how to avoid them.He has friends that are close to him, I don't really think he was bullied through there was a guy that did bother him a bit but he has been punished by the school and he is being watched so he doesn't do any of it again. I was in the same middle school and I know they really stress students to do well. But a teacher in particular has completely disgusted him of Spanish (that is what she taught) and even school. Most students hate her but even when they said something, she didn't change or anything. She has a system where when students answer, if they are wrong she will say False and all of the rest of the students must repeat it. I get along well with my brother and often, people say that I'm like a little mother to him and I find it true for some things like his emotional needs. He often comes to me when he finds himself overwhelmed or when he had a breakdown. When he has a problem or something important to say, he will come to me first before going to my parents.  My parents are great, maybe a little emotional neglect on my part but when they knew of my brother condition, they tried their best to be better. My mother tries to be more understanding even if sometimes, she nags at my brother and that is why he doesn't go to her. My father is a little emotionally stunned, I think, because he grew up in a traditional family where men couldn't show their emotions but he has tried to be more available emotionally. He changed job so that he would be less stress and he even offered to go see a therapist to speak about his own issues.Now onto my main consern. With the stuff that has been happening with the Spanish teacher and all the stress the school and my parents have put on my brother, have put him somewhat a little down lately because he didn't do so well in some weekly evaluation and so my parents started comparing him to me since I did well (not without my own mental issues happening because of that even if they don't know the whole extend). They started to stress him because of an oral that he has in Spanish that he didn't really prepare and it caused my brother several breakdowns in tears. He came to me today when we spoke about it and he admitted to feeling really down, that he didn't found joy in much things beside his videogames and that sometimes he thought that death would be better than all those feeling he has. I didn't really know what to do at the time. I reassured him that I loved him should anything happened and that it was unconditional. I made sure he didn't think of doing anything soon and I suggested that he speaks about it to his psychologist. He told me that he would think about it. I'm really worried about him since he has more of a mindset to give up than fight against what bothered him. Since I'm also his emotional support system (he doesn't really go to my parents) and that I'm going away after the end of highschool to continue my studies, I fear he will not go to anyone and might act on those thoughts. I don't want to break his trust by going to my parents, don't want to go to his therapist if it's only because of what has been happening with the teacher and will cause more troubles for him if he doesn't feel that way completely and only said so because he was breakingdown, I don't really want to talk to any of my friends because I don't want to bother them and I don't want them to know something so private about my brother without his consent. I don't know if I should wait and see because I don't want to miss something and be to late should something happen.I really don't know what to do or what to say and to who. I could really use some advice please.;Hello, I'm not English so sorry about any mistakes.

In a last ditch effort I tried to see if I could get admitted to hospital so i do not have the chance, but they spent the entire phone call just trying to convince me not to come to hospital and just be more positive. My current plan is to kill myself on wednesday and i have booked a train ticket to the beach and bought more pills than last time so i can take them and either OD on the beach or OD/drown. This was kinda my last ditch effort and essentially just got told to be a man. I have a Gp appointment on tuesday to discuss my depression medication so I might tell them and see what they can do but if not I will go ahead with what I have planned.I have been told by my Gp and psychiatrists that if I feel at immediate risk then i can commit myself but I guess i can’t?NHS is a shambles sometimes;I have made an attempt before, and i have been preparing and making plans for a second attempt.

1c8xr7q;Please send kind words 🤍, need to vent;Purple-Yesterday-452;I have been having severe cognitive weakness and dissosiation due to fight or flight from anxiety for years to the point that it has become unbearable. Just being so confused, forgetful and disorientated, making too many mistakes and being unable to concentrate properly, feeling disconnected from everything.It is so traumatizing as if being already being so from a history of abuse, bullying, ocd, psychosis and existential and religious trauma isn't enough. I have no friends and even if I did, it's hard to find ones that  the same interest as me. I find my life very depressing and meaningless and I don't know how I am going on. TBH, I feel like all existence is futile as I never connect with anything and don't think highly of life from past experiences. I also worry about my capabilities to feed myself in the future. Oh what could I do, if only I didn't have this.If things don't change I don't know that I will be able to continue. But the again, a person that has such intrusive thoughts about violence and is in such a bad fear response will never be able to do something as gut wrenching as suicide.I am already going to a psychiatrist and have been on medication for 2 years but things haven't been improving much these days.Sorry, needed to vent in all detail so at least someone would take my problems seriously.

Maybe I should apply again, and this time, attach a detailed suicide plan, defining the methods, schedule and budget.How stupid can someone having a stable post be.  If I die, do I need that pensions, for satan's sake? The human crap making those decisions is a highly educated moron, a medical doctor.

Both men and women see my body as disgusting shit and get turned on by talking shit about it. Every single fucking day its a new post showing some lady with giant tits and a flat woman and the comments are filled with fan fiction of how ashamed the smaller woman must feel, how there's only one ""real"" woman in the photo. The biggest punch in the face was seeing some women with big breasts say it turned them on to make flatter women jealous, what the fuck, even other women look down on me.Men with small dicks get this kind of treatment all the time and it baffles me how so many of them haven't blown their brains out yet because when I'm old enough to buy a gun I'm killing myself, I can't handle this shit.

My heart started racing as I panic called 150+ people in an hour... I was initially happy about getting back into this career, but now.....I've made mistakes I'm not perfect, but I just want life to slow down and instead it just seems to get faster and faster and the demands harder and harder...A woman I worked with almost made me cry just because she said she was proud of me... I realized it was the first time someone said that to me. She took my position at the restaurant I resigned from. I too was happy for her and we keep in touch regularly.

Right now, I couldn't bring myself to smile in front of my parents. I always felt angry every time they are around even when they did something good for me I can't bring myself to smile I just can't. right now I felt like it would be easier for me and for them if I am dead right now. every time my father went out and left a gun for me to take care I always pick it up, aim at my head, and thinking what if I pull the trigger.

1c8tg9h;I feel lost.;ProfessionalRush6761;I’m a 21 year old dude and growing up I didn’t have friends till about 12 or 13 and they were a bad crowd you know like smoking weed vandalism and all that and about 14 that’s when I got with my middle school sweetheart, We dated for about 3 years and we did have a kid in that time. Now I don’t really remember anything with her except the core memories but after we broke up my “friend” group chose her and kinda left me in the ditch alone with no friends, no one to hang out with anymore just cut out entirely . So I ended up in a foster home at about 17 cause my dad decided to move to Oregon but Oregon didn’t work out for me I was bullied at the highschool I went to, I couldn’t make a single friend. I was the weirdo when back at home I’d normally be the cool kid who smokes and doesn’t listen to teachers so it was hard. I come back to cali and end up in that foster home. And I was there for two months and the foster mom did not want me there anymore and in her words she said “we don’t want you here. We can’t help you.” And that’s when it started happening again and again the suicidal thoughts. And when I was about 13 I tried to overdose myself with about 150 pills it wasn’t super powerful pills so I was lucky when I got to the hospital they were able to get them all out before they could all dissolve into my stomach.so now I’m 21 years of age I have no social life I want to end my life so bad and only reason I think I haven’t is cause I don’t want to die but I’m so lonely, none of my family talks to me not my aunts no uncle no cousins nobody. I’m nothing to everyone around me and that’s what makes me want to end it.so it’s conflicting sorry for all this I just have no one to  tell my story to.If I ever take my own life I just want that to be the one thing I can control in my life.

1c8tbi8;Scared I won’t make it to my 25th birthday ;Pretty_Mistake_9584;I’m 24 in a couple months and within the next year I don’t think I’ll cope to make it to my 25th. I prefer to stay as anonymous as possible due to my background. Around the time I was 17, my parents broke the news to me that we have grown up in the country we’ve been living in since I was around 3 as illegal immigrants. Basically where we live wouldn’t approve our visas ( it’s a long story) but it was very difficult for me. This time of my life I wanted to start driving, travel, apply for uni at some point maybe. But that dream disappeared so quickly. Ever since, I continue to study, work here and there where I can. For the past couple of years, I have been suspecting that I may have autism. From how I behaved as a kid and even now, I’ve always been made to feel that I wasn’t normal and the way I react to things are not right or ‘different’. It has ruined so many of my friendships. They couldn’t understand me so I’ve had a lot of people cut me off. People I’ve been friends with since a little girl. As a teen I just assumed it was everyone and not me (as most teens do lol) my parents have had suspicions about me being autistic since I was a kid but I’ve just never been diagnosed I guess. This has made me feel a lot more isolated and unimportant, of course. For years now my mental health has just been deteriorating more and more and It’s just shit upon shit. I come back from work, run myself a bath and just cry so hard I want to be sick or I get the most excruciating migraine because my life feels worthless. I can’t get the career I want. I can’t travel. I’m stuck at home and will be for the rest of my life. I am so alone in my thoughts all the time. Things are kind of touchy when talking to my parents about it, but most of the time my mom will just tell me that she doesn’t know what to do or how to help. Idk I just wanted to rant about my extremely fucking sad and embarrassing life story. The past year I’d say (more the past few months) the one thought keeps popping into my head: if my status is still the same within the next year, I will be dead at 25. I will be dead at 25. That is what will show on my gravestone. Everyone will remember me as the sad girl that stays inside, eats her weight and won’t amount to anything. I just can’t carry on like this. Nobody in my life will never understand or relate to my situation. So, I don’t do anything really. Just, sit alone with my thoughts. I’m not actually too sure why I am sharing this, on Reddit of most places… but I just can’t bottle anymore up than I already have. I’m done. I have no outlet and I’m scared of my own thoughts. Idk, I’m sure someone on here can somewhat relate even though I strongly feel my story is rare and unique but I pray that it isn’t. I cannot be the only one out there. Anyways, it’s a long shot ig.;I’m 24 in a couple months and within the next year I don’t think I’ll cope to make it to my 25th.

I have a wife and a 5 month old son ehich I love, like I can't even describe the feeling I have for him. So those thoughts were lurking in back of my mind for quite a while, I usually supressed them.I don't think it's depression cause I think I had it during the most severe lockdowns back in 2020, when I was all alone. But the thoughts kept lurking closer and closer. Especially for past month when my wife and I were having marital problems, but for the past week everything was OK.Last night I was reading an article about how most men who commit s do not have any mental problems. I wanted to share this info to my wife but she said ""there is so much stuff to do around the child and you're worried about some bullshit!""Which made me sad. Not angry not anything just pure sad. She noticed my mood change and asked me if i'm mad and I said ""a little but i'm more sad than mad"" and then she snapped at me. I wanted to make amends but to no avail. When we woke up I tried to talk with her but what I got is ""I don't love you anymore"", ""I'm with you because of the child"", ""I despise you"",""You're nothing to me and I don't care about you"", and some other stuff I would rather not utter about my worth.And for the first time I broke. I was playing with my child and when she was bashing me I excused myself and went to the bathroom to weep for the first time since I remember.  I went on the balcony (I live on a 16th floor, or 17th for Americans) and leaned forward and those thoughts started screaming to me. I decided not to because of how weak pussy of a man I am.I don't know what to do.Please";Hey everyone.

Anyways the next day I go home and find out he had still been seeing his ex but she rejected him so he ran to me I told a few adults around me and some friends all who told me that I had been lied to and manipulated this whole experience fundamentally changed me as a person and to this day he still sees ex I feel so disgusted that he put his hands on me I feel my girlhood has been stolen.

I just have been since I was around 10. I've attempted twice in the past two years and I usually make jokes about how 'third times the charm' and just dumb shit like that ig.It did start off as a joke, I thought I had been doing better but I fully want to do It again. I'm hypocritical, I preach to my friends about how they shouldn’t hurt themselves the way I did because its painful as hell but I for some reason don't hold myself to those standards.I don't know why I'm the way I am, I don't want to be me. I have reasons to live, friends, family, hobbies, pets, films I wanna watch, but at moments like these I just don't care all that much. One of the time's I tried to kill myself it was out of spite? I'm unhealthy I know that I have been unhealthy for a long time but everyone seems to think i'm already better a year later. I've gone through a lot of things that left me crazy traumatised so maybe thats attributing to my urge to harm myself but idk because it didn’t affect me at the time, why would it affect me now?My dad's dying to cancer, its unlikely he's part of the 15% of people that live past five years with the type he has. It sucks? Would it be selfish to make him bury me when he's got not much time left. probably. I'm a healthy teen, psychically speaking, I won't die out of the blue or disappear like I wish for every other night lmaoI get crazy thoughts about cutting myself often, it's a bad coping mechanism but its something i've been resorting to lately. I guess maybe I want people to care about me the way I care about them? All my friends have copious inside jokes and like cool but they never include me.I recently left a huge friend group of people, online friends that i've known for two years. They weren’t the best people and made me feel like shit, they'd treat others like shit too. They'd fuck around with kids significantly younger than them and their excuse would be stuff like ""How else are we supposed to have fun"", I thought leaving that group would make me feel better but honestly i've been having degrading thoughts more often.Just a bunch of petty teenage drama, it all wears me down. If you told 11 year old me that i'd be 15 in September I would throw a fit, I probably still would. I always told myself I wouldn’t let myself get to 15 and it just seems so surreal that i'll be that age soon.

1c8mnml;A 13 year old love story closing its book makes me wanna close my own.;OkArt3883;Thought I found my soulmate 13 years ago we talked about kids, futures and our lives together. 8 years ago I got diagnosed with CRPS (affectionately nicknamed the “suicide disease” for its tendency towards how sufferers prefer other options to living with it). At that time I told her I no longer wanted kids, at the time I was living essentially in bed and had almost ended it with a bottle of pain killers, ended up switching to medical marijuana for pain management constantly. 6 years ago we move close enough to my nephews on the other side of the country, their dad had just left them. So I set it as a goal to get more mobile, not necessarily keeping up, but at least present. 5 years ago, progress had been made with mobility, function and other things. So much so that I could now do chores around the house in smaller increments. At this time I talk to my wife about kids again, she now seeing my improvement agrees to think about it more and encourages my continued improvement. 3 years ago, we move 1/2 way across the country to be closer to her parents and her neph and niece who had their own shitty dad. We bought our own house, and for the first 2 years had one of our nieces living with us. She didn’t want to pressure her family out of the house by getting pregnant during that time. 6 months ago her niece left our place. The convo about children came up again, she said she needed some time to think. So I waited till about a month ago to bring it up again. She responded by wanting some time alone, so I gave that too her. Sitting lonely at home with our dogs for about 3 weeks straight. She says she doesn’t want kids. I tell her that I’m ok with it, that I had married her and not some future children. She says her reason is that she’s not happy, and that would like to continue time apart. Yesterday she told me she wants me to leave town so she can figure out if it’s the house that makes her unhappy or me. This morning she said she wanted a separation. My heart is shattered, I’m tired of hurting emotionally, but also physically after 8 years of feeling like my leg has been on fire. So now I want it all too stop. My biggest holdback is my 4 year old dog. But I feel like she can take care of him just fine. I want to go buy a shotgun drive out to the desert, setup a warning sign so I don’t fuck up someone not ready to see it.;Thought I found my soulmate 13 years ago we talked about kids, futures and our lives together. 8 yea;;1;1;2024-04-20 10:22:20;2024-04-20;Saturday;10:22:20;2358;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:48.391340

1c8jj81;Fuck;dyingsquid101299;"I never get much opportunity to talk but when jt comes to posting on here, there are so many topics that I don't know where to begin. I'm so tired of other people my age or younger living happy, worthy lives. They get to go on adventures. They get to do meaningful work. They are admired. They have lives that are actually worth living. They contribute to the world.My life moves at a snail's pace. There is so much I constantly have to do and there is just no fucking payoff at all to any of it. I used to not mind other people being successful but now I just put in so fucking much and nothing happens. Well, I feel both like I put in so much and like I don't contribute anything. The world constantly reinforces the idea that I do nothing so I guess I must not be doing enough.I am so hopelessly tired of having no way whatsoever to deal with anything other than writing something anonymously on here (I've done it a dozen or so times before) and painfully suffering fucking constantly and just enduring and enduring.For anyone else, it's fine. Their hard work pays off innumerably more. But for me, you can't do one fucking thing wrong or else you will unacceptably fail. I give time to my part time job. I give time to school. I give time to trying to get a career. I give time to trying to generate supplemental income. It is never enough. Nothing is ever enough; you take one fucking little bit of time out of any of these and you fail it. Besides, nothing good actually comes out of any of this. There are no rewards for fucking ANY OF THIS AT ALLLLLLLLL. But of course, you can't stop at any of it, lest things immediately get noticeably and markedly worse. My entire life I've felt in my bones through lived experience that upward positive change moves at a fucking glacial God damn pace, but I do one tiny bit of anything wrong and there are IMMEDIATE MAJOR negative changes.Suicide entered as a concept in my mind around 10. In 24 now and over the years it has only grown as a possibility. Like a financial plan for a company, as time progresses, the idea that this is the only practical solution has become more and more apparent. People tell me that life is worth living but I don't feel that way at all. My life has been upheld by the absolutely beautiful moments, but they have always been so few. As time progresses, the percentage those moments make up becomes smaller and smaller.I'm going to say something that sounds hyperbolic; I'm even contributing to that by giving it an introduction, but I really mean it when I say it. Every single moment of my entire life, the world is telling me in some way, shape or form that I am a completely worthless mediocre piece of shit.I don't want a message to make me feel better; I actually want my life to get better, but it really really really feels like nothing I do changes anything positively. Even if a little kid learns to not let the school bullies get to them, that didn't change the fact that every day they were still mocked and beaten while the adults around them allowed it.I can't take it.

1c8i4i3;17M White;Scared-Ad5455;I'm 17. 06 kid. I grew up in a real Catholic German family, then we stopped being religious, but I still had the same sense of morality and masculinity and so on, and still do. This world started to feel hostile towards me when I started paying attention at the personal and societal level so I started closing up. i was abused in childhood and got into all sorts of fights and trouble throughout my childhood. I even got expelled from in-person high school.Anyways, during high school I've gotten a tight knit group of nutcases that are great and all, and are cool with me being quieter and a bit of a distant oddball. I'm a fighter and have always had a talent for it. It's the only thing that really brought me joy over the past handful of years, and it's been a necessary life skill to have. I lived with discipline and stoicism, and the adrenaline highs from fighting were all I needed. Relationships were and still are a no go after I started off strong with my mandatory Bipolar Girl With Daddy Issues™. My discipline is breaking, my drive is fading, my anger is colling into a droning red hot state rather than a white hot driving force. Fighting doesn't feel nearly as good anymore. I've been masturbating profusely, going from once every few days to a couple times a day. I was always a shield for my two younger brothers, and they're on their ways to being better than me. I broke so they could stay mostly intact. I've been banking on suicide as a comfort for years, to the point of nonchalance about it. I think I'm going to do it for my 18th birthday, this May. We've become a gun family over time so I'll have access to a way to take myself out without any backfires. I want to take the burden off of all of them. I'm a quiet, distant, loveless bastard with no real purpose anymore. I just pursue my own bloodlust and that doesn't even feel good hardly if at all anymore. I'll be a stone in the road that everyone will get over quickly before they realize how little anything changes. I just wanted to put it somewhere. Nothing feels real, none of it needs to be.;I'm 17. 06 kid.

1c8hrb7;I'm too old to go through it again. ;Eldie1;This is a long story – and I apologize for that. I figured I should tell the whole story, for both you – and for my adult children. I’m not comfortable with leaving a note behind. Also, everything in this is true and can be PROVEN. I’m willing to entertain this while I’m still here. If you want proof of anything written below, just ask and I’ll provide the proof you request. I probably have maybe 3 weeks left – to make it, or to give up AGAIN. Thanks!My father severely abused me from the time I was in diapers until I was big enough and man enough to stand up to him. He would leave bleeding welts on top of older bruised welts. I once showed my 6th grade teacher thinking I would be kept safe, and the only thing that happened was she talked to him and more abuse. He hit me in my head often, knocked me unconscious, and called me stupid. He is responsible for the low self-esteem and low self-image I carried with me throughout my life. I never felt worthy of anything or anyone. I did meet a beautiful girl 21 when I was 23. She was in an abusive marriage and wanted out. I don’t know if she really fell in love with me, or used me to save her from her current situation. I did fall in love with her though. We got married (a year and a half after her divorce) and had 2 kids. I was in a bad car accident and became addicted to the pain pills. Instead of supporting treatment or rehab, she packed up herself and the kids, and left me. She moved in with her dad. I sank into a depression and my addiction progressed. It evolved to heroin. I got caught and was sentenced to 5 years in prison. She moved back into the house. I did overcome my addiction and quit in 2008 while in prison.She started writing to me when I had one year left to serve before my release from prison. She never did tell me she loved me, but told me that she missed me, felt safe and secure with me, and blah, blah, blah… She was in another abusive relationship again though, and I guess she needed to be rescued again. I still don’t know if she ever loved me, but I was in love with her, and planned to move back home and reclaim my family – my wife, my kids, my home.6 months before my release, the truth came out. She was away from the abusive guy, and  needed support. She needed food stamps, Medicaid, and WIC and had to file for divorce in order to qualify for the benefits. WIC? Yeah, more of the truth – she had 2 more kids with the abusive crackhead (literally). 1 month before my release, she notified me that she had let him come back a few months ago,  because she needed his financial support. I also found out that this dude had my wife, and my 2 sons (then 15 and 17) smoking weed and that Mojo Spice synthetic crap. My kids actually quit school!!! I had to get home and clean up my house and get my family back the way it’s supposed to be.I got back home after 5 yrs.in prison (03/2013), got rid of him, and fixed my family. It didn’t happen overnight,  but we slowly got back to normal. It took about a year. She actually ‘showed’ her love for me. Maybe she had a hard time saying it because of her traumatic experiences with domestic abuse. IDK. We planned on getting remarried in a year or so. My wife developed a bad cough, and by Christmas 2014, she kept dropping things – phone, drinks, silverware, whatever. I took her to the hospital. The MRI showed 7 lesions in her brain. They believed the Spice/Mojo caused a lung cancer that rapidly spread to her lymph nodes and then to her brain. Prognosis – 4 to 6 months. The radiation made her very sick. She rather spend her last few months with as little sickness as possible and refused all future treatments.I never stopped loving her and I feel like I was about to be cheated out of something I never did get to get to fully enjoy. I needed to make every moment count and I stayed by her bedside. She passed after 5 months (05/2015). I didn’t work those 5 months, fell into deep depression 5 to 6 months because part of me died too, and we didn’t have life insurance. After trying to pay everything, I ran out of money and lost everything. I became homeless. My wife said the Bible says, “Ashes to ashes.. “ and she wanted to be ashes. She didn’t want to be put on display and remembered in the condition the cancer left her in – skin on bones and bald. She picked the picture she wanted used at her memorial service, and wanted to be cremated. I did exactly as she wished. Her catholic family didn’t believe she wanted to be cremated, and accused me of taking the cheap way out. I could get no financial assistance from my in-laws (ex in-laws). My parents were dead, and my kids were now 17 and 19. My wife’s family helped my kids, but I had no one to help me. Homelessness was inevitable. My ex-in-laws bailed me out of the foreclosure on the house, but I could no longer live there. They only did it for my kids. I couldn’t pay for the utilities or food, so my kids stayed in our house and I had to leave, so my in-laws (ex) would help support my kids until they could become financially independent, or until I could get my life together and buy back my house (or another one).I had a couple cousins and friends open their homes to me, but I could obviously see my presence causing a strain on their relationships. I left for the homeless shelter. My first night there, someone stole my bag while I was sleeping, and I had nothing but the clothes on my back. I no longer had an ID and couldn’t stay at the homeless shelter again without one. I was really on the streets the end of 2015. I never wanted to be a panhandler and hold up a cardboard sign at a traffic intersection, but I had to become that person. It was so degrading – especially with everyone yelling, “Go get a job loser!” Who would hire someone with no identification card, no address, no transportation, no bank account for direct deposit, someone who hasn’t showered, had a haircut, or a change of clothes in over 6 months???Near the end of 2016, the cops saw me panhandling and recognized me from a missing persons flyer. He told me to call the people who reported me missing – the nursing home. The nurse stated that my mother was dying and really wanted to see me before she died. I told her that I’ll come as soon as possible. She said,  “That was 5 months ago. Your mom passed away almost 4 months ago, in mid 2016.”I was determined to beat homelessness by panhandling. I would panhandle 12 hours a day, and save as much as I could. I could survive on $10 for food, and would save everything else I’d collect. I averaged between $25 and $40 a day. I became homeless when people were already tired of panhandlers at every traffic light. It was hard to make any money panhandling. Most homeless people were alcoholics and drug addicts, and it seemed everyone knew it – and I blended in with them, I guess. I actually had homeless drug addicts asking to borrow money from me. Dude, I’m homeless just like you… I guess nothing can be hidden in plain sight. I guess they watched how many times I collected a dollar or two, and realized I hardly spent any. I don’t know, but they knew I had some money. I had almost $1500 in cash, and I was so close to beating homelessness. In March 2017 while I was looking for odd jobs, a guy rode up to me on a bicycle, pulled out a gun, put it to my head and said, “Give it all to me.” I’m not going to let someone just shoot me in the head. I put up a fight, and in the struggle for the gun, he twisted it into my chest and pulled the trigger. He shot me in the chest and the bullet barely missed my heart. Because of the positioning, the bullet traveled through my intestines, hit and fractured my pelvic bone and lodged in my left-back waistline. I woke up in the ICU with an incision from the top of my chest down to below my abdomen – and I had a colostomy bag.I lost my wife, lost everything else, became homeless, lost my mom and missed telling her goodbye, got robbed and shot, and now had a colostomy bag. I was discharged from the hospital to bedrest, to keep my wound clean, and was supposed to change the colostomy bag daily. I couldn’t get medical supplies or colostomy bags. They are mailed by McKesson, and I didn’t have an address. I used 1 colostomy bag for several weeks and had it duct taped to my stomach. It kept leaking. I couldn’t take anymore. I reached my breaking point and wanted to die – immediately!!!A few homeless people overdosed on fentanyl and some died on $10 and $20 bags. I decided that’s how I would go. I panhandled and saved $68. I got with a homeless drug addict and bought him a $20 bag for hooking me up, and bought a ½ gram and a syringe for $50 ($48). I went to the middle of the park and did almost all of it in one shot. The $20 bag overdosed Brian, but the $50 didn’t overdose me. I don’t understand, because I haven’t even drank since 2008. It was over 9 years since I did anything. I don’t know. It did make me seriously loaded/high though. It didn’t kill me, but it made me feel good and it poisoned my thinking - I didn’t have to think or care. I still wanted to die though…As long as I used the fentanyl, suicide wasn’t so urgent. I was able to live. I wasn’t able to cope. I was only able to live a while longer by suppressing the suicidal thoughts. Without it,  I probably would have run out in front of a speeding truck or something. I was able to panhandle without caring, and I was able to take a little better care of myself. I was able to convince my surgeon that I was no longer homeless, and I got him to reverse the ostomy.  My life was getting better. In 2018, my intestines pushed through the incision giving me a 12cm stage 2 incisional hernia. In 2019 I had my 3rd major surgery to repair the hernia. My life was surely improving, but still sucked. The only thing that could possibly prevent suicide and stop the drugs would be beating homelessness. In March 2020 the world pandemic came. The local government put all of the homeless in hotels and motels. I now had a temporary address and filed for food stamps, the 2 stimulus checks, and pandemic unemployment. I made a plan to use the pandemic money ONLY to get off the streets.  I became chemically dependent on the fentanyl, but became a handyman for the motel and used that income to support my dependency. I used my pandemic money only to buy a 2018 Nissan in 2020 with only 23k miles on it, rented a house with a big yard, and bought enough tools to start my own handyman business. The only thing left to do was kick the dependency. I say ‘chemically dependent’ and not ‘addicted’, because I had no psychological obsession and compulsion for the stuff. I didn’t like the way it made me feel anymore. I didn’t like it poisoning my thoughts anymore. I only had a physical need for it to be able to function. Otherwise I went through withdrawal sickness. I was able to go to a detox hospital, and they only let me stay 7 days (Medicaid won’t cover any longer than that). I didn’t experience any withdrawals until day 6. I was being discharged the next day. I had to get on MATs (Suboxone). I didn’t like it, and went with the Sublocade injection. I weaned myself off of that and I’m completely drug-free now.Unfortunately, my business suffered when I went to the detox hospital. I planned on staying in contact with my contract customers, but the detox hospital lost my wallet with my list of phone numbers during intake. Cell phones are not allowed, so I brought my number list with me. I lost my 2 biggest contracts. I planned on stringing them along for the week, but no contact for an entire week violated our contract. I went from making $2000 to $3000 a week to $2000 a month. I recently had my endocrine system crash and I became very sick. My body stopped producing hormones and other things. I had no energy,  I was tired all the time, and I gained 80 lbs in less than 6 months. I went from 185 to almost 270 lbs. I got so big, I couldn’t breathe when trying to tie my shoes.I’m on testosterone injections and other meds now. My health is getting a little better, but my business is gone. I have no customers left. I haven’t had much income in months. I’ve been living off of my savings. My savings is gone. I’ve tried to find a job, but I’m 56 yrs old, out of shape and not in the best health, and other than my own small business, I have no verifiable employment history in the past 10 years. Either I’m overqualified, underqualified, too old, no employment history, a convicted felon, etc. I’m about to lose everything again. I refuse to become homeless again. I’d rather be dead. I could sell my tools, but then I might as well plan on never working again. The last time I reached my breaking point, I really tried to kill myself on an overdose of fentanyl. I’m not scared to do it again. This time, the syringe I have (for the testosterone injections) is a LOT bigger. I could probably fit 10x as much. I’m not scared to fall asleep and never wake up again.  I’ve been super lonely since Lisa died. I feel I have nothing more to live for anymore anyway. Being 56 now, my life is basically over anyway. I’ve come a long way. I’ve come too far to lose it all and become homeless again. This isn’t a cry for help and I’m not attention-seeking. This post is more for my kids to understand why I chose this way. They have their own lives now, and there’s nothing they can do to make my life better anyway. I’ve been lonely too long, and now I can’t afford to pay my bills anymore. I refuse to be homeless again. If I can find a way to cover my bills, it would definitely buy me some more time. I just don’t want to be lonely much longer either. If something great happens, great! If not, I’ll be gone in about 3 weeks. I’ll probably be evicted right after the first week of May. If so, bye cruel world! Come to think about it… Lisa passed away on May 9, 2015. I could go May 9, 2024. I’m not religious anymore either. I lost all of that over the years… Please don’t tell me that I’m still here because God has a plan for me, or anything like that. If this is his plan, his plan (my whole life basically) sucks, and I don’t want any part of it anymore!!! My life has gotten so much better since losing my religion. It feels better to not think a loving God gave me this life. And please don’t preach. I’m a atheist now, and only God himself could prove his existence and convert me back to a theist.

1c8hd1a;I don’t feel like my life is mine, or that it gets better from here;Cheddar_Soupx;I (18m) graduate this year and my senior year hasn’t been great. I’m dreading graduating simply because my mother has been making it about her.I’m supposed to have senior photos taken tomorrow, and I can’t even wear what I want. She didn’t like pretty much anything I brought out. I asked if I could bring a change of clothes so I could have some photos I like, but she was pretty much just like “well he’s probably going to charge me more for the extra time.” I don’t have the motivation for college. ADHD has made school so impossible without me even taking college level courses. Career options feel impossible but I do have a deadline. Another thing bothering me about graduating is how much harder it’ll be to make friends with people my age. And how little time I’d have to hang out with them in person regardless. I love my online friends but I wish I had just one person who would consistently invite me to things, or at least show interest in seeing me. I’m lonely and no matter how many people I talk to online, it doesn’t help. I want to be invited places. I want to have sleepovers, idgaf how old I am. I spent a lot of highschool grounded, and the rest of the time my going out was extremely limited or just not worth it. My mother never really wanted to say yes to anything. I still have to tell her I’m not dating someone if I go somewhere with them, just us 2. I’m going to miss the idea of highschool, the one u see in movies, but fuck I’ll never miss my personal highschool experience. Meds have helped but only so much. I feel like therapy isn’t worth the money I spend so much time working my ass off to make. I hate living where I am and feeling constantly unsafe because of my father attacking me last September. Because of that shit I’m triggered so much easier. Tiny things that aren’t even related will be mentioned and I’m on the verge of a panic attack. I hate the constant flashbacks. On bad days it’s absolutely debilitating.I can’t leave. I can’t enjoy a lot of my life even when I try- my parents make it really difficult. I hate the loneliness.

I feel alone but I still just have no plans of reaching out to anyone close or really anyone  else . I put up a face when with people and I really do feel happy yet every single time I’m alone I feel painfully numb , it’s just a feeling of everything feels fake I can tell people talk behind my back in the moment it don’t bother me after though it hurts .Everyday I recall days and regrets but one thing that’s always constant is the fact that I have no will to change my anything .I hate the way I feel and if I do act upon it it’s like it’s embarrassing and “unmanly” I’m young but not to far from adulthood .

1c8h5f5;Suicide but when?;SlycheeFluff;My life has gone off the rails long before I had any control over it.I lived on to spite others. I wanted to push past only so I could stomp on them for a change before I offed myself.Now I'm here. I've pushed past everything. I survived every last hurdle and I just can't do it. I sit here scrolling these posts trying to find some common ground. As if someone else's reason for suicide can magically convince me. It never happens.Things were never worth fighting for. Life was horrible then and it's worse now. When I think of the future I can only envision disappointment and when I lay down to sleep my past haunts my dreams.I guess I'm confused. How much more do I have to do before I can finally die? What's this thing in my head that always stops me? Maybe I'm just destined to go as some Martyr. For what cause I don't want to know, but recently I've been thinking maybe my mind is holding back because I wanna die for some cause. Maybe if I go all out one final time and get more reckless with myself I'll be able to let go of this piece of shit life. Sucks I don't live in a world where giving your life for a good cause comes by easy. I just know when I see it I'll jump at it. Maybe save some people with a real future doing it.;My life has gone off the rails long before I had any control over it.I lived on to spite others.

Don’t work out. Don’t own cars. Don’t do anything fun in real life, maybe the occasional meet up once every two months for someone’s birthday. they fucking rage at video games and suck at them anyway. The only upside is that they’re such losers they’ll never be really mean they’re usually chill or just kind of mean.

I wish sometimes I had never associated with them but I’ve been beat down and dragged through the dirt by toxic friends that betrayed me and sold me out. And honestly, it’s partly my fault. For being born in a traumatizing shitty family and having a personality disorder. I never react correctly. I never understand people’s thoughts correctly. Once I got diagnosed my whole life made sense. No wonder people treat me like shit. And I treat them like shit. And that shit will never heal from me. I want to kill myself.

Whats more is that I live in Indonesia, which means I have to deal with job hunting even for the low paying jobs. My family and my mom view me as living trash inside the house, not even an attention and wants me to take Magister degree (or S2), in which well, lets just say im smart but mental wise im not up there for the task (dont ask, its a mental pain built up for years and another story overall). So, yeah, im really stressed up with less to no money right now.

1c8g6gs;Idk a post I guess ;IceAlarmed5467;I’ve been thinking of suicide since I was 13. I set a new deadline for my suicide last year and i’m approaching it but I’m having difficulty deciding wether or not I want to live. Part of why I go on living is because I know my death will cause more harm to the people who idiotically care about me. I also believe I deserve to live because that means I’ll guarantee I will continue suffering in life. Yet at the same time death seems like a relief to me and while I deserve the bad things in life I don’t deserve the chance I have to live because whatever I try to do I will fail because I’m worthless. I’m so tired now and I want it to be over. I think perhaps there is some innate level self preservation going on. I wish I could be rid of it. I know none of this makes any kind of logical sense it’s just what I’m feeling right now.

1c8g2wo;My deadline to kill myself was June 2024...but things turned around;gibocracy;"I've been posting here, mainly to the void, but I use this like an anonymous blog. About twice a year, I do this. I often read my past posts to see where I am at mentally. In 2020, after separating from the military, I made plans to kill myself in 2024.  The goal was to live my life to the fullest as best i can and see where i end up mentally. If I still felt like shit, then I was going to end my life after graduating. Things have turned around. I set out to do all the goals i set out for myself and some how achieved them all. I even got enough courage to ask a girl out yesterday, and she said yes. I've been a loner and loser my whole life, and I am at the end of this journey with a new perspective. Things aren't always so great. I do find myself wanting to end my life every once in a while, but it's not as severe as it was in 2020. Despite my new view in life, I still have one suicidal belief that I don't think I will ever grow out of. I don't truly value my life; my new plan is to end it when I can no longer work.  When I was in the military, I had savings that accumulated similar to an IRA; it was called TSP (Thrift Savings Plan). I suspect i wont live past the time when I can use that money, which is 59 1/2. Even if i did live long enough, i probably will have five years tops. So, my new plan is basically to pull the money out early (which isn't much) and to kill myself as my retirement. It's pretty silly, but that's what I've decided. Not because I'm super depressed but simply because I don't want to suffer after I retire.I know no one will read this; this is mainly for future me and possibly a loved one who happens to find these posts after my death.";I've been posting here, mainly to the void, but I use this like an anonymous blog.

1c8g1ls;Hello! Please help, its about my little sister;hopeestheim13;Hello! It's wild I made an account just for this but I really don't know who to turn to. My little sister (15) a month ago got put into into a mental hospital because she was harming herself. I knew she had done it once previously but we're close and she promised she'd never do it again, I checked on her often but I feel like I didnt do enough and I didn't know how to handle the situation properly. The day it happened again, I quickly realized something was wrong because she was covering her wrists with a hoodie and would not move. I told this to my mom and she said we'd have to keep a close eye on her. Unfortunately (Or fortunately?), she was sick the next day and my dad took her to the doctor, he quickly catched on to what she did and admitted her there (she agreed to it because she found that she was not doing well at all and it might do her good). She was there for a week, and once she was out she seemed a lot happier (However, she felt like a completely different version of herself.). When she came out, all she could talk about was her experiences there and all the friends she made. It seemed like a horrible place to be at (but once again, I'm not the right person to say this as I think I'm more mentally stable). She mentioned stuff the girls there would do, they attempted to eat soap to kill themselves, they would fight a lot, they would make inappropriate jokes. She said it as if it was nothing, she told us she felt like she could finally be understood by others. As long as she was better, I was better (well, it still is a little bit tough because it's hard to deal with the fact that the person you love most in the world could ever think about doing that, and it makes me very sad). Right now, I'm just very concerned about the friends she has. They werent allowed to share their phone numbers over there, but they still did and are keeping in contact. I feel like she's gotten way too close with these girls way too fast. They all don't seem okay, and I know they have their issues. I'm just very concerned that my sister would want to take care of their issues and help them whilst not finding help for herself, because she is like that. She spends a lot of time in the day texting these girls. I'm very afraid of them passing onto my sister weird ideologies about self-harm and getting her into bad things like drugs and such.It worries me even more that theyre the only friends she has. I just wouldn't want her to be ONLY around with people that self-harm and have a lot of issues. Recently, she's been getting along with a friend of mine that has a lot of issues, she's almost always high and is bipolar. She is great and all, however, I don't think my sister is in the right mind right now to get along with her. I want her to have different friends but it's very hard for her to socialize. I'm so confused, I don't know what to do. I don't want to bother my parents with this because I'm sure they have it a lot harder than I do. I just want to know how I can handle this situation. I'm usually very calm for these things, but  when it's my little sister it just worries me to death. Please, please! I really need advice. I feel like my life has been a nightmare during these times. If you want to know other details, do ask. I really need help and I can't turn towards other friends for this because it's a really private thing in her life and I don't know if she'd allow me to talk about this to a close friend. I really don't think they'll know how to help me anyway. Please tell me what I can do.1. I wrote this like a month ago and a small update, she kept in contact with her friends and they put an idea into her head that she should try drugs and so she bought a vape that caused her really bad side effects because she was also on anti-anxiety/depression meds and we had to take her to emergengy. She fainted in school and had really bad heart problems. This got her sent back to the psych ward and she's back and she doesn't seem good at all, she says she's fine but shes always sulking and is angry. My dad took her phone and ipad from her because of said friends and she got psychosis pills from the psych ward this time (which I believe are not necessary since I think the psychosis is a side effect of the vape?). Maybe this has something to do? What can I do? Help me please, I'm so desperate. I just want to see her happy again. I'm afraid she might attempt to end her life at any moment. She was incredibly full of regret and shame once my parents and I found out about the vape and she said that this made her want to die, thats why she got sent there. I don't know what to do!;Hello!

1c8f8sf;Bad and entitled troubles ;Own-Month-5263;I consider myself to be on an even keel, while breaking my sobriety streak for the endless time. I hate being drunk and high but will always fall into this state when completely stressed and disgusted as I am with myself. I fucked up at my job, I’m a software analyst and have been answering questions wrong. I’ve been working hard but haven’t delt with situations up to par. I’m trying desperately to change things, however the job mostly relies on other people’s knowledge. Likewise, misinformation is rampant and my boss, the decider of my fucking fate, just doesn’t like me. I’m so fucking sad and worried during times like this and I’ve already chosen to embarrass myself in front of my friends with this petty stupid fucking problem that I know they will hold to my death. I feel so fucking sad over this, and I know that hopefully, one day soon, this will blow over. Better or for worse, I will get to be fucking happy again. But right now, I feel worse than dying. I feel like the end would be better than getting over this. It is a madness that kills me, especially when I’m fucked up. I am very fucked up right now, and I just can’t think. I can’t think of what else I should consider. How I plan to execute a comeback, a fucking hail marry! Is that even possible? I need it to be fucking possible, I need someone to believe that I can get over this and get the job I want and not have to fucking feel sorry for me. Especially when they could’ve solved the same problems. I hate communicating, I hate the constant editing that I have to do, and how it never ends. It’s not like I want to have to continue to live through other people’s standards which hurt more than my own. But likewise know that I have so very little against the worst to come. I’m probably not going to survive this position, I plan to work 11-12hrs a day, obsessively, to the point that I go insane in order to feel safe. This is largely due to the fact that I hate change so much, and I like the sick, while sad comfort that I’ve created for myself. I’m in the freest of cages in my existence and wouldn’t trade it for any other reality that could possibly be better. And perhaps, if god we’re to exist, this is what it would want of me. To be the interesting lab rat of insane suffering and worry and sickness and hate, self disgust, suicidal ideation, and obscured anger!!!!!! I’ve worked so hard and I’m still a FAILURE!!!!!!!!

I’m at home everyday rotting in bed and wondering when I’ll get the balls to do it. I know my family would care and it would ruin them. That’s one of the main reasons I haven’t done it. I just can’t leave that pain on them and especially my younger siblings. I wonder if any of my old friends who don’t talk to me at all anymore will be really affected. I especially think of this one guy I used to be sorta friends with and I had a huge crush on him and when I eventually confessed my feelings to him, he respectfully told me he didn’t feel the same way and just saw me as a friend. I was still lowkey obsessed with him after and would get so nervous anytime we interacted at a party or smth. It was rly pathetic tbh. It got kinda awkward after that and he stopped talking to me and I think he thought I was weird bc I was very open about my feelings. I wonder how he would react if he heard I killed myself. I wonder if he’d get over it in a couple weeks. I usually think about my family and how much it would fuck them up and get really sad and disappointed with myself but I just started thinking about this past crush again because he showed up in my dream. I wonder if he’d even find out. I think i had what’s called limerence over him and it just hurts so bad that I could never have him because he just doesn’t see me in that way. He probably has forgotten about me tbh. I don’t even know how I would do it cuz most methods have a survival rate and I do not want to fail and end up in even more pain.

1c8e2tv;Fucked up and am now on the edge of it;Alternative-Cap3710;"18 years old here and I'm attending community college. Been depressed and suicidal for a very long time to the point of looking into suicide methods but I just fucked up badly. According to my health class's syllabus, I'm given three unexcused absences before going down letter grades. The semester ends in a month... so I took them. I was tired, exhausted, and mentally sick and could not mentally make it to class. I studied for another class and also relaxed during it. After those three days I headed back to class, which was Wednesday the 17th. Welp, I just got an email from the school saying I got booted from the class. I didn't even get lowered a letter grade like they warned in the syllabus, I just got booted out and am told that this will affect my ability to have financial aid, which I need. I showed up Wednesday so I must've been marked absent when I wasn't. To clarify, you're allowed to miss three days but can't miss more than that according to the syllabus. Yes I emailed my professor, several hours ago actually, but she likely won't respond because of course she won't. This is the breaking point it's so hard to keep going.It... kind of feels silly, in a way that something like this is what pushed me to be ready for it. My parents will kill me when they find this out. And of course this is my fault, I should know better than to fucking skip class lmfaooo but of course not. Sure, I shouldn't be getting booted because I technically listened to the syllabus. But I skipped class... I knew not to do that and I went ahead and did it anyway. As much as I hate saying it, I deserve the consequences from this.So here's what I might do. After a lot of researching (which is hard enough because people are often too cowardly to tell the truth) I think I know what I might do sometime in the upcoming days.... There's a train station. It's not far from my house. On my bus to my school every morning Mon through Thurs we pass through it due to a bus terminal being next to it. There are digital signs showing when a train stops there. Due to my love for trains and public transport in general I have noticed that when a train is coming, and it's not mentioned on the digital signs, it won't stop and is actually passing by at brutal force. There is no way you'd live through that thing crushing you. I mean, some people do apparently. But I think I might risk it and jump in front. I'm in a place where I can't just stroll into a gun store and buy one or else I'd just do that. Would be nice too, I'd buy it, put it in my backpack, take a train very far away, walk to where no one is, and shoot myself. I would hang myself since apparently it's basically painless if you do it right (but sure, horrifying if you fuck it up) but I don't have a tall structure to do it on without people seeing me and I don't have a place to do it at all.Do not bother with the whole ""don't do it"" schtick I have seen it plenty times before. People love me, people would miss me, yes I'm aware. However, keep in mind you have no idea who I am. What if I'm a rapist pedophile? Or modern-day Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin? you have absolutely no idea who I am. Someone saved Jeffery Dahmer from suicide so shhhh. I don't want your crummy advice that's clearly just meant so you think you saved a life.

1c8dqpf;I'm curious as to why I should live. ;loopychan;I have no job aspirations. I am a non-passing trans woman. I am considered by many to be pretty but I'm pretty in an androgynous manner. I look like a 14 year old boy pretty much.. and I don't want that. I used to have crying fits about it. Now I just feel empty honestly. Like I've accepted my fate.. and weirdly enough, I feel more at peace. But I don't want my life to be like this. My best friend killed herself on April 21st last year. I can't tell you the amount of crying I did. First I was angry, then depressed, felt as if I could have saved her. She told everyone she had terminal cancer and she wanted to go on her own terms. I'm not sure if I truthfully believe her. Did it get better as time went on? Honestly, yes. I still miss her of course. And it's almost been a year..I have a dream. My dream is to one day adapt my stories. I have a couple movie ideas, ideas for an animated series. If I can at least adapt it into a comic, that alone would make me happy. But I don't have hope for that to happen. And even if I were to accomplish this, when all is said and done at the end of the day, I still hate and resent myself for who I am. I truthfully am a kind person but I can be really mean. I don't know why or what comes over at times but I think it may be envy. It's one of the seven deadly sins I think.. and for good reason. I don't want others to suffer but I don't like seeing other people who have it better constantly bemoaning every single nusiance in their lives. I just turned 23 last month and I still feel mentally 12. Coincidentally that was the age when my life began to go to shit and me and my family lost pretty much everything. My mom became a alcoholic and started abusing drugs. I've been homeless several times. At 16, when my mom was in jail and my dad was in the hospital, I was homeless and all alone. I live with my dad and brother and while I do love them, IMy friend said that suicide was inherently a selfish act. But isn't it selfish to want to keep someone alive just so YOU don't hurt? When that person has done everything to be happy and nothing works and you want them to continue being unhappy? Isn't that selfish? I don't understand people. I also struggle with ADHD really bad and as you can expect, it has controlled my life. I am an alcoholic as well. I don't want to quit. So is there an actual reason for me to live? I'm not seeing it honestly.;I have no job aspirations. I am a non-passing trans woman.

1c8dkhj;Wasting away in university due to my mistakes.;Off-MyChest;I feel like a complete failure and that i'm falling behind in life.I'm 26(M) and i have started my computer science degree over in my current university at 21 and up until now, 5 years later i only have 11 out of 31 subjects completed.I start every semester with the best of intentions but i end up losing steam after a week or so causing me to miss my deadlines, i have been dealt a good hand, i am in a good university with everything being paid for me and i am squandering it all and what makes it even more frustating is that i DO care and i do want to be better, i just can't keep disciplined.My mother is paying for my studies and, even thought she doesn't say it, she's disappointed and the worst part of it is that she, despite always continuing to support me no matter what, does had to quit her job for health reasons which adds to her and my worry and stress about my studies, i have been taking this degree for 5 years (or 7 if you count 2 years in a different university before starting over in this one) and at best i am only going to finish it when i'm 28, all of this while everyone around me is already doing something with their lives when meanwhile i am subject to judgement from other family members and probably even my mother for me not having my degree yet, adding to all of this i have OCD, depression and social anxiety on top of having to face my mother again after screwing up last semester again. I just keep making the same bad decisions that i just can't understand how stelupid they were until they hit me back, i am in this situation due to my own failings and feel like i am not worthy of simpathy from anyone. I wonder how many people are going through something like this.I know i CAN do it, i know i CAN get this degree, i hope i find whatever is missing to get this done before it's too late.i just feel like disappearing and despite knowing i will probably not have the courage to end it all but i simply cannot stop thinking about it.

1c8d7xo;i'm tired of being treated like i'm insignificant. i'm tired of everything;Mysterious_Most913;"F18, I don't know who or where to take this to but this subreddit was the best choice to go. I've struggled a lot in my life, I dealt with death, grief, bullying, depression, and suicidal thoughts for over 7 years now. With this I've suffered with god awful trauma that I haven't really processed. I probably have PTSD. I'm really emotional, I cry so easily it's actually embarrassing. I see something remotely related to traumatic incidents I've experienced in the past and I break. I struggle talking to others about it and finding the right words. I'm taken over with extreme jealousy when I see someone with something that I've lost during my trauma. I never speak up for myself from fear and being so sheltered my entire life. I wish I was someone else everyday. In the back of my head I wonder what I did to deserve the stuff that happened to me. I was just a child. Anyways... I'm just lost. I want to be better so badly. But I don't know if I have the heart to go on. I wish silently to myself that I'll die randomly. ""Maybe someone will shoot me."" ""Maybe I'll get into a car crash and die from the impact."" I don't know if I actually want to die, but rather I want to just be someone else. I don't deserve anybody in my life. My friends are the best things to ever happen to me, my sister is my lifeline. But I fear that I'm not strong enough to hold on. Don't even get me started on my job, my manager is a cunt who think's I'm an idiotic child. I can't do anything to please her. The only thing keeping me from quitting is my other coworkers and that I need the money. Only 3 more months and I can quit, but can I survive? Only 4 more months and I'm free from this disgusting life and I move for university.

1c8co1f;Tired of being a burden and existing ;Ok-Pianist-9729;F19 cant drive yet because I can't afford a car or driving lessons yet it'll probably be months/ a couple of years before I can get one and my parents refuse to teach to me.They drive me to work and school but I have stopped showing up to school because I don't want to deal with having to get a ride or paying for a ride. I don't know how to use the bus lines and no one around me knows how to either, but I'm planning on asking a social worker whenever I can but idk when that will be.I work 6 minutes away but it's a couple of miles so I can't walk and my school Is a couple of miles away so I can walk, well I guess I theoretically could. Would that be unrealistic? I can't ask my parents for anything like an extra ride to pick up my medications (but my medications cannot be delivered so I end up just not picking them uphalf the time) every month I beg my mom for a ride to get them because the pharmacy is 3 miles away. And It takes a few weeks until she gives in and I just know they hate me over there. They keep complaining about having to give me rides rightfully so. They will cuss me out or huff and puff. They have always complained about having to feed me or buy me clothes growing up. I am so sick of living.I do understand that no one is entitled to care about me anyways so I'm looking for advice to do everything myself.The other day my dad picked me up from school and he was crying and I'm like why are you crying and it's because he is sick of having to drive me to school, and he is sick of having to work. I am considering dropping out after this semester. Even if I get a car, car insurance will be $500 for my age and I won't be able to afford it. I have no credit to lease a car. If I buy a used car it will probably break down and then total and the repair would cost more than the car. If I got a bike I know that shit will get stolen.  on a part time job and I already struggle working part time with school anyway, so working full time and school will kill me. I already struggle with being able to function and wake up everyday, and with taking care of myself. I haven't brushed my teeth in 2 weeks.  If I work full time at my job i will make about $2,400 a month before taxes and because I know I wouldn't be able to survive on my own without multiple jobs anyway that's why I haven't worked full time yet. I'm trying to get jobs in walking distance but no one is hiring me. My bed has been broken for 6 months and I can't even go to sleep. If it's not one thing it's another. I am so tired of existing.I have struggled with suicidal ideation for years but I'm planning to actually take my own life by the end of the year if it doesn't get better, or if I don't get better, because I know in reality everything that is happening to me is really my fault.;F19 cant drive yet because I can't afford a car or driving lessons yet it'll probably be months/ a c;;1;3;2024-04-20 00:33:14;2024-04-20;Saturday;00:33:14;2788;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:49.585474
1c8cku0;I might die soon, completely alone;One_Yogurtcloset3455;I don't even need to commit suicide, the illness might do it for me. Why should I even live. I have nothing to live for. People always have stories how they were saved by this one friend or how they miss a friend who died. No one would miss me, no one cares. I never had close friends, never had someone to talk or someone to trust. My whole life I was just beaten and abused, by the people supposedly closest to me. And no one to tell, no one to vent to. The only person that cared for me died this year. I tried my best always. I did everything right to the extend that I could and yet I was and still am continuously punished by life. Whenever I try to improve I get a reality check. Last autumn should've been when things start to go uphill for me for once. I went to uni. I started getting to know people and it was starting to go well... and then. As always this disease hit. No problem, sick for a week or two and back on my feet, right? nope. I am still sick. Since Last October I am in pain, what should've been a relatively easy fix, wasn't really that easy, because not even the doctors care for my life. They didn't help me properly. I've been in pain for months, I couldn't work out for months, I failed my classes all the other people moved on, while I didn't, what could've developed into friendships went nowhere. As if that wasn't enough my Grandmother died during that time. Now I got truly no one. I always thought the future might be worth living for, back when I was a kid. Now is the future and I don't like it one bit. As a kid I might have had a chance to have people to care for me but now it feels like it's way too late. Everyone expects me to have all those social and emotional skills that I don't have.  I might survive this disease, but I don't really know what for tbh. I got nothing worth living for. I am tired and exhausted, barely can get out of bed, am completely alone and isolated. And if I do die no one would even know for weeks.

1c8cizg;Life sucks sometimes;Aredditorrobot;"I’ve been struggling with my mental health for several years now. Sometimes it’s really bad; a lot worse than other times.Sometimes I have no motivation to do anything so I just end up sitting inside all day, calling in sick, and feeling miserable about myself. At the end of the day I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and disappointment.I’m truly alone. No one understands. And no one stands by me. But it’s okay, I get it. I don’t know, maybe I’m just not worth it since every single person in my life that I’ve ever let into my head and confided my terrible thoughts in have left me.I’m sorry for being so miserable. I don’t even feel sorry for myself, I feel sorry that I’m such a bother to others. And I’ve been doing a little better for the past month…a couple of weeks since I last cried my eyes dry…Have you ever cried so hard that your eyes went blurry for a good day or two? Yeah…me too. Anyways…today I felt a familiar feeling rush over me. A sense of dread, of sadness that is incomprehensible to anyone unless they’ve been where I am. And guilt, and loneliness. I felt angry at myself, like I was just such a failure that nothing in my life could ever work out properly. I wanted to get high or numb my feelings or feel pain so bad that I wouldn’t have to feel anything else, or think about the terrible thoughts that were spiraling through my mind. And that’s when it hit me. I felt like committing. Again. It’s not new; I’ve felt it many many times before. So many times I lost count…I used to keep track, or try to, of how many times I had a thought like that. But it got so many that, I no longer could, and more importantly I no longer cared to. Seeing how many times I failed to commit just only further reminded me of my failures. My failures as a human and as a person and as someone in this hellbound world. I love God, I know that sounds confusing and contradictory since, if you love God so much why commit?I don’t know…maybe because I want to finally go be at rest and peace with Him. Anyways, I really wanted to end myself today. I listened to my favorite songs and tried to make it right with all my loved ones.I still feel the overwhelming urge to commit. That’s why I’m here, in this subreddit, hoping one of you might be able to help.And I’m sorry if I’m being such a pain. I know there are so so many people who have it way worse than me so I’m just being a wimp and a crybaby and I shouldn’t be overreacting this much. I know. But every time I’m in a crowded room my mind goes blurry. And even if I’m not alone, I feel alone. But yeah. I’ve attempted before. And failed. I guess I’m even bad at removing myself. God is there anything I’m good at…But yeah, I’m sorry for yapping. I will say it flat out: I want to ki// myself.

Everyone jusy keeps leaving me and I don’t know how to deal anymore. I have dreams. I have plans for my life. But for the last few months it’s been like I’ve woken up with a sock over my eyes. I barley talk to anyone apart from my girlfriend but I feel so embarrassed telling her even half of how I feel at the moment life jusy seems so undoable for me at the moment. I jusy want a way to be free of all the pain i feel. To feel like myself again. I’ve been watching loads of videos of me as a child I jsuy want that me back. I want to smile again I want to be happy. I often dream about jusy killing muself. I used to be a coke addict (I know not good) I attempted several times and since I got off it and met my girlfriend life jusy seemed to be getting better. But now I can’t do it anymore I’ve become so ill I can hardly look at myself. I just feel so alone through everything nobody gives a shit. Every time I try to talk to someone they always find a way to use it against me and I jsuy can’t do it anymore.;I’m 15. I’m so ill I’ve thrown up at least 12 times a day for the last couple of weeks.

1c8bl0p;It's time to vanish.;Dazzling-Ear1630;Allow me to delve deep into my life's struggles, and I understand if it seems daunting to read through it all. While I can't claim to have given my all in achieving success, I've certainly fought tooth and nail just to keep going. At this point, I'm at a crossroads, hoping for factual insights rather than sympathetic words to change my perspective.Recently turning 36, my journey has been a relentless battle against a cascade of misfortunes and health challenges. Expressing it all might fall short of capturing its full weight, but I feel compelled to try earnestly to find a reason to continue forward.Here's a chronological account of the major events, devoid of their emotional impact on me: Age 5: Battling eye cancer, leading to the removal of my eye (resulting in a disability). Age 6: Fitted with a prosthetic eye, which became a target for bullying. Age 11: My father's incarceration for four years coincided with the onset of OCD and anxiety. Age 13 onwards: Struggles with acne, though it has improved over time. Age 14: Diagnosed with Osgood Schlatter syndrome, preventing me from playing soccer. Age 18: Meniere's Disease struck, causing vertigo attacks and a persistent jet engine-like sound in my ears. Age 24: Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis, forcing me to give up my passion for playing drums in bands. Age 27: Tinnitus worsened, now tormenting me with loud ringing in both ears around the clock. Age 35: Underwent a radical treatment for MS, AHSCT, involving highly intensive chemotherapy. Age 36: Although I've recovered from AHSCT, I'm haunted by the looming specter of further health complications due to my unfortunate genetics.These events paint a picture of relentless adversity, but what weighs heaviest on my mind currently is the erosion of my cognitive abilities. Despite obtaining a BA/MA/Teaching Diploma, I feel like a sham—a mere holder of certificates that signify education while my brain betrays me. With 32 lesions on my brain and 2 on my spine, my memory is abysmal, leaving me struggling to recall most of my life experiences.Arriving in the US this February, I initially saw it as an opportunity for a fresh start. However, the cutthroat competition and relentless grind here have left me feeling inadequate once again. As a result, I find myself driving for DoorDash, a job that offers no fulfillment or prospect for a brighter future.Do I envision spending the rest of my life in this role? Absolutely not. Do I possess the skills or health to pursue something better? Sadly, no. I feel like a fraction of the man I was meant to be, robbed of my potential by relentless illness.The thought of continuing to live feels increasingly futile. I can't shake the belief that no one will ever truly love or accept me. While others build families and futures, I fear passing on my flawed genes and lack of financial stability, feeling like nothing more than a destitute failure.Moreover, I must confess that the weight of these burdens has led me to contemplate a dire solution. I am now considering suicide as a means to end this relentless cycle of suffering, as I find no value in carrying on amidst the overwhelming sense of despair and hopelessness.Thank you for reading my story.Bash;Allow me to delve deep into my life's struggles, and I understand if it seems daunting to read throu;;0;2;2024-04-19 23:43:09;2024-04-19;Friday;23:43:09;3222;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:49.597490

Is he just wanting to work things out because of the kids and because I can't support myself alone. I'm stuck and the only way out is to end my life.

1c89gsv;Unsure about living if I keep causing so much emotional pain/trauma for people I cared so much for. Have tried suicide but debating trying a different method soon.;Original_Version_365;I’m getting so tired of making mistakes so often with the people in my life who I love and care most about that cause them pain, trauma, depression, and/or anxiety. I know it's selfish and would cause more pain for friends and family, but it often feels like the best option because I keep making mistakes and I think it'd be better to die instead of living a lifetime of taking chances at mistakes like this that seriously hurt/traumatize people over and over again. Most recently I (25M) got mad at my (ex?)gf (22F) when I was saying something to her and she was giving me a mean look and starting to look away as though she's trying to show she's mad and ignoring me. When I saw that I got really mad and grabbed her by the arms/shoulders and also made her head face me and scolded her for making that face and looking away when I'm talking to her. It startled her and she apologized for it and I apologized for getting mad like that, but I'm not sure if I apologized for grabbing her like I did. She's had a bad history of physical abuse from people and it was triggering for her. There's a bunch of other stuff that's happened leading up to that night, that's way too long to put here and I'm getting so tired. What's important to know is I tried killing myself a week ago through electrocution with an extension cord and bathtub, suffocate by plastic bag and pillow with weights on it, and drowing myself in the sink. Wondering when I might just have the balls to throw myself over a ledge, find a cord to wrap around my neck, shove a knife in my chest or fall on it, or stick a fork in a toaster. Today I contemplated the toaster by standing in front of it. I cried myself to sleep last night and cried again some more earlier today. I almost don't care anymore (again) what God or anyone will think about me doing this and really feel like such a burden and source of anxiety for my parents regarding my safety, and a source of both anxiety and depression for my gf who I have cared about and love so much, but I guess not enough if I'm making the mistakes I have and she doesn't deserve that nor anyone else I get in a relationship with. I don't want to be alone but I'd much rather die alone by my hands than live with no one where we can live and care for each other and have kids. On the other hand maybe I should die so no kids of mine inherit any of my bad habits and thinking patterns. I don't know what to do and I can't just quit college right before I graduate this May to go to some in-patient care or something. Feels like it'd be so much easier and freeing and better to die. Now that I think about it more I might try to arrange the toaster at the sink so I can better drown myself from being seized up by electrical shock.;I’m getting so tired of making mistakes so often with the people in my life who I love and care most;;0;1;2024-04-19 22:08:55;2024-04-19;Friday;22:08:55;2745;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:49.618271

1c89ba7;My abortion story and my sucidial thoughts;Logical_Chemist9245;I was 7 weeks pregnant. I had severe abdominal pain for over a week. It was so painful. Sharp stabbing, constant dull aching. I knew something wasn't right. I told my doctors I didnt want to go through this anymore and she directed me to a womans health clinic (who provide abortions)  I went to a womens health clinic because I thought I was ok with abortion after previously believing I would never have one. I guess I was desperately in pain.  When I was there the sonographer scanned me and told me that the pregnancy measured 6 weeks + and had no heartbeat. I was led to believe there was no life in my womb. Based off of that, and the pain, I chose to opt for the abortion pills as I freaked out and didn't want to carry on being pregnant with what I perceived as a lifeless fetus in me after they said it didnt have a heartbeat.  I didn't know about rescanning and checking for false positives.. it was my first pregnancy and I was scared and in so much pain. I feel ashamed that I didn't ask for further confirmation or didn't know enough to think to ask for further confirmation and nothing else was advised to me. But I did have an ultrasound that dated me over 6 weeks and they said they could see the pregnancy and it didnt have a detectable heartbeat. I acted based off of that information.  I feel disgust at this situation I find myself in. The truth is.. I am pro-life. But because I was directed to an abortion (womens health clinic) after telling my doctor Im not sure if I want to continue to put up with this pregnancy pain anymore, I was robbed of the chance for a confirmation scan and left with incomplete confirmation of the passing.  I don't know what I'm writing here for. I guess its just to say I am a woman who went to an abortion clinic and was told explicitly that my baby didnt have a heartbeat. I was then left to decide what to do next, on my own, scared and alone and being in great pain, I acted on that information and aborted the pregnancy.  How do I move on? I really am struggling.  I reached out for more information but because it was ten years ago they have deleted all my scan reports due to GDPR.  I don't want to believe I took a life. And at the time I didn't think I was. But it gave me an insight into a realm I never want to be involved with again and gave me huge derealisation.  I hope every abortion clinic in the world gets shut down.

1c88x5k;Feeling so hopeless and restless ;dep_Taro0102;I don't even know whats wrong with me these days , I've told myself that id try my best to not feel suicidal but it just doesn't work that way does it. It's so tiring I keep procrastinating, running away from my problems and things at hand like study for a big test that is 14 days from now and Im barely prepared, i already fucked up another test previously but I just couldn't bring myself to commit I kept pushing it. My suicidal thoughts well I keep them away by distracting myself watching anime and stuff cause everytime I open my book im brought back to those thoughts and now  I'm addicted to devices I just can't bring myself to study anymore. I know I can't meet my parents expectations and im fucked for it . I mean I have no reason to feel tired or feel this way cause I'm on my phone I'm distracting myself to not feel suicidal anymore then why doesn't this feeling go away, last year and this year so far hasn't been great so far, but nothing seems to work out I can't study , I don't feel happy, i feel restless , suicidal I have all these passive suicidal ideations, mood swings that are so freaking weird as in i feel like I'm insane or something.I have these weird impulses like I have to harm myself ( I am familiar with self harming but I have stayed clean for a few months now), i don't understand why now , why do things have to be this way , ik i can do something but I just can't? I really dont know why , I feel like killing myself is the only option  but i don't want to kms? This in between feeling sucks so bad cause if it were the former or latter I'd have my answer but i don't cause I'm stuck inbetween of wanting to not live but not wanting to die.Ik the most practical advice is stop thinking of these things, put your devices away and fucking study do your best until the exam it'll be hard but push through, i just can't, i wanna give up. Overall ik i sound confused and pretty much out of my mind, it's cause i am, i really don't know what to do or how to deal with this...death feels so comforting, enveloping into the darkness than breathing in light, shielding myself from the pain that somehow became my everyday alarm clock that I can't even snooze or stop only shut it down or let it ring, sucks really imaoo (P.s sorry for the longg text);I don't even know whats wrong with me these days , I've told myself that id try my best to not feel ;;4;1;2024-04-19 21:45:50;2024-04-19;Friday;21:45:50;2281;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:49.624218

In the last 3 years, my depression has became worse and I would have spontaneous suicidal tendencies. My first attempt was with pills that left me hallucinating and vomiting. My second attempt I consumed bleach (don’t recommend at all:/) which left me with gastric pain for a week. For this last attempt(I hope to be the last), I will use an exit bag. I’ve already bought some of the material, so I’m just waiting for it to arrive.Before considering this option, please note that I have tried to seek professional help and assistance. It worked for a while but eventually didn’t. I also have tried hotlines. The reasons why I considered doing this is because of my life. I’m a chronic asthmatic whose always going through attacks with two broken parents. My father is an inmate who’s coming home this year but he’s been away since I was in middle school.

It comes and goes, but I have not been eating as much and drinking Ensure's between meals.

1c87dh8;Imposter syndrome and my suicidal desire;crimson-poges;Hello. I'm a 21 year old male living an extremely unhealthy life and suffering from significant mental anguish. I believe my own lack of self discipline since a child, social norms and the desire to be accepted, early access to the internet and a lack of support has led me to become the person I am today.I am blatantly a failure, involuntary obsessed with the deep and unrelenting depressive and suicidal thoughts that I constantly have roaming through my head. It's all I can think about...I can confidently say I most likely will never commit suicide because I'm terrified, unless I had access to something like a firearm which is unlikely due to the country I live in. Despite this, I am so desperate to do so, and for the 7-8 years of my life have not been able to break this thought process. It for this reason I start to question myself on whether I truly am suicidal. If I'm so desperate to kill myself wouldn't the thoughts have convinced me to go out with a different method? I'm so scared of death yet crave to not be alive and enduring the hell I already go through most days. This makes me wonder if I am suicidal or am I feeling such self pity that I convince myself that I'm a victim in order to justify why I feel so blank inside.Inside my head is just suicidal thoughts, often with a complete lack of sadness as if I've overcome the depression and am left with the aftermath and scar tissue. I hope people understand the importance of protecting children from the horrors of the internet. It has ruined me, it has done such irreversible damage to my brain, it has been the cause of a life of pure self insecurity, addiction, loneliness, and most of all, the feeling of never being okay with not being okay.;Hello.

1c85ti0;Suicide is actually Selfless;itehexael;Given the hyper-consumerist nature of capitalist society, it would be a net benefit if people ended their lives prematurely. Some other things of note:    1. eating animal byproducts is largely unethical save for select instances    2. end of life care constitutes over 10% of healthcare costs    3. bodily autonomy is sacred and must be upheld    4. there is no real harm outside of emotional distress as long as there are no immediate dependents    5. personal suffering is reason enough to justify euthanasia    Note: I am seriously contending with mental health issues and have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and trying to find a way out by mitigating harm. I tried posting this to CMV but it was immediately flagged. I am not convinced by faith or spirituality nor am I trying to spite anyone in particular.

1c84km1;I did something unforgivable ;SkyConscious6961;"I was talking to this guy online and we were sharing our fantasies. I admitted that I feel guilt over my sexual fantasies and he admitted to having sexual thoughts about his brothers kids. he also admitted to being raped when he was younger so I sympathized with him a little but i was mostly weirded out and suspicious but he said he wouldn't act on them and advised me not to act on mine as well. We kept talking for a bit and I don't even remember what it was about. for a moment I thought ""am I any better then him?"" because I had bad fantasies about being a kid and bad stuff happening to me so I did sympathize with him only because of what he went through. but the fact it was specific people he could be close to threw me off but we kept talking and I figured if he doesn't admit to anything I can't report him. I think we had a sexuak convo after but I can't remember.now I've realized, I've basically condoned and was complicit with pedophilia and a person who may have done things to kids because I wanted attention. This is the worst thing anyone can do and I need to kill myself. I'm going to find a gun and shoot myself in the head. the guilt is unbearableI would 100 percent stop talking to him if he admitted to anything and I even considered asking him if he did so i could try and report anything he says. but i was conflicted and in a way felt I was no better then him. I know he could easily be lying but I didn't think much about it then.then i remember those stories about parents knowing sexual abuse is happening but don't do anything. I basically did that in a way, because he could have easily lied to me by saying he didn't act on it. I knew that too but didn't immediately stop talking. I genuinely can't remember what I said, I didn't send nudes or say anything overly sexual we just talked about some stuff before he blocked me after I refused him nudesI literally was complicit with possible abuse and I can't take it anymore I didn't encourage any of the fantasies of what he went through and I even considered reporting him but he didn't admit to a crime. I told myself I'm not any better because of my rape and stuff fantasies and I only kept talking to him cuz he opened up about his sexual abusebut I am basically condoning possible sexual abuse and pedophilia by doing that.. no he didn't admit to anything but why the fuck did I keep talking to him? I guess I felt like I had no one else or wasn't any better then himI want to say I've talked to a LOT of creeps online.. I've explicitly asked multiple of them if they harm children due to their kinks (which mine are similar) and they say no but still sometimes i blocked them. I was very hyper aware of doing the wrong thing and constantly scared someone was abusing kids. I would even ask innocent people if they harm kids because I was so obsessed with the idea of it and scared of children being harmed. I didn't know how to bring it up in this situation I need to kill myself, what I've done is too unforgivableI have blocked people online after they've said weird things like that and I've blocked a guy after he said he would do stuff with teenagers. I don't know why I didn't immediately end the conversation, I don't know what I said after. I don't think I felt comfortable saying anything sexual after but I don't remember. I don't remember anything I said after except that I declined nudes.I felt just as bad as him or worse because of my fantasies and I tried not to say anything judging , we just talked about childhood trauma and I talked to him about what happened to me as a kid, I think it stopped being sexual after he revealed that fantasy but I genuinely don't remember. I Did NOT encourage his fantasy or anything he said about kids, we had a discussion about childhood trauma and what happened to him and what he thinks happened to me I don't remember if it turned sexual afterHe claims to not have acted on anything and I didn't feel as comfortable having sexual conversations after he said that, I just wanted someone to talk to who has been through similar things, I've been told I condoned pedophilia by doing this and did things with a possible abuserGoodbye.

1c84ird;I want to stop this pain and void;kivili_;So I have diagnosed depression mixed with anxiety but depression is more prevalent. I also have a bpd. Several days ago someone I had one night stand with triggered my abandonment pain and after that I have been literally dying. At first I was crying with unbearable pain, I was unable to exist for a moment, then I spoke to my friend and it kind of calmed me. But after that I started having very very dense, dark depression and it is caused by not having anyone to share my pain with or rely on. Because I got this pain from attaching myself to almost a stranger, I feel that i should keep distance from people now and I suffered because I didn't trust my gut instinct and I have a gut instinct that everybody's scary and ready to betray me. Do I cannot reach out to everyone, I am literally burning from inside with this loath, desire not to be, the enourmous hopelesness about life generally, I feel like I'm shit, I failed in my studies, I create art but I have a feeling that I'm shitty and worthless in that too and on the top of that I have nobody who loves me enough to fill my void. I feel nausea and shivering/cold. This happens to me when I enter extreme depression. I just want anyone to read and see how bad I am feeling, I feel like I'm running out of air..I am suicidal since 6 years old.

1c84hqh;Too weak to die, too stubborn to live;Electronic-Degree922;I've  been deeply hurt by my parents, who are narcissists, leaving scars that seem impossible to heal. Their actions have inflicted generational trauma upon me, burdening me with pain and resentment. Despite their portrayal of nobility and virtue, they've failed me in countless ways, causing disappointment and disillusionment. From a young age, I've witnessed their flaws and hypocrisy, which have left a lasting impact on my life. Despite their material provision, their emotional neglect and manipulation have made it difficult for me to trust others and form meaningful connections. Now, as an adult (asexual n celibate), I wish to break free from their toxic influence and create a better life for myself but they won't even let me do that. My father disappointed me when I was only 12 years old, which when I later brought up was obviously brushed off. I should have died that day. It was my mistake that I chickened out and threw that knife away. I was never the same after that day. I was just an innocent kid. They accused me of horrible things. That day I knew if anything were to happen to me, if I was ever to be SAed in the future, they won't shy away to blame me and kill me for it. (TBH as an adult I was not surprised when something similar actually happened and my mum told me to zip it.)If I were to bring it all up again today and expose them all, it would not matter as everyone is like them. This whole family, this whole town is the same. No matter how bad they hurt me they are still my parents and I still like them as parents and a few of their good deeds, but the damage is irreversible.God gave me another chance to finally rest myself permanently. But I screwed it up, I made a mistake. I insisted on driving, that wasn’t the mistake. My instincts made me wear a seat belt. That was the biggest mistake I had ever made in my life. I put on my seatbelt. That slight mistake caused me to live and suffer through it all again. Only I was supposed to die, everyone else was just supposed to be unharmed. Quite the opposite happened. Even though that accident was not intentional, I would have been really grateful if I had died that day. I am still alive, IDK for how long. It's becoming unbearable every day. I hope karma will serve everyone accordingly. I don't want them to die...I love them but I will never forgive them.;I've  been deeply hurt by my parents, who are narcissists, leaving scars that seem impossible to hea;;0;1;2024-04-19 18:43:21;2024-04-19;Friday;18:43:21;2350;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:50.642164

Sometimes I pray that I'll die at work my family doesn't have to experience another suicide in the family. But at this point that's all it is, just going day to day, so others aren't saddened by my choices. Every. Fucking. Time. It's always someone else over me, yeah I know suicide is a big deal but fuck. How many times am I going to ask for help and just get told the same things, or not be listened to, or belittled or neglected entirely.

1c81iry;Final choice;Ok_Exchange_3129;"kind of an update from my last 2 posts, ig. I figured out that hitting my major arteries ain't gonna be as easy as I thought it would be, especially with just glass. So I've decided that the only way I can die is to jump. I've tried researching multiple ways to kms peacefully, but ig I'm not destined to die in peace. It's a hard pill to swallow, but I ig it is what it is. I live in a 15-story apartment, but since the rooftop would be locked during midnight, I'd have to jump from my balcony (10 stories), lol. It's gonna take me a lot of courage, but comparatively from a few days back, I can say that I feel a bit more ready to jump. So even if I don't get the full courage to do it tn itself, I'm definitely, without a doubt, doing it before Monday, I gotta write a few letters to my family as well anyway. I'm just scared that I won't die instantly when I hit the ground, I don't wanna agonisingly feel every inch of my bones shattering and having to be soaked in my own blood for more than 5 mins. I want it to get over as fast as it could get so I can finally reach the skies and never come back to this hideous earth lmao. I'm also specifically doing it at midnight since that's the period no one's roaming around the apartment complex, so a number of ppl won't have to witness me jumping. I also domt wanna get recorded cus ppl are assholes here, lol. I just wish I could've met my bf and my sister one last time before leaving, i wish he had listened to me as at least on that part, i miss him and love hik so much i just want him to be happy and successful even tho he treated me terribly the last few months. Idk, he'll be relieved when I die cus he (and most probably his friends) frames me as if im some ""manipulater"" just bc i once said that im planning ro kms, which has lead me further into my suicidal thoughts.

1c80cyj;I hate my self and I want to end it all, what should I do?;Jumpy-Duty1930;I am 23 years old. I feel like a failure for still living with my parents in a small house of just over 50 square meters, relying on them for support because I haven’t been able to earn money. Since childhood, I’ve been impulsive, often engaging in foolish antics, playing the ‘class clown’ to attract attention and feel less lonely. But being a ‘clown’ was never my true self. Gradually, my jokes became stale (or even embarrassing in some situations). In high school, I stopped using them and decided to be my real self: a loner, introverted, struggling to fit in, and mediocre at everything from sports to academics. I’ve recently graduated from university but haven’t found a job due to a lack of skills and poor projects for my portfolio. In May, I will receive my degree, and if I don’t have a job by June, my parents will kick me out and disown me, leaving me to survive alone in a harsh city.    Am I depressed? Of course, it’s obvious that a loser like me has been depressed since the age of 12, and despite the hope offered by motivational videos on YouTube or self-help books filling bookstores, I still feel like I don’t belong in this world. Everyone around me seems to have an easier life: they have friends, fun outings, high test scores, admission to top universities, good jobs with salaries of 500 dollars a month (which is high in my country for a recent graduate), romantic relationships during university, and some even get married and have children. All this makes me incredibly jealous and hate myself even more.    In moments of extreme anguish, only drinks and good music bring me back. Sometimes, those songs make me more determined to leave this world, but then the pain of self-harm scares me and I back down. On better days, those songs, those melodies, make me feel like ‘hope’ still exists somewhere in my unfortunate life. But I’m starting to tire of this ‘cat and mouse’ game and am beginning to think about ending it all.    What do you think of me? And what is the solution for me?  P/S: If you’re curious about the songs, here are the top 7 songs I listen to the most. I think they’re quite ordinary in terms of lyrics and melodies, but they also reflect a part of my personality and who I am  1. Creep - Ember Island  2. Everything Goes On - Porter Robinson  3. Sad Song - Illenium  4. Ocean Eyes - Billie Eilish  5. Die For You - JoJi  6. Pure Imagination - Ghostwriter Music  7. It ain't me - Selena Gomez (MV);I am 23 years old.

1c7zx4o;Loss and betrayal ;batman42142;I was with the love of my life for almost a decade. She was my best friend and the woman I loved with everything in me. I met her out of seemingly pure luck, we clicked, we could communicate, the sex was great, she was my best friend. We were together through all of the ups and downs. I met her in my early twenties. One year I got the opportunity to move us up north. I had been back and forth from Alaska my entire life. Her growing up in the south, I knew that she would love this. She seemingly did for the first several months. I ended up introducing her to a childhood friend of mine. This action would be my downfall. She ended up sleeping with him, she ended up pregnant. After we split, she moved back south. I ended up getting pretty bad into alcohol. Over the next several years I drunk myself into a deep depression and gained weight. I lost any self respect I had. I couldn't even look myself in the mirror. I constantly wanted to die. I had no one to trust, no one to talk to. I isolated myself entirely. Cut off everyone. Well now it's been years, I destroyed myself and my self esteem. I can't trust anyone even now. I tried to get my life back on track, lost a lot of weight, went to school for HVAC, etc.It still eats me alive today even though it's been a long time. She's now happily married, kids, etc. I have nothing to show. It's gotten to the point that I am not necessarily sad. I am numb. I'm indifferent. I don't care if I'm alive or dead. I'm 34 with no path. Even though I graduated, that was about 5 years ago. It's been this long. I didn't persue anything because I stopped looking forward. Just living in the past.

1c7zvfv;Dear Family;Spekter24;Dear Family,  I am tired of life, in fact I've been tired of it since I was 9yrs old. I've had thoughts and almost attempted to end it on many occasions but I feel like I'm at the point now where I will finally do it.  I am a complete and utter failure in life and too stupid to be alive. I've been contemplating which way to go. Jumping off a high platform, overdosing, shooting my self in the head or suicide by cop, or injecting my self with euthesol. If I go through with it, don't cry just know I will no longer be in pain and that failure in society of a son will be gone. I hope you forgive me if I decide to go through with it, but know I will finally be free and happy.JS;Dear Family,  I am tired of life, in fact I've been tired of it since I was 9yrs old.

One thing I know is, if I kill my self. It will be at night. I'm paranoid all the time and filled with regrets. I want to be reborn the same life so I can do things differently, or I want to die and wake up and realize that it was all a simulation of some sort. I do get signs that the 'universe' wants me to die(in a positive way, ie, the universe wants to put an end to my suffering). One thing that stops me from killing myself is that the people who have hurt me just a little recently and know that I'm sad by that, would think that I killed myself because of them. That's why I'm looking to crash my car somewhere to end it.;At nights I plan suicide. In the morning I feel really motivated.

1c7yvuy;A notepad thing ;Icy_Acanthisitta9043;Whenever I get really sad I write down my thoughts down in notepad on my phone. This is a few weeks worth. (Not suicidal, just sad).Escaping poverty, trauma, neglect, drug abuse, mental illness and betrayal. All the evil things I have done. You don’t escape ever. What happens to you stays attached to you and you can never see past it, it builds up and blinds, especially if you were never taught to deal with it, or are just bad at coping. I was 17 when I broke beyond repair. When I was in my exams and my mum came into the exam asking me for drugs. I don’t matter as much as she can look me in the eye and tell me I do, she never did care. How many more people tell me they care but simply don’t. Eventually to me happiness has become almost impossible. There is a hollow space in my mind we’re my happiness should be. All I have left is the clawing nagging of anxiety so bad I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, i can’t even drink water. The anxiety amplifies all my physical pains from neglecting my own physical body and perpetuate the cycle. I wish I could be in excruciating pain. Then I will feel some of my sins are being punished.  Then I will feel again. I will be in the moment, only wanting the pain to end, not thinking ahead or of my past. Laying traps. The current state of the world. To thrive you have to lay traps. Trick people into giving you money. Get people hooked on your product or service. Put impulse products in places were an angry child will take them or a hungry busy person will grab them without thinking. This is the genius of the game monopoly. All you do is set traps by buying them, and waiting for people to fall into them. A good example of a trap I have found was when I was registering for a business. And paid options offering a ABN for 399$. These were just scams that come up. They ask all the same questions and are not removed because they technically do provide an ABN. All big “business” is, is a trap designed  to fool people into scamming themselves. they are no different to thieves, shop lifters. Everyone old enough to become scum, is scum. They are treacherous, evil, scheming, self serving, and they have to convince you they are not. They are deserving of the most excruciating death. This is the overwhelming majority of people including myself. The world is doomed. The world is already a twisted dystopia. Sickening beyond words, devoid of higher reason. Devoid of empathy or understanding. It is scum, worse than animal filth at each other’s throats for their own benefit.Humans have lifted themselves from animal to a supposedly higher purpose. Imagine an amoeba or other microorganism being given the power of a human. All it would do is use its new found intellect to do what it already does but better. It would consume and multiply and destroy the world. This is the state of humanity. We have consumed and multiplied, turned on ourselves like the vicious immoral animals we are. We serve no higher purpose. The greatest purpose we could be given is death and to feed a pine tree or a cockroach. Drugs are better when you are alone. Filling in the blankness of tedious life. People are too tired to offer any insight a lot of the time. Ground down and exhausted from life. People are quick to say how bad drugs are, but then they themselves are a blank slate, a nothingness of a person drugs provide more to me than a meaningless conversation with someone who knows nothing.In heaven everyone is the same, in hell everyone is different. No Brocken people go to heaven.;Whenever I get really sad I write down my thoughts down in notepad on my phone.

1c7yp8w;I'm just so tired;BittahWorlock549;22M    For years, but especially the past two years, I’ve been very depressed, and it only seems to be getting worse. I’ve tried my best to figure out why. I’ve read up on Autism, which I already had a diagnosis for, but that didn’t quite seem to cut it. Did the same for ADHD, and now I’ve looked into and started identifying heavily with being transgender. I think a lot of my depression could be dysphoria and being closeted. I’m just so sick and tired of life feeling like a neverending meaningless slug. I have a few moments of joy every now and then, but I quickly return to numbness. Every time I talk to others it feels like I have to put every thought through a filter, as if I have something to hide that would be very harmful to say. I just end up quiet and secluded. Every time I try to open up, I just get ghosted or it feels like it’s forgotten the next day. I have no relations that seem sincere. There may be support groups or other resources out there, but I can’t even get myself out of bed in time, so that doesn’t help.    I feel so fucking alone and am watching myself decay every single day that passes. I can’t get myself out of bed, and often spend weeks almost completely socially isolated. Everything I do takes a tremendous amount of energy.    I don’t know how it’s supposed to feel be suicidal, but I think I have episodes of suicidal ideation very often. I just haven’t thought through how I would execute it, so nothing has happened yet. I’m just scared that one of these days I will try, and maybe even succeed. If not, I don’t think I’m far from hurting myself in other ways.

1c7xg3v;Alive due to obligations, putting others first has lead me to feel this way, surely I should put myself first for once?;L_Jiggy;My first attempt I was 15 years old, I'm in my 40s now and the ideations are always there, sometimes as background chatter and sometimes the only thought inside my head.I have children, they are young adults now, I told myself I would wait until they were grown then I could leave.My Grandparents are old, I've given myself permission to die once they are no longer here.Every single thing I read about suicide talks about how it affects those left behind, it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but it's not temporary for me, I've wanted to end my my life since I was a teenager & yes there have been some moments of happiness, but that's all the were, moments.I'm only here because I don't want to cause pain and grief to those who know me, yet I'm causing myself pain every day that I continue to live.I get no pleasure from anything, I'm in constant physical pain, my mental health diagnoses are many and the abuse and trauma I've had inflicted on me has had life long affects, and honestly I'm just done, I've tried everything I can to 'fix myself' and now I spend my days hoping for a terminal illness or an accident that kills me so I can leave but spare others the trauma of losing someone to suicide.So I'm 'living' so I don't hurt / traumatise others but in doing so I'm continuing to hurt and traumatise myself.The majority of life I've put everyone's needs in front of my own, so they don't suffer the way I have, and a lot of times it has worked & they are doing better now, but no one puts me first, happy to use me when they need help, but not there when I need it. I am caring & empathetic, I don't want to change that about me, but it's hard when you give so much and nothing in return.So yeah, everything says suicide is wrong because of the effects on those left behind, but what about me? Maybe I should put myself first, existing to stop others from suffering isn't a reason to live.;My first attempt I was 15 years old, I'm in my 40s now and the ideations are always there, sometimes;;1;3;2024-04-19 13:53:13;2024-04-19;Friday;13:53:13;1915;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:50.710965

1c7x9ek;Tips?;Coalstripe;I, have been struggling more than usual for a while, more frequent behaviors I shouldn't engage in, the like. Something most of us are probably going through, in a general sense. I reached out to a relative. I'm not.. happy about it, but it was the safest option. She's thinking about getting me into the hospital. I've been a few times, whatever y'know? I have my doubts but I think it's worth one more shot. Thing is, I don't.. want to tell my dad. I'm an adult, I don't need to. But he's my dad. I still live with him (nearly 19 rn) and we used to be close. I feel obligated to let him know. But also, he enables me unintentionally a lot. When I was younger he took me out of the hospital earlier than advised. He was the one who got me home every time. He was there for me back then. Lately he's- more confrontational though.I can't bring myself to talk to him about anything. I didn't reach out to him. I don't know if I'm worried to disappoint him, hurt his feelings, or that he'll scold me for this. Last time he made me feel guilty as hell - I'm sure it wasn't on purpose but it doesn't change the impact it had. Is it fair for me to not tell him until after I've arrived, if I go with another relative? Would it be too harsh to suddenly tell him I don't want him visiting daily, maybe once or twice a week max (depending on the hospitals rules of course, this would be a new one)? I don't want to worry him or hurt him, but I'm not sure I can hold out long if I don't go.;I, have been struggling more than usual for a while, more frequent behaviors I shouldn't engage in, ;;0;1;2024-04-19 13:44:46;2024-04-19;Friday;13:44:46;1480;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:50.713356

I tried to ask these people who downvote if can tell me where I got it wrong, because I googled it to verify, and no one would answer. They just chose to keep on downvoting me.Then they even came onto my profile and downvoted the one post that I had made to vent to myself.I don't know man. My real life is shitty enough, and it's like I can't even go on reddit and talk about things that interest me without people egging on me, no matter how civilised I try to keep it.I asked life a few months back to show me how good or how bad it gets. I took my hands off the rails, I have no longer been trying to do anything. Because things have always been bad to the point I just don't have the will anymore to stay here on earth. So i told life, if Im not meant to live, just egg it on for me. And it seems it's doing exactly that.Idk, man. Some of us are really not meant to thrive in this world. It's born for those who are lucky. The rest of us are treated like meat meant for slaughter. Tell me how I am wrong, when majority of the people are so apathetical and selfish in this world.So yeah, goodbye everyone. Thanks for the good people that try. I have lost the fight. I give up.

1c7wuyz;I really think I'm going to do it soon;Burnerr1000;Every day that passes, suicide becomes more and more realistic and like the correct choice and I really want to do it. My gf broke up with me about 2 months ago. We broke up on good terms but have been doing no contact for about a month and a half. for about 2-3 weeks after we broke up we were still having sex but then I decided we should stop. We go to the same school and she has already started talking to someone knew. I'm mortified to be on campus because when I see her or them it gives me unbelievable anxiety. I coincidentally was walking behind them on my way to my car (trying to keep my distance) when someone called her to warn her I was behind her which really confused me and hurt. I then spoke up asked why that happened and she ignored me. I went off on her and her new man telling him all sorts of things like we were fucking for weeks after we broke up and that she's a cheater and she still had a love note i wrote her on her dashboard in her car (all true) just to make myself feel better and to try and sabotage her new relationship. I feel so worthless. So easily discarded and unvalued. I loved this girl with everything in me. I know i sound like a crazy person because of what I did but I genuinely believe I was a really good and extremely loving and compassionate boyfriend and all her friends thought the same. The pain I'm in is immeasurable. I skip almost all my classes now, I never stay on campus a second longer than I have to. I can't get her off my mind. The thought of another man's hands on her the same way mine were horrifies me. The idea of her inviting him over to sleep with her in the same bed that I slept with her in makes me want to scream. I see no way out. I still have feelings for a woman who made me feel like I'm nothing and not anything I do helps me feel better and 2 months later it feels just the same as it did the day she broke up with me.;Every day that passes, suicide becomes more and more realistic and like the correct choice and I rea;;0;2;2024-04-19 13:26:17;2024-04-19;Friday;13:26:17;1899;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:50.716802

1c7wr66;I feel like I'm not a real person.;Dull-Worry9942;"For many years now (10+) I've felt like I don't even really exist, or at the bare minimum I'm not really a person.I'm a prisoner physically and mentally to myself. I can't take care of myself at all, If it wasn't for the fact I live with my mother I'd be dead already. I almost never shower, I don't brush my teeth, my teeth are falling apart, my health is deteriorating mentally and physically. I think about suicide everyday, or at least getting terminally ill and dying so I don't have to disappoint anyone with my suicide. I feel like a background character in my own life. Like I'm there but add nothing and have no purpose or meaning.I don't enjoy doing anything anymore, I spend all my time on the computer playing games/other typical online stuff but its just to pass time or to be a distraction.I sit in my room alone for 16+ hours a day and sleep the rest, I don't have any friends, no one talks to me. I leave my house MAYBE 10 times a year on a good year, and that's typically only for emergencys where I don't have much of a choice. I hate myself and I hate my body, I had a tinder and after 5+ years the only 2 matches I had ever recieved are a prostitute and a bot. Not that I blame anyone, I'm fat and ugly, I have no job, no future, no dreams, no aspirations.I see all these happy and successful people online, or even that I grew up with/went to school with and I'm so incredibly jealous, because I know I will never be able to have any of that. My entire life is basically ""Can't because I'm depressed, depressed because I can't."" I've basically given up because I've lost so much time at this point and found so much comfort in just existing at a bare minimum that I can't change anything and honestly 99% of the time I have no interest in getting better.I'm just truly miserable and its getting harder and harder to handle.Everyday when my mom leaves for work, I have thoughts of putting an ""I'm sorry, and Thank you for everything.

1c7wdbl;Again and again;Valuable_Muscle8421;For over 20+ years I’ve been struggling against my suicidal thoughts, it doesn’t matter what I try and if I have happy moments, this is taking over me and I’ve never tried to attempt it because I’m also too scared of what’s next, I imagine coming back to live the same or worst and I just can’t.Men only showed me throughout my whole life that I’m no more than an object they use to fulfill their desires, someone they move around like a doll and when I speak about my feelings or desires or if I fight for them then they make me feel like a fucking demon. I hate men deep down, my father abused me sexually, psychologically, destroyed my self worth and love, demonstrated how he could be a demon to me and my family but faked to the rest of the world under a mask of a religious man. To this day I relive every moment and wish he would’ve just killed me the time he strangled me because “I wasn’t behaving”. My ptsd gets triggered when someone grab me or prevent me from moving, when they embrace me with no notice, I fight to defend myself and get mad so mad I’ve hurt them to protect myself, been in situations when I speak several times I don’t want to experience something to just get ignored, so I get upset super mad and have breakdowns. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong been to different psychologists but haven’t been diagnosed yet, cause I can’t keep showing up. Somehow I know no one will ever understand me or will have time to even try to listen to what I’ve been through.I know my anger manages me, when I’m not angry I feel numb or deeply sad. There’s always voices telling me stuff I don’t believe or want to hear, others remind me of my trauma, and others just tell me to hate whatever is going on in the present.I feel alone and like my will is to die alone by my own hand, I just can’t do this to my child;For over 20+ years I’ve been struggling against my suicidal thoughts, it doesn’t matter what I try a;;0;2;2024-04-19 13:03:25;2024-04-19;Friday;13:03:25;1825;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:50.723441

They don't think I'm trying hard enough. I'm trying to be excited about the interviews I have but it feels like they never go anywhere so why should I get my hopes up again? My sister is successful and living with her husband in another state, has been since she was my age and I'm a loser.My boyfriend and I just broke up and it's only supposed to be for a few months so we can both focus on other serious things but we're still friends at least. I feel like I keep saying the wrong things to him and hurting him though and it kills me. I love him so much and he's my best friend, I just want to be here for him in his rough times but I fuck it up because idk what he's comfortable with talking about. And I can't tell him how I'm feeling with the depression and wanting to die. We're planning to meet up for something we have planned in June but it feels so far away and part of me is scared he's gonna call it off.I'm going to the gynecologist today and I'm so fucking scared. It's the first time going and I made the appointment because I know something's wrong. My periods are bad physically and mentally, intimate stuff hurts, I just get random pains in my ovaries I guess. I'm not sure what I'm going to find out but everyone's downplaying my fears and I feel like I'm overreacting but I can't stop feeling scared.I just don't want to feel anymore and I kinda just want to die at this point because what am I doing? What do I really have to look forward to that doesn't feel a lifetime away? I know people would miss me too which makes me feel horrible but I feel like after a while they'd realize they're better off without me. My dad died and it seems like everyone forgot about him pretty quickly expect for me because I had to pull him off of fucking life support with a half a days notice that he was even in the hospital for a week. That incident alone tells me no one was thinking about me then and no one probably thinks about me now. I don't know if I have it in me to actually kill myself but I'm not being careful when I drive and I'm not really avoiding situations that could go bad anymore. I think if I were dying I'd be sad thinking about what I could be missing out on but happy I don't have to think about anything anymore.

Note is written out where I go into as much detail as to why I've decided to end it. The will is written out in regards to my personal possessions. The method has rehearsed and everything necessary functions properly. All that's left is getting rid of the last of my main reason for hesitating until now; empathy for others. Quite a few people care about me which should be great, but in the end, I get nothing from it anymore. I know it's a terrible thing to say, but I'm tired of living so others be alright. For too long I have put up with constant failure, frustration, sadness, guilt, anger, and loneliness. I have done all that is possible to try and improve things but I'm not strong or smart enough despite strong support. I'm a wounded animal in need of a mercy killing but others insist that things will be alright even though they clearly won't. It's maddening that they won't accept the reality of my situation, but at the same time, I don't blame them for trying to help me. It's been like this for years and I'm finally burned out. There is a twisted sense of resentment towards them that I know is selfish, cowardly, and cruel, but I'm tired of others benefitting from my existence where as I get nothing from it no matter how hard I try or how much pain I go through.I wish others would accept my decision to end my life but that is an unfortunately unobtainable wish. I like to think my mind is made up, but I fear the empathy will cause me to not go through with it which will just lead to more pain. I'm not completely sure as to when I will make my attempt, but it will likely be soon. So, if I finally grow a pai, manage to discard my thoughts of others, and finally take my last breath before returning to this page and any potential words of encouragement (as in vain as they may be), good bye and thank you.";Preparations are as much in place as I can.

1c7u2p4;I'm tired (long post);Frosty-Bluebird6042;I (24F) have spent my whole life working hard. I am tired. I spent all my school life working to get good grades and I was always a great performer.I skipped a class too because I was good. I have always been a thought child though. Always thinking, asking questions - which my parents didn't like. And I didn't always agree to something just because they said so. I was always the kid who wanted to know why.I come from a middle class family (Not USA or UK) Here middle class means we can eat comfortably. But we don't really do luxuries.I'm a first born daughter, so that has its effects.I did my undergrad in Architecture, it worsened or grew my anxiety , taught me a culture of overwork and self neglect and I realised the industry isn't too different from school and the pay isn't worth it. So I'm my 4th year I got the idea to transition to UIUX. Due to the limitations at home, it took me too long and I ended up finishing my bootcamp last year. I took a gap year from school to pursue the transition and did a lot of freelance projects and built up my skills. I have, however been unable to penetrate Upwork. I started applying for jobs this year, I'm in my final year of architecture school, I still live with my parents and have no stable source of income and this is the worst market for junior Product designers especially for remote roles. I've tried everything, including applying for free projects just to get a foot into the market. My parents are starting to put pressure on me to figure things out. They say I work too much and it's all pointless.It's a lot of pressure. Even on myself as I have been trying to move out to give myself a more supportive environment especially from my parents. They have constantly mocked me for all the work I've been doing. They resent me not wanting to pursue the degree I did as a career despite its clear effects on my mental and physical health. And my mom, who has her own problems with my dad, projects them on me constantly.I have a boyfriend. We've been together more than a year. He is aware of my extreme anxiety and mental health challenges and quite supportive. But I'm afraid it might be getting to much.Lately I've been having longer, more frequent anxiety attacks as well as bouts of depression. I managed to find a free therapy service for myself but it doesn't start until next week. I'm afraid it might be due to hormonal changes from an implant I've had the last for years and I'll get it removed just to see whether I'll be more emotionally stable.But I'm also aware I'm under a lot of pressure.With every attack I feel like I might not be meant for this life. I consider suicide more and more often. I wish I would die in various circumstances.I feel my life and my work has been a waste. My experience or efforts seem not to leave any room to make a living for me. I feel broken and like maybe I just don't know the secret to life or how to live. I'm starting to feel unfit for life more and more every day.I don't know what to do any more.;I (24F) have spent my whole life working hard. I am tired.

1c7tesd;I just wanted to be normal. That's it. I honestly give up.;Glad_Comfortable192;I have always wanted to be normal, always wanted to just be a part of the sea on unrecognizable faces, a part of the background, never standing out and never bothered. I’ve always thought that that is where true peace and happiness lies. That is where I will find my “Happily Ever After” that even an Ogre like Shrek got. I felt that was always  going to be just out of reach for me, if not for my religion, then it would be for my sexuality, if not for that, then for my gender identity, and if not for that, then it would for my list of mental illnesses that never seem to end. and  if not for that then it would ultimately  be for the color of my skin. Like I always say, life seems to give me the worst deck and expect me to land a winning play, with a 0% chance of it ever happening . I just think that this longing to be normal is not only a core part of who I am but a core part as to why I will never ( at least right now) be truly content, and I loathe that fact each and every fucking day of my miserable fucking existence. All I wanted is to be unremarkable, ordinary, hell, boring even and yet EVEN THAT is too much to fucking ask for.I admit it,  I am angry. I’m honestly fucking furious. All I’ve literally asked for my ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE  is to be normal and somehow, someway it has eluded me, and because of no fault of my own. For my childhood it was because I was a child of two Jehovah’s Witnesses that believed that if you even had so much as an “worldly”  thought that you would ruin the spirituality of the entire congregation. For my adolescence it was because my  two best friends thought it was okay to just take my entire innocence away by ramming their own genitalia down my anal cavity and calling  it a “game.” now for my young adulthood it’s because I not only got kicked out of the”church” that I grew up in, I also have come to realize that I might not even  like the body that I am in because of what it’s gone through and that I feel and innate NEED and desire to change not only how I look but who I am entirely to feel somewhat in control AND THAT IS  STILL NOT ENOUGH. Like I am genuinely losing my mind  right now at this moment and  I don’t know whether to run and  jump into oncoming traffic or run and jump off a bridge. But I know one thing’s for sure: I did not plan to live this long and quite frankly I'm running out of reasons to keep living. I’m  not even gonna sugar coat it after I said that I held my entire funeral in my head and even saw the reading  of my will too. and  since I’m  going to be nothing but honest I hope that  it goes exactly  like I imagined it. But if  im going tobe even more honest,I don’t  even know if i have the stomach to actually kill myself like if I did i most likely would   have done it by now  and  im still fuckin  here aren’t I? Un fucking fortunately Im still fucking here. My mom is right, I haven’t healed and quite frankly I don’t even know if this can be healed. I’ve had the same fucking thought since I was literally 6 years old in the first fucking grade that I want to be normal and my life has been everything but. and did I mention THAT NONE OF IT WAS  MY FUCKING FAULT. like I swear people think omg you  must've done SOMETHING. and quite literally besides be the fastest  sperm from my fathers dick juice and reach  my mom’s egg, NONE OF THIS IS MY FAULT. But i guess it is ultimately my fault, my fault I decided to be the little overachiever and want to actually be born. You know what’s really sick and I’ve never said this out loud, I wonder if the three still born babies that came before me knew that being my parent’s child would end up like this and decided to just die beforehand so they didn’t have to experience this shit hole of a life that was going to be handed to them and yet somehow even before I was fucking concivied that I was just as bull headed as my father and decided to be like no “Imma be different, I’m not going to get THAT life” and now look at me living THAT life and fully fucking regretting it. I honestly wish someone would just kill me so I wouldn’t have to have all this guilt for being alive. Like I really wish someone could just take me out of my misery and put me in the ground and just take the blame for me wanting to be dead. If it sounds like/ looks like I'm crying writing this, I’m not. My mind is literally clearer than it’s ever been before I can even hear my own voice say every single fucking word that I type out as I type it out even with spelling errors and all and I think that just goes to show how serious about this I am and quite honestly that’s really fucking scary. I just wish that either a) my entire life is a dream and when I die an expire that I wake  up and it was just a really bad vr route or b) I wake up and the world is fucking ending and I get to die all over again. Part of me wants to just post this  to my actual social media accounts and then put my phone on do not disturb  and then just either shoot myself or just jump off a bridge, haven’t decided quite yet. But one thing for sure, I don’t see myself surviving the year. I never saw myself going to high school and yet somehow I graduated, I wasn't supposed to see 15 much less turn 25 and yet here I am 23 turning 24 in 5 months and still wanting to die basically everyday and still trying to find someone to give me permission to finally just do it. Sad isn’t it. I honestly don’t know why I haven’t done it just yet or why I’ve gone through so much just to prove to myself over and over that everything would be so much better if I wasn’t even here. But here I am still fucking alive like I wish I wasn’t yet too scared of pain to even do something about it. That’s just pathetic. I could honestly go on and on and on but I guess end it here, because I feel as if I am just going to be typing and talking in circles. Let’s hope I’m dead soon cuz if not I don’t know what I’d be doing if I wasn’t. Good luck and let’s hope for the best, the worst or whatever. ps. anon account for obvious reasons;I have always wanted to be normal, always wanted to just be a part of the sea on unrecognizable face;;1;5;2024-04-19 10:22:30;2024-04-19;Friday;10:22:30;6027;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:51.892317

I have grown to not talk about me, not been able to talk to my friend as they always come to tell me their sad ass problems and i listen, but every time i try talking about something of minimal importance they interrupt me or simply dont listen, this have make me feel as they are an un safe place for telling them.Not long ago i had a pretty hard attack of depression or anxiety, i dont know but been with them wasn't comfortable anymore. At that time a friend that i used to like told me her problems as always and i listened as always, and as always i couldn't tell her anything about me not i had the opportunity and worst of all I didn't feel right to do it.

I'll also spend all the money I have to get some tasty food from restaurants 😋. Then, on the 12th of May, I'll walk to the Nile River, and jump in. No more discussion, no more argument, studying, work, I won't read again. Such thoughts fill me with serenity and comfortableness--the knowledge that I won't have to even think again!

All I want from the doctors is to know what's the next and best steps and do them.The terrifying part is that, even today, she's asymptomatic apart from the headaches (which have gone away when they gave her medication) but after two weeks of testing, it's confirmed that it's serious.Now we haven't lost hope yet, we're getting the best treatment options for her and the doctors have said it's beatable. So we're going to beat it together no matter what the cost.But I know I'm avoiding the stats and odds because I know that I cannot handle her dying so soon. For a bit of background, I grew up in a really abusive household and have carried a lot of trauma into adulthood. I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until my late 20s which made most of my life really challenging since I could never understand why I didn't function right. I've been in therapy for 2-3 years and have worked through most of my childhood trauma. What never changed is my fatigue with being alive. I've had little hope for my own future and little joy for what could come. Therapy helped, certainly, but life is tough and it's not getting better around us. She came into my life and I experienced safety, love, and miraculously happiness. It resuscitated me. I wanted to live and live long with her. For the first time in so so long, I was excited for my future with her together.And then the last two weeks happened and despite how much we're trying, I can't shake the looming anxiety that she's not going to make it. And I'll be honest, I'm not remotely ready for it. Her loss will break me. The day it happens, whenever it happens, I'll do the arrangements, support her family, do my best to sort everything out. And when it's all done, I'm going to kill myself.I'm expecting a lot of people will tell me I have a lot to live for but I'm going to stress that the last three decades on this planet have been largely ugly and horrible. I've been beaten, thrown out of home, betrayed by my sister who witnessed the abuse and didn't take my side when I finally confronted my mother. I've been fighting suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager and they've never really gone away, even with therapy. With therapy, it's dimmed to a small noise in the corner of my brain but it's never been silent.Anyway it's not silent anymore. The day she succumbs (if she succumbs, I still want to believe we can beat this), I have made my peace with having gotten the most out of this shitty horrible life. I grew as a person. I broke the cycle of abuse. I helped others as best as I could. I took care of my trauma (largely). I even proved to myself that I could quit cigarettes and be healthy. I brought my cholesterol down to a healthy green within normal range level. I proved to myself that with all of the effort I could put in, I could pull out a healthy happy life for myself from the shit and the suffering I've grown up with.Before she came into my life and integrated into it, I had made my peace with solitude. Have partners here and there but no permanence. No need for anything long-term. I was ready to just enjoy life as it came until I died and the suffering ended. She came in and blessed me with a life I literally thought was an impossibility for me. I wanted to wake up to her face, goof with her, raise cats with her until we were old and grey.I feel like that life has been stolen from me. Even though nothing major has happened, I can't shake the fact that we'll be there sooner than anyone could have planned for. If she goes, I'm done. There's no sense in living another 30 years with the pain I've grown up with and the devastation her death will wreak on me. I've had people I loved die before. This is different. This feels massive. I cannot carry this amount of pain and suffering on top of what I already have on my plate.I did what I wanted to from life. Saw what I wanted to. I got my dream career for the last 5 years after bumbling through careers that didn't make me happy. I resolved my feelings about my stolen childhood. I made peace with the abuse. I even accepted my abusive parents, knowing that they can't parent me twice so may as well just grieve the parenting I could have had. I have done enough, seriously, I am fine with everything I got from this life. With her by my side, I wanted to experience life with her no matter what we did, where we went. Perhaps in months, hopefully years, she is likely to die. I will leave as well. I'm not following her, I don't believe in any afterlife, I am simply refusing to do this longer than I can endure. Her cancer has denied her a lifetime. I wanted my life to go on with her. We have been denied a life together before it could really fully completely start. When the bulk of the procedures are done, we'll marry. And when the fateful day finally comes, I'll make plans for myself to die as well.;I'm 33 (m), 34 in August.

1c7skw5;I have a purpose and dream in my life, yet I still want to kill myself because I don't like the path laid out for me by my mom;oolteem8;"I'm warning you that this is gonna be a long-ass post.For context, I'm in a business degree so that I can do a corporate job in some bank. My entire life path has been laid out by my Mom. When I tell her my real passion (making stories), she shrugs it off and says ""you know what will really make you happy? If you made a lot of money!"" That's the gist of what happens when I bring up my stories to her.I guess it's true. If I'm not homeless, I'm happier right? If I had a job, a house, and I'm able to feed myself and buy luxuries, I'd be happy, right? I think a lot of people will fight to be in my situation, and I feel horrible for wanting to kill myself despite being here. The thing is, I just don't give half a flying fuck about my future. I hate it. I hate going to a desk job related to something I don't give a shit about for the rest of my life.My Mom even knows about my shitty mental health yet chooses to ignore it, pretending like I'm perfectly fine, which hurts a lot. In a moment of vulnerability, I asked her: ""Mom. I think I might have ADHD."" You know what she told me? ""I don't think you have ADHD. You're just fine."" and then after discussing this topic a few more times, she finally said ""ADHD isn't real"" and gave me a load of fake science to prove it. I never brought it up again. It was the same story when I told her I thought I was autistic. She said ""You're not autistic"" and never brought it up again. I tried therapy, and it seemed like she was uncomfortable with me going to therapy for some reason. It's like she wants to believe nothing's wrong with me, but clearly something is! Fortunately for her, therapy was mostly useless.After procrastinating on an essay that's due today, I realized I actually didn't want to do my degree. It's my tenth week here, and only now I realize I don't wanna do it. It's stupid. At first, I tried to be optimistic. ""Well, this will be exciting"". ""Look at all those interesting theories and concepts!"" At first, it worked. I was genuinely interested in all of those things, but there was a nagging part of me that screamed that it hated what I was doing - I suppressed it. I guess I've been suppressing it for too long. Right now, I am interested in what I'm learning, but at the same time, I don't care about it. I've procrastinated so much on my essay that I literally cried because I couldn't start. I feel nauseous just looking at the assignment brief. I realized deep down that I don't give a shit about my essay, and I'm not gonna do it. Each piece of work I previously did chipped away at the shield I've created in my mind, telling myself ""Wow, this subject is interesting. I genuinely want to learn more!"". And now, that shield is gone. This essay was the last straw. I don't give a rat's ass about my essay. I decided I'm just gonna watch the eSports game I wanna watch tonight. Fuck my essay. It's due today, but in reality it's more like I'm never gonna submit it, nor study for my upcoming exams. I'm so sick and tired of being anxious and stressed about random shit I don't care about. It's funny that I did well enough so even if I skipped this essay entirely, I'd still pass my subject.It's ironic that I'm suicidal. I literally have a purpose in life, and it's to bring joy to others. And yet here I am, wanting to kill myself, which ironically means I don't bring joy to myself.I have a dream of making an epic video game. I even made a 21-year plan to make my dream triple-A game, with details about how to partner with my dream publisher, how I'm gonna start my indie company to work on smaller games first, etc. I have most of the game mechanics down, the vibe of the world, the main character, the plot outline, and I'm even writing a book about the story to really flesh out the plot.But the path laid out for me (my degree and then getting a corporate job) is not related to that dream whatsoever. I tried to think that my business degree would help me run an indie-game company, but my mind doesn't give a shit. It doesn't see the link between my dream and my degree, and, to be frank, neither do I. I feel hopeless, even towards my dreams. When I look at my dream, I realize it's not even realistic. Partnering with a high-end publisher to make a triple-A video game? What the hell am I thinking? How is that a valid dream? There's no way I can accomplish it because of the sheer scale involved, let alone if I finish this degree and end up getting my stupid corporate job. I even told my mom about my plan to make this game. She kinda just shrugged it off and said something along the lines of ""Just do your degree. It'll make you happy.""I thought about fighting with my mom, but I have a super high fear of confrontation because of my dad, who kinda threatened my life when I was toddler (by hanging me off the balcony) because I wanted to sleep in my maid's room rather than with him and mom. Right now, though, he's chill after finding his new wife (my mom also has a new husband, if you're curious). In fact, my dad's more supportive towards my dreams and he was hesitant about me going to college (just like I was). This college thing is a complicated issue I don't wanna get into right now.I feel like, before killing myself, I'd just enjoy my life. Stress free. Fuck the path laid out for me. Fuck the stress and overwhelm I'm experiencing. I'm gonna travel to one country (since that's all I can afford) and enjoy myself there, maybe meet with the locals (I like getting to know people), look at the stars, see the sunrise and sunset, go on road trips with a cheap-ass car since I'm broke, and just chill in general. When I run out of money, I'd die. First, I'd find the tallest building and mountain. Then, I'd overdose on meds or drugs (I've never taken drugs before, though). While the substance takes effect, I'll slit my wrists right before off. If I somehow survive that three-pronged suicide attempt... I don't know what to say.There's something in my life I experienced relating to this. One day last year, I decided I was overwhelmed with school. I said ""Fuck it, I'm gonna kill myself today. Today's the day"". As a form of a last hurrah, I did things that I enjoyed. I rode buses to random places, since I loved riding buses. I walked around places to explore them. I ate in my favorite restaurant. I interacted with a bunch of people. Suddenly, a thought came into my mind. I told myself ""If you can walk home, you will not die today."" I gained a sense of extreme resolve and determination I've never felt before. It was like those movies where people do a ""Last Stand"" and somehow survive, or that part in Avengers: Endgame where Captain America had the resolve to fight Thanos' army alone. I felt that on that day. I walked under the hot sun, in rain, with my legs hurting, and I made it home. The train systems didn't tempt me. The taxis didn't tempt me. I walked all the way home, which was kinda far away form the starting point. The funny part is that experience didn't change me at all. I'm still suicidal now.I don't think anyone's gonna read the whole thing, but if you did read it from start to finish, I'm glad you did. Thank you for being a good person and trying to help. Thank you for carrying out my purpose in life (bringing joy) for me, since I can't do it right now.TL;DR: I'm on a path in my life I don't wanna be in, and I see the path I do want to be in as impossible to accomplish. I'm planning on just dying but I want to enjoy myself first.";I'm warning you that this is gonna be a long-ass post.For context, I'm in a business degree so that ;;1;3;2024-04-19 09:27:39;2024-04-19;Friday;09:27:39;7476;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:51.903170

1c7shms;I’m so sad ;Single_Marsupial7399;I’ve always seen beauty in life. Despite having a somewhat difficult childhood (nothing extreme, but not ideal), growing up morbidly obese and gay, having massive insecurities, I always had joy and excitement. A desire to build a worthy and ‘normal’ life, to better myself.This all was going well. Last year I got onto a doctorate course I’ve worked my life for. I was in a relationship, had a home, a puppy. But then found out my partner cheated on me, he was a covert narcissist and became so cold. I was destroyed for a bit, but the light and joy came back on. I was excited for finishing my course, maybe then finally having a pretty good income… dreams of moving to a city, buying an apartment or something, even if I was single. I’d never felt comfort in being single.But then all hell broke loose. I stopped taking antidepressants following my GPs uneducated tapering advice. I experienced horrible withdrawals but didn’t realise this at the time. I also took a supplement which I believe caused me an awful syndrome caused post finasteride syndrome (PFS).Not knowing about PFS initially, I reinstated my antidepressant. Not knowing this could make PFS worse… what followed is a nightmare, body pains, brain fog, complete sexual dysfunction and numb genitals, fatigue, depersonalisation, anhedonia, aged and loose skin.I tried to stop the reinstated antidepressant and faced awful withdrawal symptoms… night terrors, paraesthesia, akaesthesia, complete and utter feelings of dread and shame. I reinstated and the numb anhedonia returned, which is easier to endure. The mad part is I’m on 0.4mg following advice of a forum, how can doctors be so uneducated about this? So I’m stuck, stop the antidepressant and risk the absolute hell that can bring for years, or continue and face worsening physical deterioration.Either way, it doesn’t much matter. The physical changes I’ve experienced are likely permanent, as well as the anhedonia. I’m very unlikely to ever find a partner with my physical difficulties, I look like I’ve aged 10 years and have basically been castrated. It’s a bad situation when the reassurance I give myself over having deformed, numb, non-functional genitals is “what does it matter… with the anhedonia I can’t feel love anyway”.I had so much in my grasp, and it’s all been taken from me by medication. I’m done being angry, because here I am. I feel like I’m failing because I’m not getting ‘better’ or trying hard enough. I haven’t been able to work since new year. The worse part is it’s all invisible from the outside, and I just look “depressed”.This just isn’t me anymore, I’m gone. I’ve turned into someone I don’t recognise in the mirror, physically and emotionally. The grief I feel is almost too much to bare.;I’ve always seen beauty in life.

1c7sg44;Becoming a worse person.;Snake_Hail72;I'm tired of writing paragraphs that never get read. I feel as though I've been mistreated a lot in my life. I hate saying that because I feel like such a victim. I'm distant from people and don't want to get close. But I'm so lonely. I assume the worst and that people are going to hurt me in some way. I'm no longer the sweet girl who everyone walks over. Instead I'm bold and distant and it crosses into just being mean. I of course never have wanted this. I hate myself more and more everyday when I see myself changing. I could never actually get myself to become so distant from people before. I would cling to them or try to do everything to keep them around. But now I feel as though I could walk away from the people around me and never come back and live on my own (I would miss them of course. But I would feel much more safe if I was on my own). I can never do good things. I always mess them up. Even after all this therapy. After all this healing. I thought I would be a better person for myself, and for others. I still fuck up and I hate myself for it. I feel so disconnected from others. I feel like men only want me for my body, and nothing more. I'm tired of self reflecting and trying to better myself. I feel so confused and tired because I think I'm doing something right but I end up getting it wrong. I know I need to reflect to be a better person but I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of staying awake at night about it all. Especially when no one cares about what they've done to me. I feel like I need to just kill myself because I can't get it right and I feel like no one will ever love me, and even if someone did, I wouldn't deserve it.;I'm tired of writing paragraphs that never get read.

1c7sb5e;Need some help for better active listening to support a suicidal friend;Future_Sprinkles121;"I made a post yesterday asking for tips on supporting my suicidal best friend, whom I also live with. She has hardly any other support network other than me, few (if any) internal resources, and the worst part is a lot of her issues come from comparing herself to others, especially me, so when things go right for me but wrong for her it feels like my presence directly makes things worse by giving her someone to compare herself to.However, as I'm still the closest person she has, and living together means I'm always around, I'm also the one person she can talk to, so I try to be there for her as much as possible. It's difficult because comparing herself to me means that me just being there makes things harder. In my post yesterday I said I struggle with active listening because I find myself getting defensive, or, because she'll often say things like ""how do you do it"" and I catch myself answering or saying what I'd do in her situation, which is basically the same as giving advice and is obviously not helpful. I've tried to direct her to help lines and therapy, but she refuses because she sees no point.But a comment pointed out that I can ask why she sees no point and that made me realise...She's already told me why. We talk about this stuff pretty much every day. She's talked about it so much, I know almost all the answers to most clarifying questions I could ask in the context of her venting. I'm scared to ask things such as ""why"", because over the course of time she's already told me why (even if not in direct response to me asking). It feels like that will come across less as active listening and more like not listening, or not paying attention to what she's saying. What can I do? How can I keep showing her that I am listening and that I do care? The scariest part is that I would also feel hopeless in her situation. I understand her. But I can't just say that, because I feel like that would affirm her feelings of futility and her thoughts of suicide. Is there a better way to express that understanding without sounding like I'm agreeing with or supporting her ideation?Lastly, I know it's part of active listening to repeat what someone's just said to you in order to affirm it, but I don't know if that's helpful. I've called hotlines myself when I was passively suicidal and always found myself frustrated when I had to listen to them repeat exactly what I just said - I know it's part of their training so I appreciate the effort, but it feels very much like they're just mechanically following the guidebook on what to say. Ask questions, repeat things back, etc. It actually felt quite impersonal. It feels like such a fine line - I don't want to have that effect on her, I don't want to sound like I'm just robotically saying all the ""correct"" things, especially not as her close friend. How can I avoid this?Sorry for the long post, and thank you in advance for any advice.";I made a post yesterday asking for tips on supporting my suicidal best friend, whom I also live with;;0;3;2024-04-19 09:08:42;2024-04-19;Friday;09:08:42;2918;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:51.909632

1c7s241;Just got done cutting myself. I wish it didn’t make me feel better, but it does. ;AltForSadEnbyHours;I consider myself an extremely logical person, almost to a fault, and I can’t explain it. Life is just too much sometimes.I have no money, like. Not exaggerating, literally nothing. I couldn’t get a damn happy meal if I wanted to. I can’t work until I get my heath sorted and gods only know when that’ll be. If ever. Dating is miserable. I find one person I’m super excited about but then things start to progress and all of a sudden I don’t want them anymore for one reason or another. I have four people right now who I know for a fact would date me if I let them but I get in my own head and so far hung up on details like… this one’s face isn’t the exact shape I like, or this one is a little farther away than I’d like, or this one may not have a body type I’m into. Even someone who seems perfect, I’ll find a way to talk myself out of it and my impulse is just to push them away and not even give it a second thought even though I know they could make me happy if I… wanted them to. My peers are all leagues ahead of me. I went to a pretty damned good school. My best friend is now working a fancy state engineering job. Now another of our close friends who was always ‘the slacker’, ‘the stoner’, ‘the one who wasn’t going anywhere’ just had a $65,000 salary dropped on their lap. And then there’s me. Damn good grades while I was in school. Too poor and in too rough a place to go back and finish what I started. Years behind those two. Yeah I know, comparing yourself to others is bound to lead to despair. I can’t help it. I could’ve been one of those two. I could’ve been either of them or better and I was fucked over by genetics and poor circumstance. So. All of that on my mind at 3 AM, and I decide, fuck it. If I can’t die, I might as well wish I was and cut the shit out of myself. I’ve done it a few times now. I never thought in a million years it would make me feel better at first. But it does. Watching the blood drip from my thighs and feeling the sharp, burning pain. It feels right. It feels like what I deserve. It feels like penance for some transgression I’m not even sure I committed. I feel like I’ve atoned for… being the fuck up that I am. Of course, I only feel like that for now because I still feel the pain. Once that fades, once the wounds heal and fade.

He strongly suspected I have BPD and prescribed me  Abilify on top of my antidepressants. It doesn't seem to help for now. Reading up on the symptoms, I do relate to most of it besides the anger outburst. I don't get just sad, I feel profound grief when anything bad happens. I get so depressed it hurts physically, I'm in so much pain and can't handle it anymore.My self esteem is at its lowest ever. I've also read a lot of bad things people say about BPD, and it made me feel even worse about myself. Some people seem to think anyone with BPD is a monster. I'm already dealing with tons of guilt and shame, I lost my only friends due to my binge drinking and stupid behavior. I don't mean to hurt people, but I still do. I think it would be better if I killed myself soon so I avoid hurting anyone else accidentally. I already have a plan.Since BPD isn't really treatable, I also feel like I'm going to be in pain forever. I've already been depressed for 7 years now. I also deal with alcoholism, an eating disorder, terrible anxiety and dissociation. I've been sexually abused by 3 different person I trusted, people I thought were my friends.

I had a really rough childhood growing up, drinking father who beat my mom, 0 supportive relatives, I struggled with extreme hypochondria, I was in a house fire, I was introverted -after my teenage years I lost a 5 year relationship with a caring person, and my mother always requested more of me. I was never enough, there was always something missing, nobody seemed to be proud of me. Despite everything, I somehow tried to grow up positive, I studied, I had hobbies and at times life seemed good. Where I am in life now seems like a perfect place for most people, I play in a band, I have my own place to live, I work a job that sustains me and I dont despise. Issue is, despite everything, I am depressed. I dont have any supportive family members, only a mother and a brother that dont care one bit. Thing is, what sparked joy in my life was my most recent relationship. However, a lot happened and my mom forcefully pushed that person away, as she basically just didnt like her. Thats all, no arguments, nothing, just like that. So I was left alone once again.I think a lot about life, and I feel like now that im 24 and living in ""normal"" circumstances, I dont imagine anything getting better, but it can definitely get worse. Even living out my childhood dream of being a musician is not enough. Whatever I do I will never be enough, even though I have done what I think is enough for me, but nothing seems okay, nothing is in the right place. The only thing left for me is to decide how I want to do it. I wanted to share this as I do not want to burden anyone else with my story. All my life I have complained to people regarding my situation. Nobody believes I am unhappy, nobody understands how I feel as financial stability seems like a lot of people's definition of a happy life.

1c7p9oy;Ready to go;NoSuccotash3701;"I'm almost 42 and have nothing to show for the last 30 years of fighting depression. My ""career"" is a rape joke (in that it is a joke, but it's not funny), I have few friends, no partner; I've never had the same job, or dated the same person, for two consecutive years, and that is not by choice, everyone just throws me away. I don't expect anyone to care about me, beyond the superficial, because I am no more important than an empty beer can; only worth collecting if you're desperate enough to be collecting empty cans to recycle. I never particularly wanted kids, but I resent how it was never really an option, for me. (I got my mother to stop sweating me for grandchildren by pointing out that, if that did happen, it wouldn't be like ""yay, my wife and I are having a baby, which we totally want and can afford!"" It would be like ""...shit, I got this girl pregnant and she's waffling about aborting..."" Unless their mother made a LOT more money than I ever have, or they were subsidized by their grandparents, my kid(s) would have grown up in grinding, inescapable, gap-toothed, hand-to-mouth, 'the smelly kid in class' poverty.) Now I consider it an act of protest: I will not help spawn the next generation of proletariat to fight over shitty jobs.I acknowledge that I am a product of a privileged background, and that's just salt in the wound: I have had almost every possible advantage in life and still amounted to jack shit. I'm privileged enough that I'd have to fuck up pretty badly to end up homeless, but not enough to just coast into some cushy job I'm not qualified for. And I am smart, I have spent a considerable amount of time, effort, and my own money on upskilling and trying to advance, but I didn't make ALL the right choices in my teens and 20s, so apparently I'm a fucking moron only fit for menial labor.I'm not as suicidal as some of y'all. I have a gun right here, I could end it all right now, but I'm too stubborn / chickenshit / spiteful. I often think, if the people who say they love me really did, they would let me go. Check me into a hospital, say their goodbyes, and let me drift off into opiate-induced oblivion. I often feel like I'm drowning, and everyone is just standing around agreeing that it's awful, and wishing me luck, but not actually doing a single goddamn thing about it.So I usually go about my life with a certain indifference. I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of the pain and suffering that usually goes with it. And I am relatively poor in an expensive area, so I'm surrounded by soft yuppie bourgeoisie filth I would chew up and spit out if they didn't have cops protecting them. I'm that wiry, dead-eyed delivery guy who would punch you out, if not stab you, if you came at him the wrong way.

1c7p77m;I am so burnt out.. I need a break;Multipersonalitygirl;I (19f) am a college freshman. Everything is paid for with scholarships and grants, and I even get about $2000-$3000 back a semester because of excess funds. I am enrolled in the honors program at my college and joined an honor society. I graduated from high school as a valedictorian and was the first in my family to graduate and attend college. All of this is great, except, I am burnt out from everything. I work a part-time job after class, about 30 hours a week. I have worked through all my breaks from school with only 2-3 days off. For winter break, I had 3 whole weeks off from school and only 3 days off from work because it was just me and my manager. We were short-staffed. During spring break, I had 2 days off. The transition from the fall semester to the spring semester has been very rough. I have been sleeping through class most days or skipping class. I think it is important to say that I commute to school. I live 10 minutes away from my college and I hate sharing rooms so dorms were not something I wanted to experience. I have been turning in most of my assignments late and getting bad grades. I am on probation for the honors program for my school because my gpa is lower than what is required. All I want to do is sleep and do nothing at all. I lost all motivation for everything. I have no social life either. I am extremely introverted and will not speak to anyone unless they speak to me first. I only have my boyfriend, who has been nothing but supportive. I feel like I miss out on so much in college because I don’t have friends or live on campus. I have made a plan for how I would end my life. I told my boyfriend my plan and it made him cry. Today I could not focus nor concentrate on my month-late essays, and I cried because I feel like a failure. I want to drop out. I am exhausted. I went to my boyfriend’s house to cry with him, and I am considering ending things. I struggle with reoccurring depression and general anxiety disorder, so this is not something I am unfamiliar with. I have attempted suicide in the past and committed self-harm. I usually fake it until I make it, and I am planning on doing that until my plan is fulfilled. I earned another scholarship today but I haven’t told anyone. I don’t feel like anyone would care enough. I am struggling so hard to find the motivation to keep pushing. My boyfriend keeps telling me that summer is almost here. Next week is dead week for me, then the week after that is finals. He tells me that I can rest as much as I’d like this summer, then I can go into the fall semester with a clear mind. However, I feel like my brain has made it clear to my heart that I will not be here by next Christmas. I don’t know who to talk to. I haven’t gone to counseling in about year, and I don’t want to start again. I don’t have any friends to vent to, and my boyfriend already deals with enough. Besides, I don’t want to see him cry again. The first time I saw him cry was one month ago, when I told him my suicide plan. He doesn’t want to lose me. I am losing myself. I am tired.

1c7nodb;I failed tonight;LonelyMouse21;I tried to end it all just a few hours ago. I got everything ready and made the attempt but I was in too much pain from my chronic pain to continue. I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried every drug under the sun (even experimental stuff), I've tried different therapists, I've been hospitalized 5 times, but nothing helps. I don't want to be here anymore but I'm literally in too much pain to punch my own ticket. This existence is hellish and I want out. My life has been a menagerie of pain, neglect, and abuse and I don't see any end in sight. I didn't everything that they said would help me feel better, and I'm arguably worse off than when I started. At least before therapy I wasn't nearly as aware of how absolutely messed up my life and relationships have been. I'm at the end of my rope and I just want to know what I'm supposed to do now.;I tried to end it all just a few hours ago.

1c7no26;Killing myself after I graduate;ConsistentCaps;I'm graduating may 5th, but there is nothing to look forward to after I finish. My parents don't give a shit about me, I have no family in the city I'm in, I'm living paycheck to paycheck, starving, and a burden to everyone around me. I only ever wanted a home, but now that is no longer a reality now that rent is alarmingly high.It seems that no matter what I do, there is no escaping my situation. I get so mad there's people out there who live in mansions, have billions of dollars and hoard all the money, but I have to live in my car with no success. So many people are suffering. It just seems like life is not worth living. There is no point in trying anymore because collectively we just accepted this bare minimum in society and it seems like its a hole we can never get out of... people are scared to protest, take action, and fight for change.. I try to fight against this system, but there is no hope in hell for a better future with the state of the world. My parents had me when they were 15, now I'm a 24 year old adult with no support, no money, and no where to turn. I wish I was aborted. Why would people have a child just to leave them for the world to mangle. Now here I am making the decision to end everything. I wish I was never born. There is nothing but debt and emptiness in my life. I'm only getting my degree because this is something that I am doing for me and to say that at least I tried and did it.;I'm graduating may 5th, but there is nothing to look forward to after I finish.

Tomorrow I have a therapy appointment with a new provider and I am contemplating telling my state of mind but I probably will not.

I tried partial suspension hanging - meaning my feet, bum, or knees were always on the ground. I went to the hospital, and they did no scans and said I was okay. I also went to my GP who ordered a carotid artery ultrasound and that came back perfect. Does this mean I escaped any long term neck or brain damage?Or do I need to get an MRI or other tests?As all I can think about is that I’ll have to suffer the pain of this terrible mistake for life.

1c7nepu;I got lucky;ResidentTackle7303;I am a person with three college degrees a year long program for cyber security certification, I have years of an experience as a senior developer and I been looking for a job since feb 13 thru indeed. I kept getting interviews making itTo the 3 -5 round only to head dead air . I wanted to end my life after two months 64 days to be exact if not being able to find a job. This last interview I prayed every day that this company would give me a chance they do AI and drone stuff and I’d be a LAMP senior dev. In the technicalInterview I absolutely nailed it intl they started asking questions I didn’t prepare for. I thought this was just another farce and was drinking liquor 3-5 times a week black out drunk every time. I wanted to die, I stopped caring. Luckily I’ve been renting rooms so that way I had enough money to sjrvice for at least a year or 2 without finding work. I finally got a 150k job. Literally prayed everyday and toldMyself I am going to make better decisions if I get this job. And I got it. I used to be a cocky bastard automatically assuming I should get the job cause I got the qualifications. I ate the biggest piece of humble pie you can possibly eat. Not sure idYou can see my previous posts butHoly fuck I was down. And I was without a job for 63 days. I got so fuckin lucky and it’s amazing how quick one’s mind can change if they are give a chance. The very first thing I thought of was this Reddit post. I’m reading stories of people likeMe who haven’t gotten a job In 6–mo to 2 tears I never knew how this feels felt until recently. It’s so messed up and makes one look at life pessimistically. I feel for the people on this channel. After over two months my optimism to work hard and live is back. I still can’t fucking believe it. The amount of Liquour I was drinking was horrible cause I stoped caring. Im curious to hear other persons stories compared to mine. ESPECIALLY if it’s been longer than two months l. I got a 150k job. I prayed every day before every interview and after it. And I would have obsessed hindsight memories on how I thought the interview went word for word. I seriously feel for this channel cause I was that cocky bastard telling my self people that was to die are cowards and not trying hard enough. You best believe that humble pie I at changedMy mind. I don’t ever want to feelThis way ever again. I wouldWorkout everyday after work since Im productive and strife under a structure. My heart goes out to all the people whoSimply want to die because of the fact they can’t find a job. I can’t tellYou all how much I prayed before and after every interview cause that was all I fucking had. It’s insane to me how horrible this feeling can be. If anyone for a story like mine I’d loveTo hear it. Especially if you’re an engineer of some sort or a software developer. My mind changed from not giving a fuck it I live or die to again having optimism and hopeForTheFuture. I can’t stand when people sayOh it will get better you gotTo be patient. For some people it seriously doesn’t happen. I never thoughtI’d post of this channel but I never want to feel this way ever again. I was onlyDrinking bed cause I felt hopeless and when I’m working I don’t drink at all. Plus I was spending my money I saved like I wasStill making 200k a year. Now that I know what this feels like, holyShitMy heart goes out to these people. It’s just mind lowing that all a person needs is an opportunity for a decent job or one that they want to get.

About a month ago I was raped, all I wanted was him, my boyfriend, but when I tried to talk to him about it, he shut me down. We kept bickering for about a full 4 hours before we called it quits. I remembered all the times I hurt other people in my life and I grabbed my knife off of my knife stand until I remembered my 3 best friends. My best friend in the whole world said ""when me and my girlfriend get married, I want you to dress up like a dude and be the best man at my wedding"" I started sobbing and I threw the knife away from me.

1c7mwym;It is getting worse by the day ;Buruh_momentum;Well first of all, hello. I am a 20 (soon turning 21)years old male for clarification. I am sorry in advance for my terrible english skills, it is my second language and i haven't been able to practice it a lot.For the last five years of my life, i have been getting worse physically and mentally. Due to having dropped out of school multiple times, i have spent two of those years laying in my bed and occasionally moving out of my bed to eat or drink something (i am living with my mother.). Because of this, my body have gotten significantly better.During the last year, i have tried to get into a job with some special formation which my country provides, thanks to it i have been able to get into another formation which, if i were to complete it, would grant me the diploma necessary to be a secretary (which was my only solution at the time due to my physical condition), the problem is that i fucked it up due to me not being able to handle something that i don't feel fulfilling.After i've given up, i have tried starting the gym but the problem with that is that i don't got the money to continue. I also do not have access to any financial help due to my mother working in another country, her work alone is barely enough to take care of me and my mentally struggling sister. my country also does not offer healthcare if you don't got insurance covering it or else you gotta pay and i will be judged regardless by my whole family if i dared tried getting better on my own, hence why i decided to gatekeep everything for myself, the problem is that i have reached the point of not wanting to try anymore, the façade is getting harder by the day to keep. There was a time where i felt like i had complete control of my emotions and my thinking, almost like i was experimenting my body from a third person perspective.During those five years, i have excessively drank although i do not feel like i am addicted as i do not crave the need to drink, even though i haven't tasted any alcohol in a month but this and my excessive insomnia definitely killed my psyche. I have always had problems with speaking properly, mostly due to my brain thinking faster than my mouth could talk but now they are definitely getting worse, i cannot relax and focus at all anymore, i have tried and always failed. My vision and hearing have gotten worse, i cannot see well and i can't even hear properly even if somebody is talking close to me. My body feels in pain somewhere constantly, i also forget a lot and i see movement from the corner of my eye when i reach corners.I know this feels like a manic episode but strangely i feel like i'm thinking quite clearly. All this to say that those episodes happen frequently everytime i hit rock bottom and hold on like that for a big period of time. Frankly, i feel like i have felt... Empty for a while now, just empty and husk but strangely angry at life like i don't want to do anything anymore. I do not hope for anything as i know i cannot reach the top of the world anymore, i know this might sound strangely megalomaniac but i feel like i'm just a nobody among nobodies and it deeply saddens me. If i were to live i woule have to live for somebody else but this means that i would not have freedom and control over my own life. If i were to try to live like i want, they would just put me in Asylum for me to rot away. Since i cannot live like i want to, i want to at least experience what i wish to experience and end myself like i want to. I want to die with a smile, i want don't want people to cry at my funeral, i want my casket to lower down while my friends opens up a bottle of rum and sing along to the tune of Binks No Sake. I want to reach whatever paradise or hell that awaits me and say to the lord that i do not have regrets, although i know i will keep my burden up there, but at least i know that i will feel lighter. Maybe i would wish to write about myself, i wish for people to go to the library, see my book and wonder who i were. Maybe my story will change someone else, this is what would make me smile to the face of death. May people be annoyed, happy, disappointed or sad at my fate, i want them to go to me as they die and talk to me. Maybe my anger will be dissipated that way and if my death is insignificant then it's fine too, as i myself will know about what kind of man i were, what kind of men i wished to be. My suicide letter will have my final regrets in it, addressed to the people for which i did not have the courage to tell what i could tell. They will surely be sad but it's fine. Nothing can be as ideal as i imagine it to be. Until then, i will rot away in my bedroom, to cry about my misfortune, to think about jumping from my window every night but i just know that i will only decide when it is time when i will decide it and it will surely be this year and i know nobody will be there to stop me because i will go alone.;Well first of all, hello.

1c7mha1;I just want to sleep and never wake up;Weak-Tie4626;I have had a chronic illness since I was 13. Seizures, temporarily paralysis, and tics have taken over my teen years. I’m 18 and I’m just starting to live life and I was so excited to start college but my health became so bad not even 3 weeks into the semester. I had to drop out. My body is in constant pain. When I go to work I don’t even feel like a human being, just a robot who works those few short hours just to go home again and do nothing but exist. I hate my body both inside and out. I hate that my body doesn’t work properly but my arms and stomach and thighs are just so fat. I cut my stomach just because I wish I could chop it off and get rid of it. I only eat one small meal a day and I puke it up by the end of the day. I feel like I can’t connect to my friends or the new boy I’m dating. I feel like they all hate me or I’m an outsider looking in. I don’t feel real happiness but I have pets that I love so much and I take care of them and tell them I love them so much. If I leave they will be so confused. And I’ve been close to killing myself before when I was 16 but when I got help all my mom did was scream at me for being selfish. I just didn’t want to live with this physical pain but now it’s even worse because the physical pain and mental match. And I can’t get a therapist because when I had one my parents bitched about how much it cost all of the time and I can’t afford to pay for one myself. I have no one to talk to. I wish I had killed myself when I was 16. I wish I could go to sleep and just never wake up. I don’t think I’ll live to become 20.

1c7mb3f;I'm getting kicked out of 18, I don't have a phone, car, job, and I have 0$ to my name. What do I do?;Hour_Present_1715;-I don't see any rules saying on restricted topics, I wanna tell everyone all of the details to fully give ppl a view what is happening, so i apologize for the trauma dumping, this is an legitimate request for advice-I didn't want to post on r/FinancialAdvice or r/Advice becuase of self harm stuff, but it is a request for help.  For the past year I've been in and out of hospitals, rehabs and mental health facilities, I blame myself for why I was there, but all of my reasons why I acted out was due to something did or said that fucked with my confidence, maybe i overreacted. every time I was discharged from a hospital or facility, My parents did something that made me act out (opening the door and telling me to leave, breaking phones, laptop, fuck with me and make fun of how I act, constant room searching, watching me walk home from school, and following my friends home in their car, daily arguments and fights between mother & father made me fucking crazy) And then I would self-harm and go back to the hospital. I was in this loop for about a year. I broke out of the 'loop' by avoiding my parents, getting lost in schoolwork, and isolating myself when they start to get on my nerves. I don't have a phone, used to have one. I had a couple jobs, but I never could keep one long-term because I was always sent out of home, so no paychecks I was able to collect, and I don't have a bank account. I DO have a driver's license, citizenship and social security. Before the loop and before I was ever in the troubled teen industry, I lived at my ex house, and when that ended, is when the loop started. I had an argument earlier today, and found out I'm gonna be without a home soon. I wanted to turn back to self harm, which is a daily thought atp. I don't think I can be in any thing military related, I'm prescribed psychiatric meds. Every day I wake up and know I might die or go back to the hospital because my confidence is so low. How do i go about this without withdrawing from school, or becoming homeless. There's nobody I can crash with, and I don't have a therapist (I can't pay for one, which is why I'm on here).;-I don't see any rules saying on restricted topics, I wanna tell everyone all of the details to full;;3;1;2024-04-19 02:54:58;2024-04-19;Friday;02:54:58;2134;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:53.085307
1c7maty;Nothing to show for my life;bigLosocuzyouknowso;Its been awhile since my thoughts brought me down this road but here we are again. I'm 29m, im supposed to be turning 30 in September. I have nothing to show for my life. No achievements, literally nothing.  I have no skills, no job, no car, no kids, no gf, no nothing. I live in my parents basement. I worked construction with my dad for years,but I never learned any skills from it. Just how to carry heavy things. I never went to college after highschool cause I knew school wasn't for me. As for the no gf,  maybe I'm not attractive enough since im on the heavy side or maybe girls see I have no potential, no ambition. Since I was in middle school I was always made to feel like I don't do anything in my family, that im useless, but if I say anything now, no one cares. No one wants to acknowledge anything they've done wrong so I feel like there's no point in talking to anyone about it. I never planned living past 21 but here I am. I'm stuck with a life that I don't know how to fix. I don't know if I even want to fix it. I feel like such a failure to my parents as their son. They used to compare me to everyone else's kids say the amazing things that they've done. I haven't been able to even give them something to brag to people about and show that they're proud of me. I feel like a failure as a man too. I'm supposed to be able to put my feelings aside and get after what I want, to show ambition, to show hunger for success but I don't. I'm told I'm loved, but I don't feel it. People say you have to love yourself 1st to be able to accept others love for you, but how? How can I love myself when I don't have anything. I constantly feel worthless and useless. I don't feel deserving of love if i have nothing to offer anyone. I've even come to terms that If I stayed living into old age, I'll more than likely die without ever having married. Everyday feels like I'm getting closer to the end of the line. Im getting tired of battling these thoughts all the time. They feel so welcoming. Like I'll find peace on the other side. I just don't know what to do anymore.;Its been awhile since my thoughts brought me down this road but here we are again.

1c7ltra;Need advice;kait2023;Hi. I'm not sure how else to start this off. I'm 18 years old and I've recently been having extremely bad mental health episodes. I've been struggling with mental health ever since I was 13 but it's never really been this bad. It's gotten to the point where I'm debating admitting myself to the psych ward. I've been going over the list of pros and cons to going but I have a lot of stuff I'm concerned about. Part of the issues with my mental health are extreme mood swings, sensory issues (mostly food) and just overall bad thoughts about myself. I have the issue of not being able to talk about what I'm going through with strangers unless I feel safe so I'm not sure if that would affect anything. Another thing I'm concerned with is I need safe foods in order to eat. I know that in the psych ward, not eating is a red flag but would they force a feeding tube if there are no safe foods? I also can't sleep or function without sound that I can control. I'm just worried that those main things would make my experience really bad. I'm just looking for advice and if anyone has gone through something similar. Thanks in advance.;Hi. I'm not sure how else to start this off.

1c7lkq8;i'm alone;Dry_Appearance8497;I have a very hard time creating relationships in my life, to no fault of my own (?). I truly love everyone I have let into my life, but I have this habit of not forgiving them for any mistake no matter how small. This is because I would rather leave and have someone I love hate me, than stay and hate someone I love. I say that I'm not at fault because I would never even think of doing the things they did to me, again, no matter how small. However, this has created this general hatred of people against me. A lot of people in my college hate me because they have heard things about me, and by that I mean the fact that I ghost people without telling them what they did wrong, because 1. I am terrified of confrontation, 2. I am 100% sure that all the people I've ghosted before knew exactly why I did but played dumb because it would benefit them, 3. I have no one to tell my side of the story to while they always have so many people around. I understand that ghosting is bad, but I honestly cant stand the thought of acting any other way because I don't want to be seen as a victim in any situation. I see everyone be friends with everyone, while I feel like even my own friends hate me, although I have always been very careful to not hurt anyone in my life, the only thing they can use as an argument is the fact that I left with no explanation and it always seems to work because I am alone and they're not. It doesn't help that my best friend still hangs out with a man I am still in love with but who only wanted to use me, and then I ghosted him after I found out his intentions... Tonight, I truly have never wanted to kill myself more. I have been crying for the past 6 hours. I know when I am in the wrong and there is no one in the world who beats myself up than me when I am in the wrong, I beat myself up even when I am in the right because I never have people around to reassure me. That being said, I am sure I am not in the wrong in these situations, I am just being tortured for the way I react to being wronged. This doesn't matter though, because there are no people in my life who are willing to not only reassure me with words but also with actions. And when having no reassurance I blame myself for everything. And when blaming myself for everything, I truly dont believe I deserve to be alive. I think im a very bad person, because if i wasnt i wouldnt be so alone. even if i deserve to, it hurts too much to be alive. i have been fighting to stay alive for so long, practically most of my life, because my family situation also sucks. i cant stand the idea of one more day.;I have a very hard time creating relationships in my life, to no fault of my own (?).

I ended up not going through with it simply because it landed on an inconvenient day. A month later, after I turned 16, I told my parents. I have a few questions I would like to have answered bc the people I have to talk to are not being very helpful.1. When I told my parents that I was suicidal, my dad told me that I can’t be suicidal unless I attempted. Is this true? If not, why do I feel so much guilt over it?2. I have a friend who met me at a very stressful point in my life last year (when I started planning. I went thru several date changes.) . We’re really close and I enjoy his company a lot. I feel bad for telling him everytime I want to kms bc I know it makes his anxiety worse but I don’t have anyone else. He has issues with following thru on things (especially events). Everytime he has to cancel, I want to die. Tips on getting rid of this? Also, am I a bad person for using him like this? I hate myself for it but, I only see my therapist every 2 weeks if I’m lucky and sometimes need immediate help without my parents being notified. Is this considered emotional manipulation? If I am a bad person for this, should I just bottle all of this up?3. Am I a bad person for romanticizing my death/ making jokes about it? I have my will drawn up as well as letters written to everyone I have ever known, plus an illustrated funeral plan. Am I a bad person for doing this?4. My parents said I should go to them if I’m having these thoughts again. I don’t want to bc my mom is emotional and my dad doesn’t understand. Is it ok if I lie to them and tell them things are ok? Otherwise my mom is going to get in my personal space and never leave. I just don’t want to have an outburst and hurt them.Thank you so much.

1c7kh4o;Just tired of being born to fail;Khan-_-Seiman;"Just wanna somewhere to tell the truth without feeling guilty about it.I'm 20y male, studying computer science, but struggling af, depression and anxiety have been with me since 13, my parents didn't have cared until my second attempt to kill myself (16y) by jumping from the top of the building we used to live, sadly two friends stopped me, after that night, mom used lockers in all the windows, and I started psychiatric treatment, and from depression and anxiety I got to OCD and social phobia, psychologist every week and the strongest medication a teenager can take, because apparently I have resistance to most substances, including drugs and alcohol, after 6 months of treatment not working well, and my psychiatrist always asking if I heared any voices or seen anything, she asked for an exam, to verify a certain condition that was discovered in some people around the world shortly before. At the next meeting with her I discovered that I had a genetic mutation, and without treatment I could develop other mental disorders like schizophrenia and psychosis besides physical health problems, the medication itself is pretty expensive and hard to get, normal people apparently take one drop daily, and people like me take 42, what makes it even worse, yeah I know it looks like a fic, I wish it was, actually there's even the cursed past, my grand grandmother apparently died in a mental illnesses hospital, and I still what for her to appear in my dreams and tell me how to save the world.Actually, I had a completely common childhood, and even after that, my parents cared a lot, I had pretty bad health problems, but nothing to be really worried about, but I never had any reason to like myself, to like my life, my dad always tell me to try, to become the best of me, but there's nothing good to see, since childhood I'm the type of person who tries to help everyone around without asking anything in exchange, but deep inside I want something, anything to be proud of. Before the treatment started, I had, I had my creativity, my hyper focus state, a great memory, the capability to understand almost anything as easily as if I already knew it, but now there's nothing.I had a girlfriend in high school, but when I got into university, we broke up, I always had to me that my first gf would never be my last, I know, that's pretty mean, but I just try to be realistic, and then I met my second gf, she's with me since.But what's the point of this entire post I ask myself. Well, I think I don't know, some months ago I discovered a knew power, adhd, treatment already started and all, but I don't know, I live far from my family, have no friends anymore, only my gf, but I can't just expect all the problems to be solved by her, since I was a kid I always wanted to study AI, and it's just the biggest luck of all time that when I get into an university it becomes the next step of humankind and all, but, I'm bad at everything, I don't even know how I got here, I'm bad at math, I'm bad at programming, I'm bad at everything I try, I'm just not enough, and u might think ""choose another thing to learn"", that's not the point, I wasn't bad at any of these things, but now I just keep being leitor behind, I really wanted some friends, and I had some really good ones, but they're all gone now. My girlfriend has a dream, the same I have, but I know, for me, it is just a dream, I try so much every day, I study, I give my gf attention, I keep my parents informed of everything, I tell everyone I'll keep going and try again, I will not give up, but I just can't take it anymore, it's been 11 years since the first time I heard that there's a rainbow after the tempest, I keep waiting, until I die, I know it's not gonna be tonight, because the only thing that keeps me alive, the only thing wich has always been with me, is my cowardice.Well, I think that's it, I just wanted to tell it to someone I've been born cursed, but the actual problem is me, no illness, no hard past, no trauma, I'm no good person, I'm a hypocrite, and I know it, there is no karma, there's no God, but if by any chance I could see hope in anything in my life, I swear I would do everything to get there, anything to see what other people see in life, I don't even remember what is the feeling of wanting to live another day.Sorry for the bad English.Thank you for reading this desperate plea.";Just wanna somewhere to tell the truth without feeling guilty about it.I'm 20y male, studying comput;;0;3;2024-04-19 01:23:37;2024-04-19;Friday;01:23:37;4383;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:53.122261

1c7k6r2;I want to leave this sad life behind and start a new one;Depressedindividual7;For as long as I can remember, I've just been existing instead of actually living. That's because I'm a neet unfortunately. (every single day I do absolutely nothing except web surf, watch shows or watch YouTube videos) I've been through elementary school and middle school but never high school. Even when I was in school, I was never too good at it. Both socially and academically. Selective mutism seriously ruined both my life and mental state. I'm also isolated every single day and don't get to regularly hang out with any friends. Because I don't have much and they're too busy for me anyway. I have too many bad memories with my twin sister who is a borderline and who I've not gotten along with since around age 10. It feels mostly like I've wasted my life than I have not and my life is hell as well. The few times I've actually socialized with people, I felt awkward and like I didn't belong. (social pariah.) I also didn't know about the word neet until I was like almost 19 which sucks because I think I've been one since I was at least 13. I just don't exactly have the best life, it's so low quality. I wish I could just die already and be reborn into a new better life. I just wanted to have a normal life but for some reason my life is dull and hellish.

1c7jvn7;Feel powerless to help my suicidal best friend;Future_Sprinkles121;"So just a bit of context: I met my best friend at university studying an art thing, I ended up being quite lucky and got into a relevant industry early on, she struggled a lot to get in and a couple of years into my career I helped her get into a job where we worked together. She had to move to my town for it and we moved in together. In the past year, the industry has become extremely difficult to navigate and we both lost our jobs. It's a universal thing, lots of people with far more experience and wider skillsets are struggling. After months of unemployment, I managed to get another industry job but she's had to take on something entirely different, feels very doomed and can't see a way forward. A lot of other things are compounding on her too, going way back to her childhood, but it's the work situation that's made it come to a head and the worst part is she's always comparing herself to me and being around me makes her more miserable, but... we live together, so I can't exactly not be around her. She has no other close friends either, so the only person she can speak to is one whose very existence makes her miserable (me).I try to be there for her as much as I can, I'll admit lately I'm not great at active listening because a lot of the time she says things like ""how do you do it"" and before I can catch myself I respond with explanations of what I would do differently if I were her and then I instantly regret it. I'm trying to help her manage it and be there for her to talk it out with, but I have to talk her down every night, and she's getting more and more hopeless, so I feel like my capacity to help is diminishing every day. When I suggest getting in touch with hotlines or a therapy service because they'd be better equipped to help than me, she refuses and says there's no point.I'm trying my best to just be there for her and listen, but each day it gets harder and harder to be of any use to her due to my own emotional exhaustion, I'm scared I've said things that have made it worse without ever meaning to. There's also the knowledge that my existence makes her feel horrible. I feel like that makes things even harder because I find myself getting defensive whenever we talk and that can't possibly make me any good at talking her down.I simultaneously can't talk to her about most things because any subject, even seemingly innocuous ones, can set her off, but also I don't want to not talk to her because she's already expressed how isolated she feels and I don't want her to feel in any way like I'm avoiding her or withholding things from her. She's isolated, only has one or two other friends and I don't know if she's likely to tell them about how depressed she truly is, her family is one of the things contributing to how she feels to begin with, is wary of therapy, has basically no inner resources, her mental health is already very poor, and gets no fulfilment or respite at work. This all makes her super high risk and I'm so scared.I don't know what I'm hoping for with this post. I've read the resources on here and they're mostly things I already know. Obviously I'm just going to keep trying be a better and more supportive listener but I'm so scared and starting to feel more and more hopeless myself. Things are looking up for me in my life after a difficult period, but I can't enjoy this - not only because anything going right for me makes my best friend feel even worse, but because I have to live with the very real fear of her committing suicide. Tonight she kept saying that she doesn't want to do it anymore, she's tired, and she doesn't care if other people are sad because she doesn't want to live for other people. Which makes sense. But it makes me so afraid. I'm so useless to her and I can't do anything about it. It's selfish of me to say this but I don't know how I'm going to live with myself if she kills herself. It feels like I'm the only one that can do anything about it and I'm failing her.";So just a bit of context: I met my best friend at university studying an art thing, I ended up being;;1;2;2024-04-19 00:54:28;2024-04-19;Friday;00:54:28;3974;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:53.130209

I went through some crazy abuse a few years ago where I seriously thought it was the end for me. I overcame it, and I experienced how fucking beautiful life is for a little while. I have so many things I didn't have when I first felt suicidal, or when I was being abused. I have friends now that I know love and want me around. I know my family loves me. I love my body, I am active, I am very healthy. I have aspirations and am constantly fulfilling my short term goals. I have my own hobbies. Literally I am doing everything they tell you to do to fight suicidal urges in the book.   I still want to fucking die.   I don't know why. I think this fact will just never change. I mostly feel it on my period, but it's such a strong feeling. Even if it's caused by my menstrual cycle, I don't know how I'm going to live the next 30 years feeling like this every month. Every morning I remind myself of the small things I want to live for, or the people I want to spend time with for longer instead of perishing.

I don't want to deal with being sad and stupid and alone, and I can't think straight anymore. There really is no point to living any longer, so why can't I just cut to the chase?

1c7j09c;I tried to kill myself last week;benthebetamale;It was right after a school field trip to see a Broadway show which would seem not triggering at all except that I have never felt more alone than in drama club. It fucking sucks because I don't even think I can enjoy a production that I'm not in because it makes me think about my experiences. How my director would say im not enough, or the 2 other time I tried to kill myself immediately following drama club rehearsals.And I loved everyone in drama club I looked up to them, I wanted nothing but their acceptance and reciprocation to any extent. The field trip was open to all music students which included almost all members of drama club. I tried really hard to socialize or get any closer. After just kinda failing, I isolated for the rest of the trip while people were conversing and having fun on the bus ride home.Going into this I felt like it was one last chance to be worth anything to anyone. I had the idea even initially of ending it if I were to blew it. It was just an ideation though.But it stuck with me, that feeling of fruitlessness and worthlessness (you know the drill). I'm suicidal all the time but it was odd to me that the intensity of my suicidality remained as high for so long.2 days later it reached its peak. My mom left home in the morning to teach a fitness class as she does every monday, and there wasn't school that day. I was home alone for a long time. I wanted to call a friend about what I was about to do to myself, but I don't have any friends in the sense that there is a mutual care. That was kind of the last realization that pushed me to do what I did.My mom knows I've tried to kms in the past using the dogs' leashes to hang myself but she was NOT good at hiding them lmfao. They were literally just in the closet of her room so I grabbed one of them. It always seemed too complicated to me to tie a proper noose (more likely im just lazy) so I just tied some makeshift noose that I tied to the railing to the stairs at my house. Again my methods aren't like the usual way people hang themselves but they're what I did. The railing isn't high enough above the ground so I couldn't really hang per se so I had the rope around my neck tightly and was like standing on the ground by my tippy toes. It's hard to really paint that image but it was well able to bring me closer to death.I just kind of stayed there. I thought it was no use but the longer I was there the more difficult it became to breath. Then I couldn't actually tell if I was unconscious at a point because there's a part in between that is like a blur to me. Eventually breathing took all my strength as I began to black out. I was dizzy, I could feel the pounding of my heartbeats, and I was terrified. Not terrified of death but of this turbulent and chaotic state before. My body would instinctually not let me stay there. I screamed out and I remember the looks on my dogs faces as they turned to me confused lol. It was difficult and I had to exert myself in a severely weakened state to untie the leash from my neck. I did, breathing heavily and with a big mark on my neck. I just kind of recooperated after that but I was in shock to be alive.It was so damn surreal and I cried and screamed that I failed. Almost instantly I regretted untying myself. What's worse is that a failed suicide attempt didn't bring me any solace (obviously) since I didn't feel my life magically affirmed like George Bailey. I think I felt more intensely suicidal then than the moments before and during the suicide attempt.I felt even more worthless than before I just lacked the initiative to try anything that I had before, and I was both physically and mentally exhausted. I didn't have the energy to try again at suicide so I tried to ease myself by cutting, I mean it was the only coping strategy that actually works for me. My mom also hid the knives from me but I found a serrated kitchen knife in her drawer and cut my wrist a couple times. It helped for moment but the intensity of the suicidality came back.So I just kinda sat with it and nothing really changed. I still have no friends, no one cares about me still and I still hate everything about me. I still honestly think that suicide is the right choice, for everyone burdened by me. I honestly don't know what the hell is even gonna happen. I haven't and won't tell anyone like a therapist of social worker about this because I don't want to go back to the psych ward.I guess if something happens to me in the foreseeable future than that means I was strong enough to remove the burden that is my life. But hey we'll see lmfao.;It was right after a school field trip to see a Broadway show which would seem not triggering at all;;1;1;2024-04-19 00:12:12;2024-04-19;Friday;00:12:12;4595;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:53.150302

And yes im probably just another edgy teen acting as if they think life is meaningless but no. Its just that lately things have been super fucking shitty, and by that i mean i literally dont wanna wake up anymore. Recently ive felt like this, just going to school, talking to my friends, my parents even, its just all to much. A couple months ago i probably wouldn't have said this, thinking my life is going great and that everything is fine, but i can think like that anymore, i dont wanna think anything anymore. Being around others is so exhausting, being touched (mostly hugging) by my family is a disgusting thing, hearing my mom say she loves me feels unreal, my whole life ive delt with arguing and crying, that the words 'i love you' dont really mean anything anymore, that sentence is just an excuse to get out of being a shitty person in my family. And it really effects me, i dont want to grow up, ill end up turning into my mom, or somehow worse than her.Whenever i get home from school i cant do anything except sleep, hoping i dont have to wake up. I have almost zero motivation to do things i like, as for an example, drawing. Picking up a pecil and just drawing a circle makes me wanna stab myself with it. I literally can't live on like this. I probably won't kill myself because my mom (and other family members) will probably join me after or become alcoholics.So overall i probably sound just really fucking whiny, a little bitch that can't find light in things anymore. What ive said in this post isnt even as deep as my feelings go, theres other reasons i cant do this anymore, but im not going to say that online to strangers. Im sorry for invading is group with my whiny thoughts.

1c7ifx2;Things have been happening that make me want to killed myself;iloveshotahentai;I've kept a few details out in case anyone I know finds out it's me.I'm in the Army working with people's paperwork and I constantly mess up due to my anxiety. I've gotten so many counselings that I often have to hold back tears and cry in my car whenever I get out of work. My anxiety causes me to forget on how to do my job, so I have to constantly annoy my coworkers for help. I know that they're done with me because I overheard my NCOIC say to not help me if I ask for help when I was doing something for a commander. I'm currently flagged for both my weight and for something else that I can't talk about. My NCOIC and NCO possibly want me out of the Army due to my constant mess ups. Which I don't blame them. I aslo know that my 1SG also hates me based on the way he speaks to me now and the first time we met. He looks down everyone who is not athletic as he is. I've also resorted to drug use to cope with work but it backfired way bad. It made my life worse and caused my work to plummet even more. I'm finally almost one month clean which I am proud of myself, but I'm scared that I might fall back into drug use.I'm going to talk with my battalion's chaplain and see if he can listen to me and let me vent judgment free.

1c7i770;I Think I'm Inferior to Women;Softcreamsoda;"EDIT: I think I should've put ""feel like"" instead of ""think"". This isn't like a concrete belief that I have. Just a feeling. (Throwaway account cus this is embarrassing) People talk a lot about how beautiful women's bodies are and the incredible things they can do, and it makes me feel like a lesser person I guess. Pregnancy is a big trigger for me. After my mom had my little sister, she said she wishes men could experience the same thing and I agree. They saying feel your child within yourself is one of the best feelings on the world. I've heard a lot of people say that women are superior/more important to the world because of that. I don't wanna be less important. Like, I don't wanna be a father cus watching my partner bear a child will just remind me of all this and make me feel like the lesser parent. And I wanna be beautiful too, but I can't really find anything about being male that comes close to that and it kinda kills me. Another thing is that women go through a lot of pain. Birth is one and periods are another. This might be why they are more celebrated because their bodies put them through a lot of hurt, but as a result it makes me feel less worthy of praise or celebration for being male. Just less worthy of feeling sad for my own pain, and receiving sympathy or empathy or whatever.And then there's male expendability, the thing where men are sacrificed to protect women and children. I wanna be protected too, and I (funnily enough) don't really wanna die.All of this makes me so upset and angry and sad that at points it makes me forget everything else and want to kill myself. I want to be proud to be male and be comfortable with myself while also appreciating women for who they are, but it all just makes me angry and kinda resentful towards women.(I'm not trans but I wanna wear skirts and dresses too or even put flowers in my hair but I can't bring myself to aohwehfudhehrifh)";"EDIT: I think I should've put ""feel like"" instead of ""think"".

1c7hz92;I'd like a conversation;Smart_Curve_5784;Hi. If it is a private conversation, I would like to talk to those aged 24 and older.People generally desire a sense of belonging, feeling connected to someone. There are endless reasons to not want to go on anymore. Positive feelings of being connected can soothe one's mind and make the reality a little bit more bearable. I've been experiencing suicidal ideation for a long time now. I do not have any plans to act on it, but I am very tired. Life can be beautiful, but not everybody gets to experience that perspective, and not all of the time. And, when feeling alone, one gets worn out quickly. The world is dark, and I would love to talk with people who want to share their thoughts about what's offending them about this reality. Facing it alone is such a heavy burden, and my shoulders are tired. And even though life sucks, there is beauty in defiance.  TLDR: Basically, if you are hungry for a long conversation, I'd love to try having it;Hi.

She says she wants to keep trying to make things better, but I can see the forest through the trees. She doesn’t seem like she’s really trying.Without her, life has no meaning. I have no friends, she was my only friend- I did everything I could to pay for a beautiful ring. But it was all for nothing I suppose, how can I ever trust her again after she’d threaten to leave me alone over two months of fights here and there?- I have apologized so so many times over the last month, bought her gifts, given her space, begged for forgiveness.. but still distant and cold to me. Now she wants more space- should I trust her, and give it to her? While she still wears her ring, my heart is already broken. I am thinking of just switching the car on in the garage and letting myself finally be at peace- no bloody mess, no suffering, just a warm and peaceful sleep into what comes next. Like one of those old romantic stories or something. My mom would find me most likely, and I know it would devastate her because I’m the only family she has left- she does have a boyfriend.

1c7hehi;My childhood best friend seems to have a sense for when I'm on the verge of killing myself.;Existing_Worry_6433;When I (28) was 17 I planned on killing myself one night after my family went to bed. I made no indication that I was thinking this, didn't text anyone or post about it anywhere. I was literally making plans with a friend that I knew I would never get to. A little more than six months prior my childhood best friend cut all contact with me, which I didnt even fully realize at the time. She never told me we were done or anything, she simply stopped replying/answering the phone. She was never the easiest to communicate with so I didnt realize at first, but the longer it went on I began to understand that we just weren't friends anymore,  and I wouldnt have answers as to why.My suicidal ideation had been going on for years, and the rift between us was not a driving force or anything, though I guess it was technically a factor. I felt lonely but also so unworthy of anyone's love, like a burden and just someone people occasionally took pity on. That night I was acting totally fine while truly believing it was the end for me, when she randomly texted me to apologize for cutting me off, it was because of her boyfriend and she wanted to talk, etc. I was totally blown away because I'd never even considered that she might get back in touch with meObviously I didnt kill myself that night because I just... had to know what the fuck happened.We stayed in touch after that, with her promising it would never happen again. Things were good for several years, although she still had the habit of not answering messages. We saw each other often, though, and for the most part our relationship was great. In 2017 I had a breakdown that stemmed from a panic attack, and wound up standing on the side of a bridge wanting to jump.  I messaged her asking if she was busy (a thing i did all the time with no/delayed response) thinking that if she answered i would tell her about the panic attack, assuming that she wouldn't. For whatever reason she decided to immediately text back, and she ended up meeting me at a nearby park and talking me down from the state I was in.Last night she texted me about talking tonight (she moved across the country several years back, which has lessened our communication quite a bit) which seemed out of the blue. I have been struggling extra hard with my mental health lately, but we havent talked much since the beginning of the year so she wouldnt know that. Today became one of those 'straw that breaks the camel's back' kind of days, which is how I ended up on a throwaway in this subreddit. In the back of my head I've been thinking how weird it is that she seems to know when I'm like this. Even before it got this bad. I was debating the likelihood of the phone call actually happening while typing this, and she literally just texted me a time/a reminder.I guess all this to say I'm not killing myself today, because apparently has some kind of sixth sense of how to interest me enough to keep me alive. It is kind of weird though, isnt it?;When I (28) was 17 I planned on killing myself one night after my family went to bed.

1c7h54u;barely scraping out alive;thereconcile;[discussion of self harm and abuse is in this post]Hi. I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I am. I'm a 21 year old trans man, survivor of chronic abuse of all types and the foster care system.  I relapsed on cutting for the first time in months today. My longest streak. I told my partner about it, and I think each time I'm wedging a wound within our relationship.  Today, I opened up about how work in particular has been making me extremely suicidal, with each shift it is seeming to get worse and worse. I sobbed in their arms for the first time in months. I felt weak. I still feel frail.   My existence has been a horribly beautiful book, and I'm not done writing it. The seriousness of my illness is getting worse, however.   My last psych inpatient was the first time I was truly ready to die. It took two years, in and out of the hospital, to finally feel at peace with my suicide note.  Sorry, this is all over the place.  I had a method planned. I've been reconsidering that method as of late. I am stuck in a cycle, eating my own mind over and over. I'm no longer passively suicidal, over the years. I am safe in my enviornment, but unsafe in my own mind. I still can't take my meds regularly. I've still been thinking of cutting myself and killing myself constantly. I'm still the same child I was when I was first abused. I'm lost.  I guess I just want to be heard, not to die. I will admit myself into the hospital if I cannot make it through work next week, but I'm trying so hard to stay alive. I apologize for asking and not giving so much to this community, but I need some sort of reassurance, I suppose.  There's plenty more to my story, but for now this is what is relevant.

1c7faw5;I can't roll with the punches anymore.;D09ukhan;I will not commit suicide. But everything seems so fucked beyond fixable. Have no ambition to be better. So sick of getting shamed and made fun of. Not able to take walk outside without thinking how miserable I am. Even though there might be some uncontrollable causes that made me what I am right now, I feel like everything I dislike or suffer in my life is there because of me. I'm in a constant phase of changing moods. When I feel good, I don't think I deserve it. Goes the same when I feel depressed. I have two sides of me fighting about everything I think of. At first, when I was a kid, I thought I must be different then other people cause I have been seeing everyone being so certain about themselves. I'm only now able to see how naive of a thought that was. Do I need to say that I am terrible with girls too? We can chat a bit and I might seem cool (meant as I am not a weirdo) but I know I am. Also afraid that you would know that only person I talk to, is you. In a loser way not meant to say that I am turning plates. (Is this the correct term?).I'm not satisfied with how I look or dress. Both of which are things I cannot change at this moment. Not untill summer at least. Which effects how I see myself as a person. I wish to be perfect, my perfect self not some angelic bs. At least a bit taller I guess, might like some less hair too. Then I say to myself I do have a functioning body and live in a good condition, for now at least, which is better than most get tbh. But it bothers me so much that I won't be able to experience life as those who I envy. I always shoo away these thoughts with some jokes made by myself for myself. But as I said before I do not have the capacity to roll with the punches anymore.I can see how I would be made fun of if I would ever post a picture of myself or like said someone 'lets be friends?'. I can't cope with the loneliness anymore. It's not like I don't talk to people. I am much able to have a decent conversation with someone I just met. The problem is meeting them and what to do after meeting them? What should I do to get over my fear of people not liking me or me being nothing more than a headache to them. I know most people do think like this but I am just afraid.  I live in a country where saying hi to someone, especially the opposite gender, would put you in a bad situation. This wasn't like this when I was a kid. You used to be able to hold and play with other people's kids when I was one of them. People used to trust their neighbors. Now people just assume you are a creep even if you smile to a baby or pass-by someone on the road a little closer than they expect. I'm not old I must say. I born in early 00s. Would love to seek professional help but those are expensive just like how I would like a shit box to learn a bit of car mechanicing. Or learning how to skii. These are luxury in my country. Just for those lucky bunch whose family either were actually honest earners or scumbags who just happened to have a good scheme going on for themselves. I am balding which was unexpected cause my grandpas had hair and my dad has it too. So when I accepted balding I talked about it with my family. I said 'I am balding do you think it's because if stress?' and the answer I got was 'stress? do you work so you can put food on the table? what do you have going on with your life to have stress about?'. Yeah I guess I don't have nothing going on with my life maybe that's the problem, dad?Whatever this was a lil vent about myself by me.

1c7f6cd;i feel so fucking useless.;Slaiday;As you have read in the title, that's how I've been feeling these past days.  I (20M), decided to switch colleges and careers after doing International Relations for almost 2 years. I started IR when I was 18, and after almost two years I decided to quit it because of some internal problems the college was having at the time, but now I feel like a burden to my parents because they're the ones that were paying for IR back then, and they're also the ones that will be paying for Political Science in this new college. Even though they told me it doesn't matter if I needed to start from scratch, I feel so guilty because the almost two years that I spent studying IR I could've invested them in working and gaining experience for saving money and helping them paying for the college tuition. Careers over here last at least from 4 to 5 years, meaning that I'll graduate at 24 while all of my school friends will graduate at 22-23. After making this big decision my mind has turned into a complete mess. I constantly compare myself to people that are my age that are already making money while im here, being a fucking burden to my parents and starting from scratch in a new college. I also feel like i do not deserve any of the privileges they give me because of how useless i am. These types of thoughts have gotten so bad, that there are times were i think to myself that everything would be better if i just were dead. Something that also fuels this is the fact that my parents at my age were already doing lots of stuff while im here, starting from zero a new career.

I can’t date, I don’t trust anybody or see the point of giving someone my time and energy. My family are weird and unloving. When I was doing really well I flew them all around in First Class, looked after them but in the years of not being able to do that they treat me in the most disgusting degrading way. I have good friends but I don’t think it’s enough to really want to stay. I’m sick of watching what I eat and working out… for what? I give no fucks. Oh and I have a mystery illness!

But the moment i leaned over i set off an alarm that i didn't know was there cause i've never been to the top do the garage. and it kept saying ""you are in a restricted area walk away from the ledge"" i got spooked and ran away to meet up with my brother who was gonna take me home but he made me wait 20 minutes and i was so scared someone was gonna come up to me but they didn't. i don't know how to feel i feel so raw and weird about everything, i guess this was my sign. i feel like a ghost wandering around blind i don't understand anything and i just feel like im living in a fever dream. i'm so lost and so alone i can't feel anything and i just want to let go but it's like something's not letting me. if  anyone have any advice or words of wisdom i would really appreciate it i feel so lost.";hi everyone i don't really have anyone in my personal life to talk to about what just happened so i ;;1;1;2024-04-18 20:43:45;2024-04-18;Thursday;20:43:45;1703;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:54.273103

1c7dxcb;Should I just give up?;icyspicyburner;My boyfriend of almost a year left me 5 weeks ago and he's already with someone else. I don't feel anything towards anyone but him. Every night I dream about him and being with him again. Last night, I dreamt about him and his new partner. It made me feel so nauseous and I've been feeling nauseous 24/7 since he left me. My friend has stopped talking to me. I have nobody else to talk to in my life and my ex has blocked me on everything because I refused to talk to his new partner. I'm trying to reach out to him because I'm concerned for our mutual friend but I'm losing hope. Nobody cares about me. I tried texting the crisis text line multiple times but I kept having my conversation closed. I imagined marrying that man and having a family with him. I am in so much mental and physical anguish. My body is giving up on me and I can't do the things I used to anymore. Any time I listen to a song or watch a video with something romantic or sexual in it, it makes me want to die. I want to have a future with him, but hes with someone else. I can't move on. I just seriously think life isn't worth it. This pain and suffering needs to end. I'm tired of living this way and nobody would care if I died. I have nobody in my life. No friends, nothing comforts me anymore, I can't distract myself. I am in constant and chronic pain. Every second that I'm away from my ex, I get sicker and more nauseous. He managed to move on, but I'm still a wreck. I just want someone to care about me. Nobody could love me like he did. I can't love anyone but him. My life seems like it's coming to an end. I have nothing to look forward to in the future. No husband, no family, no kids that I can love and adore for the rest of my life. I can't even listen to music because if there's a slight romantic or sexual reference I have a panic attack. I can't go out in public. The thoughts of him and his partner make me sick and theyre constant. I can't stop thinking about it. Every second of every day, I remember how I wasn't good enough and that he doesn't care about me if I died. I don't want to end it all, but it feels like that's becoming my only option. I just want him back, but even then the damage has been done. He was sexual and romantic with someone else. My friend and him hid that from me, 'for my own safety'. Lying hurts more. I don't want to be here. I just want to die. Why won't God take me away? Why won't I die in my sleep? End it all. Let me die. Please. I'm suffering so badly. I want it to stop. I want my peace.

I don't have friends, I don't have supportive family, and my online presence is all but ignored. Think that South Park episode with the kid on FB with no friends. I'm 24, nonbinary, not that it really matters because nobody sees me as anything but male. And I've been struggling with my mental health for the past twelve or so years. I'm on medication, but it's not actually doing anything anymore, so I stopped taking it (fantastic idea I know). I suffer from severe OCD, not the quirky ""everything must be clean"" kind, the ""4 hour long showers, handwashing 20 times a day, unable to exist in public spaces or keep a job kind"". I'm also depressed, barely get out of bed, I'm an alcohol abuser and I binge eat. Basically, I'm a complete waste of life. A lot of you in this sub have redeeming qualities, I've read your posts. I believe I am genuinely deserving of death. I live with my parents due to my financial situation, I didn't attend posy secondary, I've been burnt out since high school. I don't have friends, my social circle is people I meet on dating apps (which is few and far between, because life had to make me hideous too). These people talk to me for a few days, maybe a week, lose interest, and Ghost me. I've tried reaching out, hell I've posted on FB my plans to Off myself and begging people to reach out. Of course nobody did. If I were to die today, I'd leave behind absolutely nothing but unresolved credit card debt and disappointed parents. My funeral probably wouldn't fill the first row of pews in whatever Christian church they decide to do it in. I mean absolutely nothing to anybody, my parents have made it clear that I, their only child, am a disappointment and a waste of resources. I will die alone, I am unable to make connections and am too fucked in the head to keep them. My last relationship lasted three months and according to him was completely one-sided. I'm sorry this is long, I'm just really struggling to accept that I failed as a human, and I'm putting this out there so maybe if there's one other person struggling like me they don't give up like I have. But I know nobody is reading this anyway. It's a TL:DR, and not worth anybody time. And for anybody that might say ""it gets better"", it doesn't always. I hope it does for you, I really do.

1c7bk88;Reasons to keep going;Ur_Nans_STD;"A little too say: I have been where you are right now and it is horrible I know but here is some reasons to keep fighting. If the message doesn’t help you ignore it, it just needs to help one person. The decision to remain alive can be deeply personal and will differ for each individual, but here are some general reasons you might consider before doing anything:	1.	Change is Constant: Life is always changing, and feelings, especially intense ones, tend to shift over time. Situations that seem unbearable now might look different with the passage of time.	2.	Unseen Possibilities: There might be experiences, people, and places that can bring joy and meaning to your life that you haven’t encountered yet. Staying alive means keeping those possibilities open.	3.	Impact on Others: Your life has a significant impact on the people around you, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. Your existence is valued and meaningful to friends, family, and sometimes even to those you might not realize.	4.	Help is Available: There are resources and people ready to support you through hard times, including professionals trained to work with those having suicidal thoughts. Reaching out to them can bring relief and open paths to healing.	5.	Discovering Strength and Resilience: Overcoming difficult periods can lead to personal growth and resilience. Many people find that enduring tough times helps them discover their inner strength.	6.	The Opportunity to Help Others: Your experiences, particularly overcoming struggles, can put you in a unique position to help others who might be facing similar challenges.	7.	Personal Fulfillment: There are goals and dreams that are unique to you; staying alive means you still can achieve them and find fulfillment in the pursuit.For those struggling with these thoughts, it’s crucial to speak with professionals who can provide immediate help and support.";A little too say: I have been where you are right now and it is horrible I know but here is some rea;;0;1;2024-04-18 19:04:30;2024-04-18;Thursday;19:04:30;1893;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:24.530000

1c7b2lu;I tried killing myself ;Beautiful_Wing_4675;"Its been 7+ yrs, if we count the abuse as a child its been 18+ yrs I can't go on anymore. I have always been good I tried living as the best grandson, son. I don't go out. I don't date, I don't smoke/drink or even party around. I was beaten to death cause I m average in everything so my grades weren't up there when I was 5 ( I always wrote the alphabet C in an inverse way) so my mom beat me enough to scrap my skin and rub chillies on those marks then she threw me in the bathroom with lights off to clean myself for 30 mins ( I was probably 4). My dad broke my finger and countless times slapped me hard enough to male my nose bleed ( it wasn't normal bleeding with 3 or 4 drops of blood infact he beat me hard enough to soak my towel) I got beat up for others, I got beat up for my grades, I got beat up for mistakes, I got beat up for being improper ( bad language the mildest bad language word, not enough respect, speaking in between adults, infact I got beat up by strangers as well lile my tutor or my relatives) I got beat up all my childhood and at some point I legit couldn't feel pain anymore infact I kind of started liking pain ( I'll get to this part). So That was just my childhood honestly It wasn't all bad I worked my ass off to please my parents so they did kind of reward me sometimes and I had my granny. But the last 7 yrs were hell Every single day I wished I was dead I m simply not a guy to give up I don't fear death but I don't like the idea of suicide but I can't anymore I habe had it. It all started when my parents got alcoholic ig being kinda rich and everything going their way alcohol was the best for them. But with that my mother started having an affair( beginning of her affair) it was those facebook scams that trap you with the eventual goal being money. My father found out at the end but the thing is we don't do divorces in my country plus I was just a kid and I had a sister just 7yrs old. So he let her off easy time passed my mom had ger second affair this one got nasty like it was a married man and father came to know of it. They had a big argument my mother OD'd on pills and attempted suicide so he let her off. My mother is an obnoxious, arrogant women so she had another affair but not with one she had multiple guys this time. My father knew of it he got really alcoholic they had constant argument we moved to a bigger house with neighbours all around. My mother didn't stop she kept on doing it my my parents fight got nastier they started having fights my father got abusive I stepped in multiple times to save my sister and mother, One time I tried saving my mother and she lied infront of me that it was I who was playing with her phone ( I was 14 ) and my father almost knocked 2 of my teeths a punch a slap everything. (he might not be big but he is 5.10 and as a person that handles 100's of workers his hands are big and hard). But it wasn't the pain that hurt it was the betrayal when she threw me under the bus and the fact that even tho my father knew she was lying he still took his anger out on me. Prior to this from when they started fighting I felt a strange feeling in my chest Idk if we can call it pain but Even tho I had built up a shit ton of pain tolerance this feeling was the worst the soft arguments that led to big fights scared me the moment my mother or father started speaking in a rough voice I got scared this was the worst feeling. And then that day came This was the worst day in my life. In a neighborhood filled with my frnds my father being the drunkard found those flirty messages on my mom's phone and beat us up and started his charade from 11 pm to 6 am. And at the end of it he went out and screamed and started crying and cussing us while being drunk in front of that one nasty neighbour he screamed in the middle of the road 15 families were watching (I was honestly a proud kid I had an ego I worked my ass for everything) and that felt like public humiliation. My uncle picked me up and we stayed at my granny's and this is where the ties with granny ( the only person I have ever loved ) started withering. My granny wanted a house big house so my parents ( they are very charitable unless it comes to me) started building my granny along with my grandpa a house and my grandparents saud we would get half of it. But eventually my nuncle had a kid and they talked my grandparents to get us out of that will ( it was an agreement) they haven't been able to but they don't want to gove us that house even tho we built it. But well I won't dive that in. So my granny changed and this was the worst betrayal due to those fights at home a night I called her and asked for them to let me stay and the instant rejection was the worst thing I have felt. But I m not flimsy I was angry we drifted apart and I still can't forgive her. Now onto the main and last part of it. its been almost 5 yrs since that day every day was hell they did manage to calm those fights I tried everything. And the main factor was that we got poor we lost everything the savings went in building the house. So no alcohol but when they drink its always a fcking fight and I have gotten used to it besides the sharp pain in my chest. We have moved around 5 tines atleast we sold off all properties in covid my father got scammed twice and he couldn't do shit cause he is a pussy and can only raise his hands at me or my sister / mother. My mother is  still an obnoxious cheating bitch so they basically have an open relationship. in the past few months my father found some big work but everything has failed it's like we are given hope but someone snatches it last moment and today was the same. The work was almost finalized but the investors pulled a sick joke last moment And to top it off my parents were drinking so that drunk ruined it by badmouthing the investor. And I losing all hope tried to kill myself seriously for the first time. But little info I survived all these years cause I had my devices like my ipad/ pc or my phone. Anime/books/games helped me keepp my mind off I haven't been to school even tho I was the top of the class for the last 2 years cause They can't pay the fees anymore. But the lifespan of my devices are not infinite one after one every thing has stopped working even my phone (the last device is at its end) so I dk how long I'll last. My hands are full of scars the sharp pain in my chest is frequent so causing pain helps me calm. Back to it I couldn't handle these hopeless feeling I have tried killing myself before but I honestly couldn't pull it but today was different I slit my wrist and the blood started gushing out of it I wanted to stop the fight so I called them hoping they would stop but ig I wasn't smart enough to know that they don't give af my parents knows I was harming myself but did that stop them from alcohol? No. My father in a drunk state said let him die while my mother kind if cried holding my hand stopping the blood. After that they still started fighting again. I wasn't hoping for love or some care I just wanted them to stop fighting. After half an hour that drunk bastard comes in again and ask for my hand. And I just wanted to be alone but he forced me to show him. He said "" I know all your acting. Don't overact I know how much you can act and forced me to show him"" At that point I couldn't hold it anymore after he left I had this deep cry that I have never had. Sometimes I just wish I had enough money to get out of this country and leave these people but I can't leave my sister alone. Do suicide is really the only optionBefore anybody judges me you should take in account that I have also beat up that drunk bastard twice ( 1 and a half year back) I snapped and beat him up twice kicking himand stuff when he came in my room trying to beat me up cause I said something and I snapped So no way m I a good son but I don't regret that much.

1c7ajuo;Cry of desperation to the void;EmmaTheFlamingo;Hello void, we meet again. I tried to get better, I really feel like I tried... Yet I fell back into the hole that I so desperately tried to climb out of. I guess this part of me was always right, the thoughts of being truly fucked were right...Dysphoria was right, I look like a man. I was stupid to delude myself to think I even had a chance. I feel like a monster, a mockery of women around me. My face is too masculine, my voice sounds like I'm taking the piss, I have no curves, I'm too tall and broad... Even surgery (if I could ever even make enough money to see it through) wouldn't save me... My transition is a failure... Waste of 2 years worth of hormones...Lately I've been super low energy to do anything but sleep. Even others in my life commented how all I do after work is sleep... I don't even have the energy to clean the apartment and my roommate has had enough of my crap...I'm a horrible person, started burning bridges over misunderstandings and can't even fix it...I break down whenever I get any critique from people in my life...I'm not made for this world. I lost my chance of ever being happy or not feeling deeply broken... My end is prewritten, I just don't know if I can keep deluding myself to push on. I hope to finally join you, void. You're the only place that can take my pain away... I'm truly broken...;Hello void, we meet again. I tried to get better, I really feel like I tried...

1c77wd6;My antidepressants don’t work, they made me gain weight, they made me sexually incapable, tired and dizzy. I don’t know what to do ;That_sarcastic_bxtch;"I’ve told the nurse (infirmière praticienne spécialisée) that I don’t want them anymore. She wants me to try another antidepressant and when I asked her if it could make me gain weight, she said it could. I don’t understand why I would want another pill that probably won’t work and that will make me keep gaining weight. Even if it did work, I don’t care, it can’t really work because I don’t want to be fat and that in itself makes me unhappy. I’m trying to tell her I don’t want to try anything else and apparently my input isn’t valuable. I guess I could just not take the pills, but I’m currently in a supervised appartement with a program for young adults, and they’re watching me closely. I know of a guy that got kicked out from the program because he stopped taking his pills that made him agressive without consulting his doctor.I was alright with my old pills that didn’t work, Prozac. I was able to maintain my weight at around 150 lbs and I was happy with that. She gave me Effexor and everything went wrong, I gained 30 lbs in a few months, I tried to stop it, I limited myself to 1600 cals, I skipped meals, I worked out, and when that didn’t work, I gave up and started gaining weight even faster. I’ve gained 70 lbs in total, and it’s not stopping. I’ve tried to find answers online, but the general consensus is that it’s “calories in, calories out”. I say maybe it’s not as simple as that. I’ve asked other people who took Effexor, and apparently, they couldn’t lose the weight even after stopping it! I fucked up my whole metabolism by accepting to take it, I trusted the experts and they fucked me up forever, I don’t know what to do.I don’t see any solutions, I get intrusive thoughts about slicing my stomach open and ripping the fat out with my bare hands, I think about getting the tapeworm eggs pills from the 50s, I think about starving myself until I can see a positive change. Even if I managed to lose the weight, I’d have loose skin everywhere. I don’t have money, I couldn’t possibly get it surgically removed. Wtf would I be supposed to do, cut it?There’s no magical pills that can treat depression, I’ve tried like 8 and only Prozac didn’t have awful side effects; it had no effect at all. You tell specialists you’re unhappy, you get pills that makes you fat and make it so you’re unable to cum, tired and dizzy. That’s my experience.

1c75wcr;I might as well confess as I’ll be gone during Summer ;SireneMoon;I made the decision to finally end it. After loads of contemplation, I finally began relenting my old things and preparing myself mentally for my own suicide. Of course, I’m not encouraging anyone to do the same but I figured that due to failing all my college classes, I have no hope for making money in the future. I’m already a 20F and go to McGill and life has just been giving me so many kicks in the face after I had recently started getting better. ATP I don’t know if I was cursed by an old presumed “friend” or if it’s just my karma or bad luck activating now but yeah…I’ve been in love with the same guy who will never love me for years now and delusionally believe deep down that he loves me. My lifelong dream of going to Japan and dedicating years of self-study (a decade) just to do student exchange someday to now realize that it’ll never happen and I won’t be young as I want to when I want it to happen. All I can hope for now is that, in my next life, I reincarnate as someone with better luck and that my attempt be a success this time. What else?..oh I’m a shit older sister who doesn’t do enough around the house, rarely gets praised for the things I do right. We get a puppy and the burden all falls on me and we never had a dog before so ofc the blame for not training him properly sighI’m just rewatching all my faves for one last time and listening to music I liked.;I made the decision to finally end it.

1c75t0m;My goodbye. ;nesszanessza;Hi all.I guess my title explain everything. I'm going to end my life today. I'm going to do the only thing I have control over. I don't even know why I'm posting this. There is nothing you could say that would stop me. The funny thing is, I instantly feel calm. I have been thinking of this for a long time now. I always had something I could grab into. I always said I will live for my sister, I will live for my cat, for the sheer hatred I feel towards my dad. Now, if I think about it, if I think about all the people who are alone, who have nothing and no one, I feel nothing anymore. I wish could give my life to them. The truth is that I'm an utter failiure. I never achived anything in my life. I'm 27(f) and I'm suffocating. I know it's stupid and selfish, but I truly cannot do this anymore. All I ever wanted was to feel loved. All I ever wanted was to feel like a princess. To feel special. To feel that I have worth, to feel like I like myself. To not feel like I am ruining my own life. To not feel like I ruin everything. All the years of therapy has been a waste. The funny thing is, I confessed to my crush today. Obviously he does not like me. I mean, why would he? I don't even like myself. It's not the reason I am killing myself today, but just the last push. The push I needed to finally see clearly - shit will never get better. Sure, you have nice days, but those are temporary and the pain will always come back. The pain is the only thing that never goes away. I always wanted to be a princess. Turns out, I am just the frog. And I don't want to be the frog anymore. Goodbye y'all. I wish nothing but the best for you.;Hi all.I guess my title explain everything. I'm going to end my life today.

I’m a very soft emotional person and I never do anything sexual with anyone…I don’t know…I made an exception because I trusted him because of how long we had known each other.

1c75q0z;My story Part 2;Same-Difference-5889;Ok so my last post about the time when my parents found out about my suicide plan.  You might be wondering why? Why does this person want to end this gift that is life? That is always the 1st question that pops in everyone's head right.   So a little about myself- I'm a 20 yr old girl. Got a stable financially well off family. My parents always been incredibly supportive of all my choices. Never really forbid on having any boyfriends (altho I never really had one). I got a 13 year old sister as well. We have our usual sibling fights, but in all we have a good relationship. So my family thing is not a problem. I have always been shy and introverted, altho I am not as introverted since I joined college 2 years ago. I got some close old friends as well. My college is good, I got great friends, we have all sorts of fun. No romantic relationship problems, because I'm not in one. Life is just stable. Life feels just like I'm existing in a simulation sometimes.  That's part of why feeling suicidal and getting depressed makes me feel so fking guilty. I have everything any child could ever ask for, yet I don't wanna live. God I hate this part of myself.;Ok so my last post about the time when my parents found out about my suicide plan.

1c755md;Fake suicide or running away;Nearby_Treat2520;"I'm just tired of everything. I feel like everything goes so so fast and I stay the same, trying to keep up the pace. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and  I SH often, but it's things like light cuts, punching myself, scratching my skin, etc. As you see it's nothing serious or life-threatening, mostly because I fear death so much. But at the same time, I really don't like my current life. I'm dissatisfied with it and I don't find any joy in anything or anyone, every day is so overwhelming and just trying to be alive seems like a chore. I'm tired of crying in my room and unconsciously waiting for someone to come helped, hug me, and tell me that everything will be okay..because I know that won't happen. I'm almost completely alone.My emotions are uncontrollable and I really really really don't want to live like this anymore. I'm a bad person (which you'll see in the next paragraph); because of these emotions, I hurt, abandon and overall act rude towards people. I try to do my best, I really do, but I can't control myself sometimes and being aware of what I did afterwards is so embarrassing and makes me feel (understandably) guilty. I suspect I have undiagnosed BPD but I've never been to a therapist, I just read books about the topic and it's so relatable. I don't want to say for sure tho, ofc.So, about the title: first, by fake suicide I mean trying to make it as if I tried to kill myself and failed but in reality I didn't really intend to die from the start. Maybe cutting in some place that bleeds but not so much, trying to overdose with pills that can't actually kill me, and so on. I'll admit I just want the attention that comes afterwards. And well, yes, that's pretty fucking selfish and I shouldn't play with the emotions of my loved ones like that, but I feel like I don't really matter that much to anyone; yes, I have friends, but I'm not anyone's best friend or favorite person. I'm just easily replaceable. The only thing I want is for everyone to understand how bad I feel. To understand that it's something serious and I suffer each and every day.The other option is running away. I'm a minor so I live with my parents, and this house is asphyxiating. Sometimes I get the urge to run out to the woods and live there by myself away from people. And well that's exactly what I want to do. Run somewhere far away and just keep living by myself, or waiting until someone finds me.I understand these are kind of extreme measures. That I should talk to my loved ones and that should make me feel better. Well of course I tried. I talked to them and they tried to cheer me up, and it did feel better for a bit, but then I just got worse again. Every good thing lasts so so little, and each day it lasts even less.  I don't remember a time I was truly happy. Ever since I was very, very little I had negative thoughts about myself,, about the world, about the people that surround me.. and suicide is something on the back of my mind since immemorial times. But lately that voice that tells me I should not be alive keeps getting louder and louder. I'm tired of feeling inferior to everyone and feeling like I don't fit in and blah blah blah. You get the point: I'm tired and need to change.So yeah, what do y'all think.";I'm just tired of everything.

Feeling like being autistic and fundamentally wrong;Hesperus07;"TW: Child abuse, bullying, medical traumaI’m suffering so much from the chronic illnesses. If I’m gonna die now it would be painful. So I would like to use my parents’ money to get them treated so maybe I can find some relief, idk, then die.They’re quite abusive. They’re the type of people I’ll never want any contact with, yet still feel so wrong to waste their money knowing that I’m gonna die.The pain is very overwhelming, both physically and mentally. I’m autistic and I probably wouldn’t be able to get a job and I’m too afraid of leaving the abusive family: I don’t think I would be able to survive in other places, maybe I’m wrong, but the stress is truly overwhelming. I’m living with one of the abuser now; today I decided that I will not resist if they took me back to the abusive household cause the healthcare is easier to access there, but I’m too afraid to show up in the house. I’m terrified that they would house arrest me there as what they did before and I wouldn’t be able to go back to school. Maybe, maybe I’m just too stressed.I really don’t know what to do. I don’t feel like I’m accepted anywhere. Sometimes people are being kind but I have to do my best to mask(which is still visibly autistic)to fit in. I don’t wanna waste my life on this, but I’ve already pissed off too many people. My PCP yelled at me days ago because I seem too anxious, dissociating and stuttering, failing to make eye contact with her. Too many people have treated me like I’m a prisoner(I don’t think prisoner should be treated this way no human should be treated this way and animals as well.) like I was some poor stray dogs that they could kick for fun.IDK what to do. I want respect and acceptance, but no I can’t find it anywhere. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere and there’s no point of living, especially suffering from so much untreated chronic illnesses. I wish doctors could take me seriously. Idk how can I  work on making efforts so they’ll trust my words.I wanna go no contact with my family since they abuse me and gave me those horrible chronic illnesses but I don’t know how to survive. I wouldn’t be able to get a life either. Life is not gonna magically gets better and I have to face the fact that I’m homeless mentally and maybe physically and I’m not being accepted anywhere no matter how hard I try. People are being kind maybe it’s just I’m the problem myself. Maybe everything is wrong from the beginning; I had the sense pretty strong recently, my life is a lie and it’s not worth living both in a personal sense and a social sense. I’m a burden, a suffering one.My body hurts too much. A crisis team’s gonna follow up with me in the near future and I have to lie to them about the abuse because I’m too scared that the abusers will know and send me back to the cult permanently. I used to live in a cultish closed culture which everyone abuses their kids and nobody cares and they’re no therapy or social work services or governmental interventions. Little psychiatry but it’s poor and violates multiple rules and policies, no privacy, poor knowledge and they misdiagnosed and prescribed wrong meds that might kill me(which is how I’m being treated before).

1c703v6;I've done everything but it never gets easier;EmilyDawning;I'm so tired of this pain. I started dissociating in 2021 after an SA that brought back all the trauma of my CSA..  I left work on FMLA because I started losing time, hours gone in the blink of an eye, doing things I had no memory of. I joined a partial hospitalization program, and from there I did intensive outpatient. I did transcranial magnetic stimulation. I went inpatient and started electroconvulsive therapy, which I continued in an outpatient capacity after being pushed out of the ward. I had a therapist, a psychiatrist, a social case worker all helping me.. I lost my job and lived on disability for two years, during which I did an intensive DBT program for 15 months. Once my long term disability finally ended last year, I was finally approved for medical assistance.. but I can't actually use it, because it has a monthly spenddown that I literally can't cover after paying rent and bills, even if I went without food. So since 2023 I have had no therapy, no psychiatry.. my psychiatrist even gave me a free session to get me one last round of meds to try to help, but I can't afford a replacement, and I'm running out, and I'm so much worse without my meds.I keep thinking going inpatient again might be nice, because at least then I could eat, I could be around people instead of entirely alone with no family or friends or even pets. But it just seems so pointless. It's not going to change the reasons I'm so hurt. I'm 43 soon, I'm trans so I'm constantly confronted by how I'm not wanted by the majority of the world. I'm so, so poor now. I'll never get gender affirming care to help my trans issues get any relief. I'll never be able to date again, with agoraphobia and social anxiety, it's hard to even go outside. The ECT fried my brains so I have trouble thinking and my memory is shot and those two things were the only skills I had when I was employed. I can't imagine working again, not at anything that would give me enough money to improve my life over what it is right now. I have physical issues that make it hard for me to do physical labor for any length of time, on top of severe depression killing my motivation.I just... feel like there's no cure, you know? I did all the things people tell you to do when you feel like I do. I called the hotlines. I called 911 at my last attempt (all it got me was a huge ambulance bill that then went to collections and constant phone calls). I did everything I was allowed to do, and it never stops. I've been fighting these feelings since I was 15. Soon I'll have been fighting suicidal urges for 30 years? What kind of quality of life is that?I wish I'd just done it when I was 15. Of 43 years, exactly 4 years have felt worth living, and I struggled with mental illness for those, too.

Ptsd has ruined my life. Can't afford proper therapy. I'm a NEET at 24. Freelancer, but live off my parents.The only thing I live for is my DND sessions every week. When that's done, I'm going to kill myself.I'm a fucking burden. Everyone says I'm too negative, too much, too this, too that... Fuck. Im from an indegenious group and I really wish I lived back with my tribe 200 years ago, with family and friends and not this shit.I'm so fucking drunk. I hate myself and my life. I just don't see a future for myself. I'm angry all the time. Bitter. I can't love people, I'm always on guard.I'll die alone if I keep living this way.;I have no close friends, don't talk to anyone.

1c6zgw7;Idk dude ;No-Cryptographer1992;Lowkey man I just genuinely feel like not living (my bad for getting straight to the point)  Ik people got way more struggles than I probably do but I have been so lost in life that I don’t know what imma do when I’m out of school. I have had a plan if nothing gets interesting in my life by the time I’m 25 I’m probably just gonna leave this little planet. Thing is my time is nearly done in a couple years which bothers me cause I have done nothing in life. I’ve been trying to cut off the drugs, alcohol, everything just so I can feel better cause that’s what people have been telling me to do. I’ve been trying to lock in with school but my grades are still fucked even if I try with cheating on work I just can’t seem to get any better with anything. I would try and distract my self with instruments like a guitar so I can clear my mind with things. And I got sum problems with a girl cause we were lowkey also locked in but I think she just lost interest but I could probably care less now n she’s just doing petty things that are just making my head have a migraine but I try not to let it get the best of me. I tried getting a job, can’t get one. I feel like I’m just disappointing my mother every day and it’s just like I want to stop. But really how is my death gonna affect my family. Probably the only motivation I got to keep living is to keep my family neutral. But it’s just killing me I do want to end it soon but fuck man these decisions just makes me live because I know if I do anything there will be dire consequences within my family. I’ve been also trying to talk to people about what I’m just thinking of but I don’t think they can help. I want to talk to my parents about it but they had trauma over my dads brother suicide n I just don’t want to repeat history again. The plan i had that I mentioned at the top of this thread where I was gonna die at 25. My way is to just cut everyone off in a slowly manner which Ive been starting to do this year, I have had 10 close friends now I’m down with 4 so the plan is working I’m barley telling my siblings anything, I would often tell them of my substance abuse and they did make me stop at one point but yk how a addict is. I feel like if I just had a day to talk with my self but a young version of me before I got into drugs I would tell him what not to do to not end up like this in the future but shit man we here now we suicidal.

It all fell apart the day the person I love left, it felt like my world crumbled.It’s not like I can’t find another person but it just doesn’t return the lost colors, I don’t get excited or happy at the thought of it or in the moment. Plus I love my ex, I really don’t think I can ever fall in love with another person so that ship has sailed.I have talked to professional therapists but nothing seem to truly help. It feels like something has truly died inside me.I have tried making friends, trying new things out, going to the gym, trying to learn French but I just do these things, I don’t feel anything from them.I have been thinking about death a lot, I am alive because my mother loves me but if it wasn’t for her, I don’t think I would want to live.I don’t really have people I talk to and honestly I haven’t tried much lately to build connections. I feel like in the end it all falls apart anyways.At one point I was truly so happy, I used to get scared at the thought of my life ending during old age, I had dreams, I had hope, I smiled but now it all feels like a distant memory, like something I read in a story book. I don’t remember that person anymore. I see my older pictures and it seems surreal to see myself smile.It’s kinda funny how now I welcome death, hoping to find peace in it.I have tried almost for 2 years to find happiness in at least some sort of thing, anything but truly it feels like I don’t even remember how to.I wish I knew what is wrong with me.It’s scary that only thing that comforts me is sleeping and never waking up one day.;No matter what I do, hobbies, activities even buying things I think I would like, I don’t feel happi;;1;5;2024-04-18 09:51:56;2024-04-18;Thursday;09:51:56;1854;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:55.875362

1c6z36e;Every day is torture.;Otherys;"My mother has always held an unhealthy attachment to me. According to her, she cannot eat, sleep, or even go to work because of me. Every moment I am not in her sight, she worries that something is going to happen. Our relationship, thus, has primarily been a game of tug-of-war over my basic boundaries and privacy, and her extreme paranoia.She controls everything.Until she gives me permission, I must not wake up. I have to stay on the bed. Even if I am awake. This is because my mother needs to start her day and complete her rituals until I start mine, so she can supervise me. She starts her day an hour before me—breakfast, shower, make-up, clothes, etc. Once she is fully ready, she goes into my bedroom and sings a tune to ""wake me up,"" something she saw good families do in Hallmark movies. After that, without leaving the bed, I must make conversation with her for an entire 30 minutes, consisting entirely of her life (not that there's anything interesting in mine).Once she gets bored with the conversation, we head to the washroom. She first brushes my teeth, which I am incapable of doing because of my ""retardd intelligence and short attention span"". After that, she makes me strip nude, and checks my body for any extra weight or stretch marks. By then, I am already holding my bladder in, but I must not use the toilet. No, I have to squat down on the floor next to the toilet and piss into a bowl with her still watching.She justifies this by saying that I am addicted to drugs and am not to be trusted. This is because I tested positive for a drug test. What she is not telling you, is that she was the one who put the drugs in my food after I became more rebellious when my age turned double-digits. I obviously could not obtain drugs by myself as with my level of supervision, it is impossible, because I have no private spaces and am not allowed to leave the house without her as an escort. My mother uses the drug test as a threat.If I do not comply with her demands regarding her entitlement to my privacy, she will report me for taking drugs and get me arrested and marked on my record.There is no way out of this. I tried to stop eating her drugged food, by locking myself in my room to hide, but that resulted in withdrawals. Had I kept at it, I either would have starved to death or my mother would finally call the police. If she did, then the withdrawals, worsening mental state, weight loss, and my mother's acting would have only served as further evidence against me. Even if they collected the drugged food independent of me, she would claim it as me trying to distribute it to her and getting her addicted too, thus getting me arrested for even worse crimes. The police will never believe a teen over their own parent. And how could I expect them to? They probably have never seen this type of shit in their careers. If they had, the parent was probably obviously psychotic on the outside, and that only serves to make my mother seem innocent by comparison.That's why, no matter how shameful and embarrassing it may be, I must follow the rules. After she takes the bowl and gets her positive test, I head to the shower. I am not permitted to wash and scrub myself. She must do it. She does not do it properly, in order to make sure I do not learn how to do it myself, as well as to mock me for being smelly and incompetent. After we finish with that, I make my way back to my bedroom where she selects the clothes I will wear for the day, and, of course, she dresses me herself. Then, we head to the dining table where I eat the tampered food. She must spoon-feed me herself to ensure I am actually eating it.The last main thing I have to do is read my last entry in a Gratitude Journal that my mom got for me on Mother's Day. The journal is supposed to represent my gratitude and gratefulness to my mother, and most of all, my debt to her for raising me. On the first page is a statement that this journal represents my will, and is to be used as testimony for everything my mother did for me, as I surely will ""forget and deny"" it once I am an adult, followed by my nonconsensual signature. Every entry starts off with a ""Pledge of Allegiance"" to my mother, consisting off mind-numbing repetitive sentences like ""Honor your mother and father. Respect your mother and father. Show obedience to your mother and father. Kneel to your mother and father. Praise your mother and father."" I feel like I'm being brainwashed every time I read them, as is probably the intention. Following that up is a record of everything I did in that day, with the good parts being attributed to my mother, and the ""bad parts"" being attributed to myself. If I ever mess up and am deemed to have done something bad, I must write a three-paragraph essay that is basically apologizing, begging for forgiveness, and detailing the punishment I deserve for my misdeeds.All in all, before we even reach lunch, I am thoroughly traumatized. For the rest of the day, I am in a blur of despair. Any productivity, motivation, and discipline I have is shot. It is torture for me to even lift a finger. All I do is try to defend myself against the rushing PTSD flashbacks of my shitty life, and then inevitably surrender to the dissociation, by which point I am unconscious until the next day.And the cycle begins again.I don't know how to stop it.";My mother has always held an unhealthy attachment to me.

1c6yml4;I am at rock bottom, and staying alive takes all of my strength.;Internal_Number_6876;"For many years I struggled in silence with intense anxiety and depression. These feelings started to control my life, and changed how I perceived the world. My anxiety would induce panic attacks, and keep me awake at night, and it also made me uncomfortable with my surroundings. My depression created intense self-hatred that eventually turned into obsessive thoughts of self-harm and suicide. Eventually I started to develop paranoia as well.My life throughout those years was usually that of service, and throwing my own desires to the side. I had to take care of family, and worked a stress inducing job that I hated. None the less, I survived, and dealt with it. Eventually I was able to move out by myself, and live my own life. However, by that time I felt ""numb"" to the world, and most things were emotionally exhausting. I thought that was okay, and that perhaps with time id be able to ""feel"" again. Sadly, that was the beginning of the WORST period of my lifeEventually, things came to a head, and I went through a series of mini-breakdowns that became more destructive. I felt isolate, and inable to make connections.I had a neighbor that approached me. She was kind, and we became friendly, and eventually intimate. However, she could also be dismissive and saracastic. I tried to be open with her about my issues, and about our relationship, but she was often either drunk, or unwilling to be responsive. Eventually, I started to blow up on her. However.. that was just the beginningOne night, one of her friends verbally assaulted me, and threated to harm me. My mind at the time was clearly falling apart, and I assumed she had something to do with it. I texted and called, said some terrible things, and then threatened her.. and then I went outside and damaged her vehicle. I felt so bad about it, told her to call the police and I was arrested.Immediately after this incident, I went through a period of a few days of being stuck in bed, considering my own suicide. My mother had to help me out....Now, I am trying to build myself back up.... feeling more alone than ever before...and every day I struggle with suicidal thoughts... if I am not consistent on working on myself (which is exhausting), I feel the need to end my life.";For many years I struggled in silence with intense anxiety and depression.

I've had this editing task for months and I keep making it worse.. I add and delete and rewrite the same words until its all a mess. I've spent nearly a decade getting nowhere, my advisor resents me and for good reason. I can't do basic tasks. Everyday I spend hours rewriting the same sentences and second guessing things. Nothing feels right. I can't make any decisions and the paper is so bad. It's humiliating I've spent so long doing this and getting nowhere. I used to be respected by the people in my department but that was a long time ago. I've been in OCD therapy for a year, but it isn't helping. My therapist keeps making excuses for me. But excuses don't change the reality and the reality is I'm going to turn 30 and I won't have anything to  show for all the misery this degree has put me through. I'm going to be alone on my birthday trying to meet a deadline that I know I can't meet. And this one is real. My advisor lied to extend the deadline for me twice already, and her ass is on the line if I don't finish. But I'm not going to. There isn't enough time. I've wasted all the time I've had either avoiding the task or doing it the exact wrong way.  I even hired an editor to help me, which is fucking pathetic, and now I'm hiding from the editor because I can't get him even a rough version of a chapter to look at. I really don't see any other way out. I've been thinking about it for a while but I don't have the spine for it. I'm a coward. And I can't leave my cat. I'm not going to make the deadline. I need help but people offer and I can't take them up on it because I'm ashamed. I've taken at least 20 years off my life with stress, cigarretts and adderral trying to accomplish something and now the failure I've always felt was inevitable is around the corner. I can't bear it anymore. My parents would be heartbroken but I know I'm already breaking their hearts b/c I never see or talk to them and I'm a fuck up.

1c6xpqp;I just want to die;Ilovecars24;Im sitting here realizing this. I really want to. Its not even a wanting the pain to stop sort of thing. I want to die for the sake of dying. I want it to be unpleasant. I like to go to the little river near my house, and go out to this rock in the middle and sit there, surrounded by the water. Its really nice. It's one of the only places I go. I could stare at the water for hours. But everytime i go there i can't get the thoughts out of me head. Theres a bigger river not too far from me. Known for being rather dangerous. Its got strong currents, and even the strongest of swimmers drown in it, and often they don't find the bodies for months, if ever. It would be so easy. And it meets my desires, of painful/unpleasant, but also doesn't take too long. Like id be scared with like overdosing or something it would work except that it would kill me very slowly of like organ failure or something over like a week or something. Drowning isn't the fastest way to die (also what I want) but it won't take that long, in the grand scheme of things. A good middle-ground. And i love water. I love the ocean and the rivers. I think there is a river flowing through my soul somewhere. Im finding myself making a plan yet again. I really want it. I really do. I feel like i have things to do. But those things seem so impossible to achieve. So like what's even the point. Im trying to get myself to try to get more poems published? But they will probably get rejected and im tired. Im so tired. Whats the point? Ive published 1 poem ever in a literary magazine, and every other time my poems have just been rejected. Maybe im just awful at poetry and at everything else. Everyone told me I had a talent for writing growing up, and they still do. it feels like my only redeeming quality. But i can't seem to be good enough at it. And my visual art is boring and repetitive. And i haven't be able to practice music in months. Everything is getting worse.  I am failing uni, I can't get myself to write or draw or practice guitar, I can't seem to get a job. I feel like im being spied on or something all the time, and it feels so real and people say it isn't but it feel too real. sometimes I hear things, I can't do anything right. :(;Im sitting here realizing this.

But in my sophomore year of high school I took 2500mg of ibuprofen. Because I thought I wanted to end it all but, I was hit with instant regret and I tried to get it out of my system but it was just too late. So since I was already skipping school for the day I thought if I’m gunna die I might as well be surrounded by the one thing I loved at the house at the time so I brought in my dog. But I broke down, because I was scared so I called poison control and I just kept calling them over and over again because I was just so scared. They told me I would survive but I just didn’t believe them. So I just accepted my fate, I brought my dog with me to my bed room and I was just freezing, it was almost like I was hit. By a wave of just coldness, so I turned the heaters on max and grabbed as many blankets as I could to just stay warm. And I just felt myself getting tired, and when I woke up I just saw my dad yelling at me for having the heaters on full blast and I was just in awe. I didn’t think I would survived that. But think about that, most people say they have instant regret after they do somthing like that. So just think in the long run, would it affect me a month from now or a year from now.

1c6w8a8;I can't take it anymore ;misanthropeman91;"I (15m) can't take it anymore. It's like im living but I don't really feel alive, let me explain. Im from Italy, specifically South Italy even if i was born in the North. My mother died when i was 2 years old, I wish I had known her. Since then i live with my father who is the best father in the world. I have a few big sisters but they was born from a different mother who they still live with in the North. I feel like they didn't really care about me, yeah they came here to visit us for a few times but now they don't do it anymore for like 4 years.Since I was little i was an introvert kid who really didn't like to socialize, but I still had some friends in elementary school, but things changed a lot when middle school started. I knew most of the people in my new class but just one of them was my ""friend"", if we can call him like that. We saw each other just in school, he didn't really want to hang out with me. We learned to know each other and once that period finished a group who was formed in the class started bullying me for no reason at all, or maybe because i didnt knew the dialect of the zone. In the group there was also my ""friend"", but at least he didn't participate. In that time my father gifted me a computer, and I was the happiest young boy in the world. When I returned home from school I would most likely play with my computer all day, i even met a few online friends who are the reason I'm still alive right now. So just imagine, a young boy in middle school with no friends and no social life who is wasting the best years by staying on his computer all day. In that years I started to develope homicidal thoughts towards other, still now they are even more intense. When I had my middle school exam, which I did really well, I hoped that in high school I could find some friends, but I was wrong. I started high school this years at September and we were in 5, just boys. I thought they were ok, but they immediately started to bully me after 1 month. I can't understand why tbh. All I do now is staying on my computer all day, I have no social life, no friends, they bully me, homicidal thoughts and no one seems to care about me. I hate everyone, i hate people, i feel like I'm going insane. I'm thinking maybe I should end it all and kill myself, who will care besides my father anyway?

But currently I don't know if the state let's me keep it. I won't get money for my work anymore. Will be dependent on my family again. Every person who gives advice on youtube/podcasts and so on says their friends or their relationship saved them. I always had to save myself. I'm almost 30 now. Young for some people, I know. But I wanted to die since I was 8. Always got my hopes up, climbed out of my hole, things got better - BAM - another thing that knocked me back down. Again and again and again and again. I can't get back up anymore on my own. I'm so tired. If I lose this ""work"", I will contact an organisation for assisted suicide. You have to be a member for 6 months before they help you to do it. So I can make sure that nothing changes my mind. Cause I have so many fantasies in the back of my head about how my life could turn out, but that are just dreams that I can't achieve. I tried.

1c6vyxk;Ruminating on the past ;Such_Masterpiece4085;My nighttime anxiety gets really bad. Like really bad. I start ruminating on childhood friendships, and how they got to live out their dreams, get a career, move to the city, and genuinely seem like they’re doing better off than me. They cut me out of their life for a reason. I was going no where in life and it was easy to tell at a young age. I had undiagnosed ADHD, maybe some tism and just generally a toxic, party druggy person and an embarrassment once I hit burn out from not being able to keep up with school, extra curriculars and a social life. Fast forward to now I got out of my toxic household, been living with my sweet fiancé and had the right space to actually reflect on my actions. I think it’s mainly because I don’t have any friends now, and I never got to leave my hometown either and I don’t leave my house. I was too hung up on the wrong things and made a series of bad choices that wound me up not leaving, missing out on life and having severe fomo, depression and anxiety because I’m 27, unemployed and just a loser. I miss the childhood friends I used to have. I stalk their social media from time to time and my heart aches. I think part of me knows I fucked up and they weren’t perfect either but I’m kinda living out their fallacy of not amounting to anything in life which I think hurts the most. I’ve been trying and trying to get a job, something to impress the people who gave up on me a long time ago to be like look I made it. I did something with my life you just needed to see it through but I can’t even seem to get a part time position in this job market. I don’t really see this getting better, like significantly better. I just see myself stagnant, feeling small and insignificant, and just defeated by my past. I’m sorry for anyone who reads this, I just needed to vent. I’ve tried to get closer with God but he doesn’t even feel like he’s with me. My life already feels over at 27 and though I might not commit suicide, I think about it everyday.;My nighttime anxiety gets really bad. Like really bad.

I can’t even get out of bed in the morning because I don’t even know who I am anymore. I did well in high school and ended up getting a full ride to college, but I’m throwing it all down the drain for something I don’t even want to do. I’ve felt so much pressure from my family to follow a STEM path, but I’m so fucking tired of it I can’t do it anymore. I’m in an early MBA program too where I take one business course a semester, and those classes are the only thing that has actually gotten me up in the morning. My gpa is definitely going to fall below the requirement for that program after this semester though so I’m losing the only thing I enjoy here. I’m meeting with an advisor to switch majors to financial engineering because I’m tired of trying to be someone I don’t want to be, but I still have to make it through the last two weeks of this semester without fucking everything up. I have to earn 67% of attempted credits to keep my scholarship, but I’m so fucked in every class. I have so little self confidence left, I used to be an incredible test taker, but now I just freeze up every time and my mind goes completely blank and I can’t even properly read sentences. I’ve dealt with depression my whole life and I’ve been to the therapist’s office more times than I can count, but I honestly feel like this is the lowest point of my life. I’ve lost over 10 pounds this semester and I can feel my body slowly dying from the inside. My physical health has turned to complete shit which is only making my mental problems worse. And the thought of having to face my parents and tell them I lost everything is destroying me. I honestly considered crashing my car into a fucking tree on the way home today just so I won’t have to deal with this issue. I’m so disappointed in myself and how far I’ve let this go.

If you're reading this please go help someone that actually needs it, i just want to be heard and rant about my problems.I'm 17, and I have some really bad mental issues. I do not have the money to go to therapy, but I figured I probably have BDP (Borderline Personality Disorder). Ever since I was 8 and bullied in school i had suicide thoughts, almost every day for years. When i was 12 I swore to end it all in my 16 birthday and started self harming myself. I won't enter in details, but this continues for many years, and in the middle of it all, some suicide attemps. when i was 14-15 i was in a bad mental state but not enough to try to end my life. I had my first girlfriends, that ended hurting everyone in the way, even my friends. and being so bad to everyone made me realize that in all my years of living, i did harm to everyone involved in any way to me. I wanted to change, to be better and to redeem myself making the world slightly better than i found it. I stopped the self-harm, and lived by the phrase of Luis Alberto Spinetta ""Even if they force me, i won't ever say, that the past was better. Tomorrow will be better."" (the original was in spanish lol). Well, 3 years has passed since that, and tomorrow wasn't better. My life is shit. I almost don't sleep at all. My family is another problem in itself. My friends doesn't seem to care about me. I don't have any self-steem, I hate how i look, i hate my personality, and i think i'm bad at everything i do. I have a crippling coffee addiction. And I don't ever want to talk about my romantic life. My last 2 relationships seriously traumatized me and destroyed the little self-steem i had.And even, after all of this, i can't improve in any way the life of others, my mere existence is actually worsening things for my family and to everyone really. I can't do suicide, for now, but I won't deny that i'm considering it. Everyday is a struggle to not do self-harm again, since it was very difficult to me to stop doing it, and i don't wanna be in that type of thing again.I'm at a bad mental place at 3 in the morning and i'm not really thinking what i write, so my english must be trash. sorry for that, it's not my first language.thanks for reading, if someone does, at all";First of all, probably won't do any serious harm to me or anyone, so i do not need that kind of help;;0;5;2024-04-18 05:24:55;2024-04-18;Thursday;05:24:55;2350;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:27.167890
1c6vgvx;9 days left alive;Nylith2019;It's a strange feeling being able to see the finish line. It's frightening, comforting, depressing, and thrilling all at the same time. I still feel like a selfish monster for choosing this, but my self-hatred is stronger than my guilt. In my last few weeks my perception of life has shifted monumentally. While there's a lot of pain and suffering in life, I find myself trying to savor what little good remains. I didn't expect my impending suicide to make me so mindful of the positive things. It's easier to fully appreciate them when you know you don't have much time left.I've also been attempting to reconcile with my fear of death. Honestly, it's more of an apprehension though. No one knows what happens after death and I'm worried about what I may find. Strangely enough though, I've begun to take comfort in the fact that death is inevitable. Regardless of whether I kill myself next week or not, I will die someday. I'll have to face death eventually, it's just a matter of when.I've managed to spend time with most of my closest loved ones before the end, and I'm very glad that I have. However, it makes me sad when they start planning future events with me since I know they'll never come to fruition. I would be graduating in May for example and my parents are very excited about it. It breaks my heart whenever they talk about it.I don't really know why I've been posting these updates. I'm not looking for someone to stop me and I know advice is unlikely to make me feel better. I think maybe I just want someone to hear this and understand me. It's incredibly lonely being like this.

What about in a butchers then - I mean you said before that it's got use for curing meats... NOPE! 0.5%-6% with a bunch of herbs and shit mixed in, same issue as on amazon.  Okay, what about internationally - I heard Poland is quite lax on it... NOPE! same issue, they're fine with it in person but on the internet? no dice  Oy okay okay, what about the spooky scary dark web - you can get just about anything you want on there right?... NOPE! NOPE! NOPE! NOPE! Checked dozens of DNM's and no dice, nada, not even a single grain.  WHY IS IT SO HARD TO JUST KILL MYSELF IN A NICE WAY?  Why is it that if I want to die I have to go out messily falling from a building, or overdose on some random shit pill that's more likely to make me explode out my asshole and piss blood than kill me, or try handing myself and end up quadriplegic?  Why is it so hard to just sit in bed with a nice cup of tea (laced with SN), some biscuits, and a good tv programme before fainting and having it all over and done with.  Rant over, sorry I know this is very different to the normal posts on here but not being able to kill myself has just made me realise why I want to kill myself so badly - no matter how hard I try nothing ever works, I can't even fucking kill myself right.I just wanted her to love me, but that will never happen so I'm trying to settle for just ending it... but I can't even do that.It's no wonder no one loves me when I can't even fucking kill myself right.;Preface - this is half rant, half suicide note, half general breakdown.

1c6v7oe;hi;Responsible-Home-636;"i never told anyone about this, i just want to vent, sorry for the spelling mistakes cuz english isn't my first language.. can someone tell me what they think about this please?? idkwhen i turned 13, my older sister started to cut herself. We were on quarantine, 2021, so we were home all day everyday. In 2021 she started to cut herself, and she made me know it. I always saw the cuts in her legs because her shorts were too short or things like that.. She used to put her razon inside her phone case, and sometimes i threw to the trash other razors she had, trying to make her stop or something, but then she would go to me and look at me badly and complain to me without saying what it was but telling me things like ""you did it"" or things like that.That year i started cutting myself too, I really wanted to die. The second or third time I did it with a cutter that I found somewhere.  When I came out of the bathroom after cuttig myself, my older sister said ""welcome"" to me with a smile, like making fun of me or i don't know.. it was so surreal.  I guess she saw that the cutter wasn't where it always was, so she assumed i was cutting myself and she was right.  But I don't understand why she would tell me that, I would never do something like that, especially if I had a younger sister, it just doesn't makes sense One time she took a new cutter from a box somewhere in my house, she put it in his pocket and started telling me that she was going to swallow one of the razors of the cutter, that she was going to kill herself with the other, and I don't know what else, she said that to me jokingly as if it was funny.  it was so horrible.. one time she called me to bring her a shampoo upstairs and when i opened the door she grabbed the shampoo from my hand with her uncovered arm full of cuts. Showing them to me.. then she closed the door and i went downstairs to cry and whatever. So much more things like that happened. That whole year I tried to have the courage to tell my parents that my older sister was self-harming, but I never could, I never had the courage.  All year I saw how she went into the bathroom for a long time, cutting herself, and then she came out looking depressed.  I almost always knew when she cut herself and i couldn't do anything, i didn't know what to do, i literally couldn't do anything, i didn't know how to do it. How to help, nothing. I wanted to do something and i never could. That year i tried to kill myself many times, and none of them worked. Other mental problems appeared that year, such as DID, and I had hallucinations almost every day.  i used to cry every day, i cried when I woke up because I didn't want to live, i used to overdose with pills a lot, i felt anxious every day without stopping for a single second. Also in 2022, less than a year later, I couldn't remember when it had happened or how much time it happened, everything had been blocked due to the trauma and it was so horrible. To this day I still have those problemsMy older sister stopped cutting herself at the end of 2021 because my mom found out she self-harmed, so she had to stop. When my mom found of she was doing that, she made everyone worry about her and told me that we had to help her, but she never cared about me in the same way, but whateverI'm really happy that she stopped cutting herself, but I still can't stop self-harming and I'm covered with scars over both my arms and legs, scars way much worse than the only ones my older sister has. and no one cares to make me stop, everyone knows and it's like no one cares. But whatever, I hate myself too much for this and I will never forgive myself for what i did. I hate myself so much and I hate my 13 year old self so much for being so fucking stupid and useless, i can't get this out of my head";i never told anyone about this, i just want to vent, sorry for the spelling mistakes cuz english isn;;1;6;2024-04-18 05:08:18;2024-04-18;Thursday;05:08:18;3793;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:55.938640

1c6uyf6;Stopped Caring About My Own Life;Mellevaputa;"Hello all, this is the first post I've ever made anywhere; I don't expect it to go anywhere and really I'm just doing it to get this off my chest, as I have no one else to talk to about it. I have been suicidal for many, many years; in my 28 years of life I don't remember a single day in which my mind didn't bring these thoughts at least once, I have lived in a contant state of self-deprication and self-hatred my entire life. The problem with this being that every time I feel like I'm getting better, like I want to push forward and continue living, something happens that reminds me of why I've wanted to die for so long. I'd never finish if I list everything that's happened, so I will summarize it as best I can. 1. All the good people in my family are dead; they all died in quick succession in a span of 4 years. It is just me and my brother left. 2. The rest of the family that I have left are all a bunch of backstabbing, lying bastards. They kicked us out of our own home under false charges of domestic abuse, ruined my reputation, pretended to care only to steal a bunch of money from me, accused my brother of being a pedo,  then the rest of the family who offered to help us left us to die once it was convenient for them to do so. 3. I have been bullied my whole life by everyone; siblings, parents, classmates, coworkers; the list goes on and on. 4. 4. My mother was abusive; she was manipulative and cruel, kept on hitting me and yelling at me for no reason, punished me unfairly all throughout my childhood, and tried to exploit me once I became an adult; overall, she is an awful human being. 5. Tried to kill myself when I was 16, and failed. Didn't use a strong enough type of poison apparently. Left with chronic health conditions as a result.The list goes on and on.... Point is, I'm tired. I'm so fucking done with life I don't even have the energy to kill myself anymore. Besides, I still have my brother, the only one who has proven to be an honest person, who has gone through all that I have beside me; my death would surely affect him badly, to the point I fear it would be what would lead him over the edge. So I've decided I won't kill myself... Yet I won't make an effort to prevent my own death either. These chronic conditions have been worsening lately, and I am also dealing with some ""real life"" problems with money and stuff; yet I am so done I don't even care what tomorrow brings. My heart could stop right now that I wouldn't make an effort to try and save myself, I could become homeless and my sole reaction would be to lay in a corner and let myself pass on...TLDR: I don't care about my own life, or what happens to me; after all I've been through, if life will continue to be the same, it is not worth living. It can throw anything it wants at me, I'm done fighting.";"Hello all, this is the first post I've ever made anywhere; I don't expect it to go anywhere and real";;1;3;2024-04-18 04:52:53;2024-04-18;Thursday;04:52:53;2815;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:56.871676

I am now sleeping in my car. I have no supports, no family, my closest friends that I had before, I found out one used me and another is getting very abusive(which is why I'm sleeping in my car, because we are also, technically, roommates). I've reached out to the supports I thought I had to help with any advice on getting out of this situation and most of them turned me down with even just helping. All because they don't want to get involved in this situation. Even heard from one of them ""if they hit you, it wouldn't really hurt, though. I mean, you're bigger than them, they're pretty small"". Which is just rough, another has just been avoiding me since I reached out. I have no family, I aged out of the fostercare system. I've called every shelter around. All turned me down. Domestic shelter told me they can't help until they have done a provable act of violence. Homeless shelters here are gendered and have turned me down. I am a trans guy so men's shelters are concerned I might be unsafe there and women's shelters don't want to put me in a spot where I'm misgendered.

I am a useless waste of space that’s incapable of outputting anything of value. The longer I’m alive, the more apparent my uselessness is. I’ve never dated a single person and chances are, I never will. I’m entirely repulsive. I just annoy everyone around me. No one would ever want to date me. I should just accept that by now. Even if I did end up dating someone, they’d just get hurt when I inevitably kill myself. I don’t even know why I haven’t done it yet. There’s no longer a reason to live other than cowardice. I’m too much of a fucking coward to actually do it but I’m unable to ever improve my mental health. I’m forever stuck in a never ending limbo of mental anguish that envelopes my entire being. I just need something instant and painless. Even the world hates me. All because I’m a faggot. The world only grows to hate me more and more. Even now, as I write this, I’m just using this to build confidence to finally end it. Hopefully there is no afterlife. Hopefully I simply cease to exist. I can’t do it now though. I must suffer a bit longer. Earlier, I was unsurprisingly rejected by someone. If I do it now, they could think it’s because of them. Don’t say I’m only saying this because I was rejected.

1c6u548;I can't get rid of this guilt. Why did I say that? How do I make it better?;Space-Punk;"I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time. My best friend of 12 years was the one person I truly felt connected to. We were more like soul mates, we called ourselves siblings, it was more than a friendship she was truly my sister. I was having a particularly dark day, really didn't want to be here, and while we were talking I basically said something along the lines of ""You, my mom, and my cat are the only things holding me here. Sometimes I wish you'd all just drop dead so I would be able to kill myself without guilt."" It wasn’t something I really meant, and she knew that. She didn't take it personal or even really acknowledge it, I know she knew I didn't actually want her to die because that was the last thing I wanted. I couldn't have imagined my life without her. She was my rock, my safety net, the one person I told everything to. We planned to get a house and grow old together.That same night she passed away. Completely unexpected, not intentional. Her mom told me the coroner's said she went fast, probably didn't even realize it was happening. God I hope that's true.Now, along with my grief, I feel so fucking guilty. I can't believe I said that and then it happened. It feels like it's my fault, like I willed it into being through my words alone. I want nothing more than to follow her, but I still have my mom and my cat to think about, plus I know she wouldn’t want me to die she literally told me so during that final conversation. So I'm forcing myself to carry on for her, but now I have so much anxiety that my mom and cat are gonna go too. Like the universe will punish me for saying it. I'm terrified that I'm about to lose everything that matters to me and I'll only have myself to blame. I hate myself so fucking much. I can't get it out of my head, and I can't stop panicking that my mom is next. That's my biggest fear in all my life, and now I'm worrying that I'm manifesting it by thinking about it on loop. Is there any way I can learn to forgive myself and accept it wasn't my fault? And that my mom and cat aren't just gonna keel over because of my stupid words? I'm so so scared.

1c6tug4;One week left. No one else to tell.;No-Weather173;I’m 19. I’ve been planning this for a few months. My family thinks that I’m doing well in university, soon to be in third year, but everything is a lie. I’ve failed two years straight. I’ve already been kicked out once, and this’ll be the last time. I didn’t intend for it to be this way, but I have an incurable odor condition, and I’ve been bullied most of my life because of it. I can’t attend classes, talk to anyone, stand/sit near people, or go into small rooms, and even after living most of my life like this, it’s still too much to bear. At first I started out fine when I pushed through it with the motivation from starting university, but then I started skipping classes. Most of them were cramped with tons of students, and people were always forced to sit next to me, I just couldn’t deal with it anymore after a while.I usually hid after being around people for too long, I did so in the washrooms, hours and hours every day. Then I just stopped bothering going to campus at all, since I couldn’t go anywhere or even walk between classes without having a panic attack due to all the students. Now I just smoke weed/do drugs in hidden spots in nature all day.I’ll never be able to work a normal job or even use the degree I’m trying to study for anyway, there really isn’t a point in even trying. I know exactly what’s going to happen. This might seem trivial to others, but I have a lot of mental health problems because of my smell.I think I have adhd too, but I’ve canceled the tests and all my doctors/pscyhiatrist appointments, since I won’t be going anyway. I can hardly handle being in the room with the doctor. I have no friends, extreme social anxiety, no work ethic or motivation at all, and I’m very ugly, which I was bullied for too. I can probably fix some of my problems, but this is already years overdue. I don’t have anything left in me for another month, year, or anything else after the 24th.It really isn’t about the academics, but everything that caused it.  I’m the only one in my family like this. Everyone else is doing great at life, has plenty of friends, gfs/bfs/spouses, but I’m the only one that’s completely alone. My family makes fun of me for it. Honestly my whole life has been embarrassment.I probably could tell my parents all of this, I know they’d give me another chance. but I’m not going to try again. I can’t be like everyone else, I’ve always known this, I just didn’t have it in me to end my life before.I’m a coward, so I know I won’t be able to do it sober. I’ve been experimenting with some drug combos the past few weeks, and I’m going to take one that I know will help me commit. I’m going to take 100 apple seeds and finely grind them, then eat it all shortly before I jump off an overpass in Toronto. I’ll get serotonin syndrome too, so that should help.;I’m 19.

1c6tn6b;Everybody talks over me and don't really care about what I say.;One_Description8845;"I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts recently, primarily because of my apparent unawareness of my lack of social skills.I've always been the silent guy in every class, usually people approach me, not the other way around, but I never really thought about how bad I'm at expressing what I want to say.I do have friends tho, like 3 different friend circles actually, I really adore alot of them and consider them very close to me, however, I've always feel like people talk over me or don't really pay attention to what I'm saying. Sometimes I'm telling them a story about something that happened to me and they just don't even respond or directly start talking between them about some unrelated topic, I sometimes stop talking to see if they ask me about what I was telling them and it never happens.I also struggle with the perception that people have sometimes over what I say, sometimes I respond to whatever somebody asked me and they tell me I was rude or toxic and I just stand there thinking ""what the fuck did I just say?"" Because in my mind I wasn't being rude at all and I responded something very normal and mundane.I know I'm the problem, it's not an isolated issue with just one group of friends, it's everybody in my life, so I know for sure I'm the problem.I feel like I'm not really bringing anything good or interesting for anybody, I sometimes even feel like some of my loved one's problems would disappear if I straight up died (or never even existed) like my girl best friend who, and I know this for a fact, feels like she can't get a boyfriend because she's kindda stuck with me but also can't be far from each other for very long because we've known each other for so long that it feels weird being apart. Or my mother, who struggles with marital problems with her husband because he can't stand me (and don't get me wrong, he's a great man that I admire and took care of me and my sister, it's just me that is the problem)And I know this sounds like some edgy shit a 15yo would say, but I'm 23 and I'm really not trying to play victim, I'm talking as objectively as I can.On a side note, just so you have a little more context about my life in case you want to form an opinion, I'm a pretty decent looking guy, athletic, I have a pretty good job and I just finished a degree in finances and i never had problems with getting on romantic relationships. (These are usually related to low self esteem and bad mental health).I have what alot of people would think it's a great life that nobody should feel bad about, however I struggle alot with my looks, I'm never satisfied and I feel like I look worse than I did before hitting the gym (even tho it's objectively not true, I can't help but feel like this) I feel like my career is not that good and I should've taken an engineering path and my job it's pretty static (anybody rarely gets promoted even tho the initial pay it's pretty good for a 23yo) and, as previously stated, I feel like I don't bring anything good for anybody and maybe I did at some point but I've fulfilled my purpose in these people's lifes and now I'm just kindda like a burden.I've felt like this for like a year or two, never really had suicidal thoughts until now because I've tried everything to be a better person including therapy, apparently nothing really worked because I keep having the same problems.The catalyst for this whole Bible I just wrote? Yesterday I was hanging out with some friends including my girl best friend, and we were playing a board game, at some point I did something normal that was completely appealing to the rules of the game, and everybody started calling me a cheater, it was so stupid and I was so sure it wasn't against the rules that I initially thought they're were joking but they were actually getting mad at me and started yelling and wouldn't let me explain so I just stood up and left. Later I found a video explaining the rule and showing that I was right and sent it to the group chat, I even apologized for leaving and acting inmature, guess what? Not a soul addressed my massages and they started talking about something unrelated later that night like I didn't even send anything.Ik its a stupid problem, but It was the droplet that spilled the water.It's not like I'm planning to kill myself yet, but I really wouldn't mind if get a hearth attack while asleep.I'm just venting, you're welcome to tell me what do you think of this situation.

1c6tgwx;My Love wants to go from me;Throwaway-34875832-d;This is all so complicated. My best friend and I know each other for 4 years now. We started getting close when she suffered a medical condition which affected her nervous system in her lower legs last August, 8 moths ago. Since then she is in need of a wheelchair and i started helping her. At first i was only bringing her to some doctors appointments but after a while we developed a deep connection and intese friendship. The disease is curable with the right treatment, but through her early childhood trauma and many other mental illnesses that she has, she was never able to bring herself to get the right treatment. After a while she even used the pain from her medical condition as a way to inflict herself pain by not taking pain meds and going outside during Winter where she dissociated and became unconscious by the pain. All to not feel the emotional pain anymore. The Situation worsened and her boyfriend couldn't handle her anymore and decided to distance himself from the situation because he couldn't handle the emotional pain she inflicted to the people surrounding her by harming herself. I kept supporting her through every step and didn't manage to study anymore. 1,5 months ago, at the beginning of March after an emotional outburst by her boyfriend in the middle of the night she fled the house and drove in a dissociative state through half of the city in her wheelchair. I followed her. When she came to herself we got back to their apartment and went to sleep. After waking up I could feel she was emotionally in huge pain. She suddenly escaped into the bathroom, shut herself in and starting cutting herself. Meanwhile I was frantically trying to open the door, while I hear her crying and repeatedly cutting herself. I managed to crack the door with an Allen wrench 30 seconds later. There was blood on the floor but she was nowhere to be seen. The window was open. I sprinted to the window in panic. She was still outside ready to jump. I got to her and held her while her feet were already dangling over nothing. With the help of her boyfriend we managed to get her up and the rescue squad came soon after. Since then she got an additional Trauma from that day and from the psych ward, where she was released only 1 day later (don't ask me how). After that she distanced herself from her boyfriend because of all the emotional pain he caused her. I stayed by her side. From that day on she stopped eating. At first it was a mechanism of control to her, but after a while it turned into her wanting to die by not consuming any calories anymore. We started living at her mothers. We grew ever more attached and we both already confessed to arising feelings for eachother. She told me many times that I am the only thing conflicting with her decision to die. Her body started deteriorating. She told me many times that she is thinking about cutting me off to get through with her decision and to protect me from having to watch her slowly deteriorate further. Yesterday was the day she cut me off. I went back to my apartment. I haven't slept in 27 hours. I am currently drinking. I've cried the last 4 hours. I want to be by her side, even if it means watching her die. At least I would be by her side in her last Moments. She won't let me. I can't bear not being by her side. I've tried everything, but anything just brings her more pain. I feel like shit. Many things I didn't write because it would get too long and too complicated but I think you get the gist if you managed to get this far. I am still writing her even if she barely answers, and if she answers it's to say goodbye. Her mother still wants to try some things, but my best friend ,whom I realised I love, doesn't have much time left. She hasn't eaten anything besides drinking Milk in 7 weeks now and is not even drinking Milk anymore, just Tea. Our last Moment together felt forced. I won't be able to forgive myself if it was the last time I saw her. I will be trying everything to be by her side whatever happens, but currently I just feel pain and fear of never seeing her again. I had to get my emotions out somewhere. Thank you for anyone reading.;This is all so complicated. My best friend and I know each other for 4 years now.

I’m a resilient person and I’ve done so much to take myself out of it. But now I’m being cut off from all my friends and I don’t know why, maybe they’re in an upper echelon than me bc I went to their college but grew up so poor and now that we’re 5 years out I’m not cool anymore to be friends with? And have been doing everything to get myself in a good financial spot but my current partner makes me feel so bad about myself all the time and I do so much for them and I was crying yesterday (I hide my feelings like so much bc I don’t want to put them on anyone else, so I was being vulnerable) and they said they couldn’t deal with it bc they were high and I haven’t heard from them since. Reached out to the friends who have cut me off for no reason and no response. Said I was sorry if I did anything wrong and I love them.  Not sure what to do anymore, constantly trying to be there for everyone and do the most for everyone and no one cares what happens to me Using vague terms bc these ppl are redditors I am so tired of being hurt.

1c6t15b;Every one thinks things will be better down the line. Maybe so. But I know I will hate myself all the same. What little hope I have its dwindles more and more. Why should I continue to suffer for what?;SongIndependent2439;I posted this is a different support type group on Reddit and got one response 'to go therapy'. I've been in therapy for years. Basically, I think everyone doesn't like me, I cant start a conversation with someone at the gym bc I'm so stuck in my head and think they think I'm some creep. This is every day. I've reached out to suicide hotlines twice in the past two months and its honestly a joke. Every day is so hard dealing with all this day after day...I don't own a gun and am too scared to try and kill myself but if there was an accident or I was hit by a car, ect..I would  welcome it. Its a shame these accidents happen to good people who probably would go on and have a happy life. Meanwhile, I could have taken that person's place. It is cruel. I never really had an opporunity for a 'normal' life from the start- when I was a child I was a victim of physical abuse. I didn't learn about what it was until later in life. If I didn't wake up tomorrow I would be more grateful than anything.   Hi, it has been many years since my last relationship. My last two were while I was actively using drugs which the relationship stemmed from. I am in recovery now for some time. During the ten years (in my 20s) I feel like I lost a lot of the mental development and growth ie emotional growth...I think I'm an OK person, overall. I'm not really attractive, more average than anything. Because I've been alone for so long its incredibly hard to make first contact with someone. I do yoga- I'm in a room with 20+ well fit and mostly very attractive women almost each day so there's plenty of opportunities. Yet, doing so in so hard. I've tried several dating site online, but nothing ever came up. I suffer from severe anxiety (history of panic attacks) especially social anxiety. I was the victim of child abuse, physical/emotional, until I was old enough to fight back- and so I think a lot of the anxiety is a result of that. I'm honestly stuck in a perpetual self-fulfilling prophecy of pretty much hating myself due to self-doubt and really not liking myself. Overtime, I begin to then believe these thoughts...I cont to try and work on myself ie yoga- At the end of the day, I am incredibly lonely and don't even really remember what a true connection with someone is like on a romantic level. I am 37 and pretty much everyone I grew up with is married and/or has children. I can't help but feel like 'wtf is wrong with me'? IDK if anyone here is or has had similar thoughts/issues in this regard, but I am open for anything. I am just so tired of being alone.

1c6sd9s;Not sure what to do, but contemplating what feels inevitable. ;sadclowntherapy;I've been isolating myself from my friends and family for months, rather successfully for the most part besides my ex that's very attentive. I'm a very secluded person naturally already so I guess nobody really sees it that weird. I've had a few check ins but there's not much someone can do besides ask. In general I've always preferred keeping things to myself until I couldn't. Last year I overdosed and it upset so many people, I felt so guilty and crushed and not human during the whole process. Basically the emergency service people were jerks about it and my time in the hospital wasn't good at all. (I literally was ignored for an entire day in the ER cause of an error with the nurses while they were supposed to be monitoring my blood levels??) And I've never had a good time at a mental hospital. At the time I hadn't truly even wanted to kill myself, I just wanted to hurt myself bad I guess. I dunno, I wanted a drastic event to happen. I've been told that suicidal ideation is a lotta the times just formed because someone's stuck and they want major change, like an extreme escape route. So whenever I feel particularly suicidal I always tried to make a change or figure out a way to feel slightly less unstuck. But to be honest since I was 14 (I'm 21 now)  I've planned to die. I haven't had any goals or aspirations, I decided a very long time ago that I'd be dying young as a statistic. The only things that have really prevented me from further pursuing that was the people around me. But I hate that, I feel so empty and inhuman. I feel like I've never been a person, at least not for a very very long time. And that I'm just pretending to be one. I can't and don't feel comfortable speaking about this to anyone, my loved ones only make me feel anxious and on edge when they ask me about my well being. I don't like making them feel bad, and when I do I spiral. Inadequate, I feel so unworthy of flesh. I feel like I don't know who I am because, that I only exist in the context of other people and things. Im terrified of the world around me and it makes me want to just shrivel up. I don't know what to do anymore, reaching out to others feels useless, the same song and dance I've gone through since I was 14. Ive never been able to grow or heal, I feel stuck inside myself, and the only way it feels like that I can truly be freed is to no longer be inside of me. I wish I was a tree or a bug, something without complexity that never has to question it's worth or existence. I try to live like them when I'm upset, sit outside in the sun and take it in till Im too hot, simple pleasures and stuff. But it never lasts. I don't know what my intent here really is, I guess just to air some of my grievances. Maybe test run to see how it feels to tell someone how I'm feeling for once. But uh, if you did read all this thanks for that.

1c6s2qp;Feel like I’m still where i was at ;TrynnaChief;Hello to whomever takes the time out their day to listen or feel like reading . I’m 22 so i know I’m young, These past two years have been the literal worst of my life. I got into a dui accident July 11th 2022 , thankfully nobody else was injured or involved other than myself . I went through the windshield and broke my back in three spots . Extremely lucky to be alive and coherent. Instead of not drinking anymore i spiraled further into it . Last year i went to rehab in March due to alcohol, once i got out i stayed sober for about a month and due to the girl i put my sobriety into leaving i spiraled further . Worked here and there ya know to say i had a job for my parents and to fund my alcohol and weed . Well due to me not caring i put myself into around 3 k worth of credit card debt. Got a better job making double the amount i was making, then got drunk on the job last thanksgiving . My mother and aunt pick me up to take me to the family dinner and im already fucking blacked out getting put into the car by coworkers. I wake up and cause a huge scene at thanksgiving . I have a conscious so i know when i fucked up something like a gut feeling , i woke up the next day and knew i had to due something or my entire family would be done with me . I checked back into rehab . This time around im doing “GREAT!” As everyone around me likes to say . I feel more alone than ever.  I’ve lost all my friends , my parents are constantly berating me about my issues i have to solve. i give them the same answer and it’s just money and I’m trying to fix the two years of fuck ups . Yes i know their my issues and it’s up to me to fix them and i put myself in this situation i completely understand. I just don’t understand why the only thing my parents seem to care about is just me not drinking. They don’t give me any answers or any advice . They just jump down my throat about why i don’t have a car yet or why i havnt moved out yet  Or what i should be doing with my life and where they were at when they were 22 . The only time i have a genuine conversation with either of them is bs politics with my stepdad and weed with my mom and the occasional “how many days” . It feels easier to just go off somewhere to never be found again but as I’ve wrote this my younger sister has come in twice to show me tik toks . I had to hold back tears each time because she doesn’t deserve to have the same traumas as me . I’m just lost and feel like there’s only one answer .Sorry for the long post;Hello to whomever takes the time out their day to listen or feel like reading .

1c6rn2j;It’s getting really difficult to ignore these urges;SocialLifeIssues;I’ve thought about suicide everyday for the past month, and on and off for the past several years, but I keep telling myself give it a month, or give it until I do XYZ just in case. Sometimes I achieve those things, sometimes I don’t, but it’s generally my only motivator for living, the hope that somehow things will get better if I give it just a little bit longer, but the thing is they never do, or if they do, it never lasts. Everything good that comes to me vanishes almost as quickly as it came, and I’m always left a depressed mess just trying to keep going. It’s like I’m never enough for anybody, and never good enough for anything, and the things I am good at just don’t really provide much pleasure and are more of a burden. The only thing that ever seems to rid me of all of these feelings is love, but love just doesn’t seem to last in my partners no matter what I do. It hurts, and it’s a painful cycle that I’ve grown all too accustomed to. Oh, and the worst part is, I’m extremely neurodivergent, and even though it is not debilitating, people always note that I’m cool but one of the strangest or craziest people they have ever met, and my interpretation of things is almost always completely different from those made by the neurotypical. It’s just it feels so degrading to always be seen as everything that society wants in person, and to be doing everything right, but still being rejected for it. I just don’t think it’s going to get better, and my vices only get worse- alcohol, smoking, and whatever other drug I can get just to reach that high for an evening.

1c6rcec;I want to see the other side and be free of the burden of this world;AdFluffy7980;"This is my first post here. I've been in a rough state for years now, contemplating ending it from time to time but ultimately letting it go. Recently however it's the only thing on my mind. My childhood was the only pleasant time of my life, everything was so simple back then, I had friends and my mom. When I was 11 she passed away due to cancer. I am bastard child, my father was rarely around me and when we actually were together he used to go for a drink every time. After the passing of my mom I was ""raised"" by my uncle and brother. It wasn't really raising, I had food and shelter and I am extremely grateful to them for that but there was no parental love, I didn't really have anyone to teach me basic things, no one to look up to. To cope with my mother's death I got into video games and ultimately it turned into addiction that exist to this day. With free and almost unlimited access to computer, porn addiction appeared that also exist to this day. When I graduated from middle school I got separated from my two childhood friends, the only ones I've ever had. I was always a shy guy, not wanting to cause any problems I used to seclude myself from groups during my school days. I've never had any enemies, I was never in a fight but I also barely had anyone to talk to. I pursued the wrong direction in high-school, I went to IT school but I've never had any interest in the subjects discussed here, I just wanted to play games. I used to play League and was really good at it to the point where my only dream ever was to become a professional player. In the end it didn't work and from that point on I was living without purpose, wasting money on things that I don't need to get that sliver of happiness, wasting time on doing the same meaningless things day after day. Some time after high-school I went to university for English philology combined with some tech stuff. I don't know why I did it. Probably to postpone my adulting even further, I never wanted to grow up. I realized that I had no skills whatsoever that will help me survive through all of this. 3 years passed, somehow I'm still alive. Last semester of university was about to being and I've decided to drop out. I couldn't handle the stress anymore and saw no future in all of this, honestly I haven't seen any future for about 10 years now. I've managed to find a girlfriend or rather she found me but all good things must come to the end and we are on the verge of breaking up.Here we are today, I am expected to find a job soon but nothing really interest me, not to mention I have no skills besides being able to speak English relatively well and use computer. I don't have any friends to go out with or talk to for couple of years now. Gaming has been a chore for a long time.  I feel really emotionless, nothing really gets me excited anymore, happy or sad. Couple of members of my family that I used to have contact with during my childhood passed away recently and I felt nothing, just emptiness. My family got really small, it was never big in the first place but we are down to few people. Spending time with my girlfriend was the only escape from all of this but as I mentioned before we are on the verge of breaking up due to my mental condition. She has her own problems I don't want to bother her anymore. I feel like a burden to my brother and uncle. I want my brother to start a family but with me by his side it probably will never be possible for him. Last thing I wanna say is that I'm not afraid of death, I believe there is something on the other side and I want to see what it is. I am certain nothing good awaits me in the future, just more pain of existing. I think this is the best moment to end it all.";This is my first post here.

I am not scared of death at all I just don’t want my girlfriend to be sad about it as I know she would blame herself and she is literally the best girlfriend ever.That’s what I think is crazy about it, I don’t feel like I should be having suicidal thoughts, i have the best and most caring girlfriend of 2.5years but we have been best friends since we were about 9. I have plenty of friends, a supportive family. I just don’t see the point of life I hate the idea of it I don’t look forward to anything in the future. I feel as though I’ve tried everything I can to make life good but I always mess it up in the end. I also feel like my mind has deteriorated I can’t remember information and I struggle to remember names of even close friends, my short term memory is non existent I don’t know how to fix it or if I can.But at this point I am just waiting to die, I am doing everything I can to speed it up, my arms and hands are complete messes with cuts and scars, I sleep a solid 4 hours a day caused probably because I drink easily 6 monsters a day I go through over 90 pints a week (not exaggerating me and my mates counted my bank transactions over the past year and that’s the average). I smoke on and off depending on funds. Only thing I don’t do daily is drugs because of funds but also much of my family are police because i reckon I would be caught fast even though I don’t live at home.I worry that I have messed up my uni degree now too I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do, do I just keep waiting for it to get better?

1c6qmo7;I need help;Legitimate-Bit8195;So for a while now I’ve been feeling “numb”, I don’t feel sadness or happiness just anger. Every night I have these “episodes” where all I can think about is ending, thinking about how no one actually cares for me but my family and to me just my family caring isn’t enough (yes I know people have bigger issues) I have friends but I know for a fact that they wouldn’t care. I constantly feel lonely as if I have no one. I have had anxiety issues before also (I did counciling/ therapy for 2 years and it didn’t help) I feel really tired all the time to the point I don’t wanna get out of bed because nothing that I do is worth it, but as time goes on the more I believe that ending it all is the way to go. I feel hurt and I just can’t do it anymore. I’ve spoken to a friend as well and he suggested to talk to my parents so I did, it was awkward and it didn’t help much, so he suggested callin the helpline, I rang them I was in the phone for an hour and they said all they can suggest is the doctors. Now I go to the doctors often for physical issues and I just feel like making another appointment is pointless because I believe that they will just see that what I’m doing is for attention. But anyway I’ve done research on committing and the ways don’t seem like they could actually kill u, for example 10 spoons of salt with warm water, I just want suggestions in my situation and I also wanna know a way to go without any pain that involves a weapon.;So for a while now I’ve been feeling “numb”, I don’t feel sadness or happiness just anger.

I can distract myself sometimes until I remember that I am all alone truly. It hurts so much. I hate it. I hate myself more than anything but now that they have left it really makes me understand that I was the problem. I wish I was better to the people who made my life worth living. Now I only have the people forced to love me. Why doesn’t anyone truly love me? Why isn’t anyone on my side. I am so alone it hurts.

I am the real problem and I know it. I am fat I am ugly and I know it. It doesn’t need to be sugarcoated because it is a fact. Just like how I know that I am just so unlovable. I want men to want me I want to feel desired I want to feel listed after but also I just want someone to cherish me and care about me and protect me from my self hatred.

1c6qgat;Just wrote down a suicide note;ThatOneKyouka;(This is just venting, it's whatever)I've been struggling with a few things over the course of the last couple of years, including among them as the fact that I'm posting it in this subreddit would imply- Suicidal thoughts. They never got to the point of me actually committing into performing the act itself, just sort of something in the background, luring in any time something like my gender dysphoria, self worth or a different thing managed to get me back into feeling down.  But, over time, those moments started to pile up, forming a bit of a clear plan in my head, even if it isn't fool proof. Simply going up to the roof in the building I live in, which should probably be enough to kill me if I fell in the right angle- Jumping, and boom, done-  I even got myself to check whether or not there'd be someone up there for the time I decided to actually do it.  Nonetheless, that leads to the point of the title of this post. After arriving home, I settled down on my desk, and wrote more of a letter towards someone, expressing a few things that I have told them- and a few that I haven't, but regardless, its contents didn't change what it was, a suicide note.  And in all honesty? The fact that I wrote it down and have an idea on what else I'd like to write scares me a little-  It's not that I necessarily want to die, I just, I just don't want to deal with everything else, especially myself.;(This is just venting, it's whatever)I've been struggling with a few things over the course of the l;;1;2;2024-04-18 00:54:38;2024-04-18;Thursday;00:54:38;1406;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:56.970854

My father took me in out of obligation. We speak sometime but he rarely answers me. I have family but they do not like me. I don’t like me. All I have is my dog and she is old and will die soon. I think more and more as to why I am going through the motions of life. Why do I go to therapy? I know it does not help. Why do I take medication? I know it does not help. I am no fool, I know that life does not get “better”. I know that there is no true good or bad, everything is perception. Yet the lens which I view life is smudged and I can’t clear it. I see no point in living and don’t think I ever did. I think a lot of how sure I was when I tried to hang myself. I had never felt so sure of anything in my life. Nothing had ever felt so right. I don’t think that humans have some sort of greater purpose in life. You live and then you die. We are born dying. Why should I wait. I keep asking myself and can’t come up with an answer. I am unloveable, stupid in every sense of the word, objectively ugly, a burden on those around me, and ultimately unfixable. Maybe there is something in my brain but probably not. I am not special. I think instead that I am a prefect culmination of all things humans find repulsive. This is the only way in which I can be considered perfect. I am going to die eventually, and I believe it should be soon.;I don’t know why I keep living. I’ve had suicidal thoughts since age 8. First attempted at age 12.

1c6pekb;I want everyone to feel guilt.;acadcia;I want everyone to feel guilt. My parents, peers, etc. have all factored into the reasons I feel like doing what I’ve been thinking of doing.      I get scared sometimes of being gone, I feel like I haven’t done enough as I’m still young (17F).     However, I feel elated with knowing that everyone would hopefully feel guilt, sorrow, or sadness thinking about my outcome. The thought consumes me sometimes. I honestly don’t know if it’s because of the fact they’ll care enough about me or what. I think about how they’ll all cry and think of the memories we shared with one another.     I also get scared that no one will care, they’ll forget me and won’t be as sad as I thought. That they’ll move on like I never existed. I don’t exactly know if I want to leave yet, but I do enjoy the fantasy of those who will suffer from my choices as a final stamp of guilt.     I want my parents to feel guilt for being my first bullies and picking me apart. I want my ex-friends to feel guilty for betraying me for temporary happiness. I want everyone that’s done me wrong to be sad that they weren’t treating me as well as I treated them.     I’m so sad that I’m sad and everyone’s happy, I’m so sad that the people who hurt me are happier than me. I’m not happy, not at all.     As I take a deep breath, I’m not sure if it’s my end exactly that I want or help and comfort.     I don’t know, sorry. I feel so dumb idk.;I want everyone to feel guilt.

I have everything going for me. About to be married, 6 figure job, supportive friends and family. Yet, I am still so so sad. I’m not even sure why but I am just filled with sadness and a feeling of giving up. I take 60mg Prozac everyday for anxiety and depression but the past 6 months I feel like I did before I started taking meds. My friends and family love and support me, yet I just can’t do life anymore. Things that used to make me happy don’t anymore. All I want to do is stay in bed because sleeping is the only time I don’t have to deal with life. Again, I don’t think I am going to kill myself but the thought of doing it is seemingly seared into my brain. I just hear a voice in my head constantly saying “kill yourself” “no one loves you” “you’re a piece of shit”. I know none of this is true but physically I feel depressed. I dont know what to do. I truly do not want to be around anymore and find everyday such a struggle. No one in my life fully understands how I feel and I have never felt so alone while being surrounded by others. I have no reason to but I hate my life, I hate myself, and I truly think the world would not even be different if I were dead. Yes people would be sad for a bit but they would get over it. My life is meaningless and I’m struggling to see the point in continuing.;I’m going to preface this by saying I am not going to actually kill myself.

1c6oddw;I can’t do this anymore.;Sharkisha24;I’m tired. I’m tired of being tired. I’m 18, my ENTIRE life I’ve been tracked and not able to go places or do things by myself. I was always heavily helped or influenced by my parents into what I should or should not do. I’ve basically never had a single decision that was my own. This has lead to me being an over spender and an impulse buyer along with things like hoarding. I can’t do it anymore. My entire life wasn’t mine. I’ve missed so many experiences. I’ve lost so much. My whole childhood I acted like an adult and now that I am an adult I realize that I didn’t have a childhood. I can’t get that back and there’s nothing I can do about it. I’ve told my parents but they don’t listen. My Dad is basically like,” he’s a boy just let him do what he wants to do at the moment and let him experience things and fail and stuff” and my Mom is the complete opposite. I like the thought of me not being around. I like the thought of me ceasing to exist. It makes me happy to think of all of the ways I can just stop living. I wish and I hope and I dream that something will happen like an accident so that I don’t have to be the one to do it but it still gets done. I don’t see myself dying of natural causes. It’s actually crazy for me to think that I’d die of natural causes. It makes me happy thinking of how everyone around me would react to me being dead. I get that that’s fucked up but I’m so low at this point. The only thing keeping me safe and alive right now is my 8 year old dog. I think that when he dies I’m going to snap. I just can’t. I can’t live like this anymore. I’ve heard all of it. “ once you go to college it’ll be better” “ it gets better you just have to wait” nothing means anything anymore I don’t feel Love. I never have. I don’t feel love towards my family members, sure I’m grateful for them but I don’t feel love towards anyone or anything. The only thing I have great affection for is my dog. Which sounds terrible but it’s a chemical thing in my brain, something is wrong and nothing can fix it. If there IS something that can fix it I haven’t found it yet. I want to kill myself. I want to end it all right now but I can’t. I’m too much of a pussy. I have Erectile Dysfunction so I can’t even properly do what I was put on this earth to do: pro-create.

1c6nubo;I've been suicidally lonely for the past three years, I'm waiting for my old dog to die so that I can die with her.;Ghozez430;"From the end of 2019 to the end of 2021 I lived in a college town, it was the only time in my life that I fit in. The second I got a job there I met 5 friends and multiple acquaintances, there were so many interesting people and just people I could talk to. For the last three months I was there was a woman who worked with me and she would spend all of her breaks talking with me. She flirted with me and it was genuine, it was the first time in my life someone displayed romantic interest in me and they weren't just trying to use me for something. When I was in this place I consistently hit the gym, I was the healthiest I've ever been, I stopped taking my anti depressants because I genuinely didn't need them while I was there. Unfortunately I won't be able to go back for a very long time if ever because of the financial hole I dug myself in due to the loneliness and depression making me manic At the end of 2021 I got told I was getting my dog back.  I couldn't afford her on a cart pusher budget so I took an opportunity but it meant moving back to the hellhole I grew up in as a teenager. When I was a teenager here I had a large friend group just to find out that almost all of them were stealing from me and my mom for drug money, I had multiple girls display romantic interest in me just to find out they were stealing from me or using me to try to cheat on their boyfriends, I had 4 friends who rotted their brains or became toxic people due to drug use, 5 if you count my dad.Now I'm back here from the end of 2021 to today and I'm more alone than I've ever been. All of my coworkers conversations revolve around them desperately needing validation for their fragile masculinity. ""I fucked 37 trillion women last night"" ""I bench 40 gorillion tons"" ""I could beat this guy's ass"" ""I could beat that guy's ass"" if it's not one of these topics it's sports ball, gambling, or drugs. These are grown middle aged men with children but they still act like highschool jocks. In the middle of 2023 a woman on the job was fake flirting with me then making fun of me when she thought I wouldn't notice, I went along with it because it was the first time in a long time someone gave me attention.I have a mother figure who keeps trying to get me to talk to people here even though I've tried and failed my entire life living here. She keeps telling me ""You don't have to have everything in common or even much in common with someone to talk to them"" but what she seemingly can't get is that I have nothing in common with the people who live here. No one here spent their childhood watching adult swim shows like Venture Bros or Aqua Teen Hunger Force or Moral Orel, no one here has read books like I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream or Destination Void or Who Goes There, no one here knows the difference between Doom Metal and Orchestral Death metal, no one here has heard of bands like Fit For An Autopsy or Septic Flesh, no one here has seen There Will Be Blood, or The Master, or Dog soldiers. No one here knows what a character action game is, no one here has played Blood or XCOM or postal or og Fallout or the darkness or Dead Rising. No one here would care to here me endlessly prattle about my obsession with the Yakuza games. No one here has read Berserk or Fist Of The North Star, no one here has watched hours long video essays. No here is chronically online, no here is chronically online enough to have heard about the drama around Mayhem and Varg, no one here has heard of my favorite podcast Deep Fat Fried. No one here shares my political or philosophical views.

1c6norm;I feel so exhausted and bad;KsmIDENS;Hello, I'm trying to get your pity or anything, I just feel hopeless and want to talk instead of blow up and attempt suicide again. I work and study and I know most people do that but what I do not get is how you guys do it? I have 4 days college and 5 days work. My work day off is where i spent the most in college and my college off days its where i spend my 12 hour shifts in work. and the free time between all of this is supposedly my study time because finals are next month. so no sleep, no time to rest and even no time to go to place to finish personal things like go to bank to withdraw money or anything! I barely all I do is work and college. and I feel so bad like I want time for me to rest and go outside or even stay home but watch tv shows that I like or do my hobbies and look for my personal things. and the issue is in college summer holiday, I will be free so no excuse for me to make work days less so its like will be more work and no time for me too until we start the new study year and here we go again.I feel so exhausted and burnt out and I got no friends or anyone to talk to/about what I feel and I can't focus on study and I'm scared to fail and work too is stressful and I got some bad work mates who makes me more stressed and even mangers do nothing about it and I can't leave the job. so it's like. I'm wishing daily to be dead, I do not even if I will go to hell.

I nevee thought I'd ever need to post here. I have however seen a lot of people come through for each other because of this group.I got married in Dec 2023 to a man I really love and care for. We had been together six years before that. Our relationship has deteriorated gradually over that time but somehow we still chose to get married in the hope of working through it all. My husband has grown cold and it's like he doesn't care anymore. I do not understand his communication because one moment he says he loves me and cares and the next moment says very unkind things to me. He is away for work so most of this is via calls and messages.I have really tried to fix things and nothing seems to work. I have suggested couples therapy and he said we don't have the money for that we however have some gift money we received at the wedding which he declines to let us use so I don't even know if he is really serious about working things out. I feel so bullied, unloved and unvalued. Everything I do seems to make things worse. I am not sleeping, I'm walking around with so much pain and loneliness I feel like I just want to die. I really don't want to kill myself because I don't think my mother or my sisters would survive it and they have done nothing but love me and support me. My sisters husband is unwell so I can't add my problems to their list of stressors. I just wish I could sleep and not wake up. I wish I could switch off and reboot like a computer and get my parts moving again. I am a doctor and I work crazy hours so I don't even have time to go to therapy effectively.

1c6n51n;I think I'm ready to go, but I'm conflicted and I'd like some help sorting my thoughts.;CompleteAccident4188;Hi everyone, I have been ideating for as long as i can remember, and planning my release for a few years now, just waiting for the right moment. Last night, after a deep conversation with my family, I'm realizing how little I actually contribute and how much better off they'd be if I were gone. My biggest concern though, is the pressure I'd be putting on my fiancée since we just bought a house together. I paid 100% of the down payment and plan to cover 100% of the monthly spends for house related things, and she can cover the rest. We both work well paying jobs and I know she can cover the expenses should she need to, but it'll put immense financial pressure on her. I know once I'm gone, she'll have to navigate selling the home and dealing with her grief. We're supposed to get married in September. My reasons for leaving haven't changed much since undergrad. I've just been suppressing it with work and doing band-aid patching with hobbies and sports. My current job pays well, but my dad is my the founder and my brother is my manager. I try to keep up and impress them, but all of my efforts aren't good enough. I know I'll never really be good enough, and I don't know if that's okay. I've started looking at other jobs and while they'll pay less, i feel like it could be a good way to disconnect work from my familly and have better relationships with them. I'm not really sure though. I think I'm ready to let go, but I'm conflicted because of the pressure I'd be putting on my fiancée. Is this a valid reason not to go? I'm so tired and worn, but I don't want to make her suffer because I don't want to live anymore. I guess this is why they say suicide is selfish, but from my perspective, i don't know if i should keep suppressing my concerns and continue living for other people.   I hope you are all having a wonderful day. I'm sorry for such a long post.;Hi everyone, I have been ideating for as long as i can remember, and planning my release for a few y;;0;1;2024-04-17 22:25:05;2024-04-17;Wednesday;22:25:05;1877;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 09:10:08.625519

1c6n3eb;My mental health is fine until I have to work;miffyandfriends333;The past year or so I've been fairly mentally stable. I left an abusive relationship and am recovering, I recovered from my eating disorder and quit self-harm and drinking. I have friends and hobbies and I know that I am lucky to be where I am currently.I am about to finish my degree and am looking for full time work (I haven't worked for a couple of years since I have been studying) and I am remembering how emotionally taxing it is to have a job. All of my previous jobs have exacerbated my mental illness and resulted in self harm and alcoholim and depression. Now that I am applying for roles I am genuinely terrified for what the future holds. I know that I have to work, and I feel trapped and like the only solution to not work in this capitalist society is to just not be here. I'm sure this is really common and not unique to me. In the past I've self harmed to have an excuse to take the day off work, even in jobs that are technically not that bad. If it were possible I'd self harm consistently to avoid working all together but I know the world doesn't work like that.Looking through job descriptions for souless customer servcie roles and the like and not finding anything I could do that would actually be fulfilling is making me revert back to suicidal ideation. I'm not sure why I'm posting this as I'm not necessarily looking for advice as I know that working a fulltime job sucks for anyone and it's something that we just have to learn to deal with. but helps to vent into the electronic void.;The past year or so I've been fairly mentally stable.

1c6lu69;I hurt my best friend and I hate myself, I dont know what happened.;Secret_Term1215;"novel incomingHey all. I really cant talk about this to anyone without hurting her; so sit down this is a doozey. Needless to say I have not so great mental health, in high school I was in a pretty bad emotionally abusive relationship, I was pretty badly abused and pushed everyone I knew away and was in a pretty much severe depression and severe anxiety for around 6 years, I assumed one day I would sleep it off, and think normal but that never happened. Anyways I get to college and really dont put myself out there to meet anyone else. Come to my senior year and my grades are pretty good, but this is when I meet her, and I think shes gorgeous. I eventually work the effort to talk to her, and we become ok friends for about a week or so. During this time she would always message me and one time we stayed up until 2am in the university rec room just talking. This felt pretty damn good, for once it felt like somebody actually wanted to know about me, during this time she even looked up my house address and parents facebook(ok looking back thats weird), anyways a few days later she says shes going on a trip to visit her BF, I was devastated and cried, she says ""that must be a punch in the balls, you had me mindfucked there for a while though, being in a LDR your always looking for something new etc"" we've talked for quite a while and she never once mentioned a BF, even when I asked about her bio once(this is all on me however, I should of asked, I cried for other unhappy personal reasons aswell). It should of ended there.But it didnt the next day I ask if she was okay if we were still friends and she says yes, she apologizes for not telling me sooner. We become pretty great friends, eventually we tell each other about pretty personal secrets, I tell her my high school experience, I tell her things I have never told anyone else, she helps me explore some things about me like my sexuality and she reveals she also did not have the greatest high school experience and she has self harm scars, she later tells she SHs since she has a pattern of cheating in relationships; this only makes me feel more like a piece of shit and youll find out later. I genuinely for the first time in my life feel a purely platonic connection with someone. Shes in a LDR with this guy who I dont know(she later says she never brings him up because it makes me sad(should of ended then)), and we begin hanging out quite regularly, I do some things I shouldnt have done at this time, I noticed she vapes so I begin to buy her vapes, and start vaping and smoking, looking back this should not have happened, but I genuinely enjoyed seeing her happy. She used to always say with the vapes ""Now i have a reason to talk to you"", why? why would you need a reason to talk to your friend? It only made me buy them more. Things start getting bad and she even mentions at this point shes likely emotionally cheating with me, which only scares me; that any day any moment any time this person who I genuinely enjoy and is my best friend could realize this and have to cut all contact with me, my mental health becomes absolutely horrendous due to this and this was always a very scary fear I had throughout all this,I even tell her at one point it feels like im on a seesaw and im stuck and have to constantly battle catching feelings and keeping my only close friend. If i really cared about her it should of ended here, but it didnt, I should of stopped it. She begins to touch me, relativelly platonically(?)(Asking to bite me, biting me, rubbing my chest and carresing my arms) and sharing food, at first I sit there and dont touch back; I dont want to hurt her. Why would I hurt someone I care about? After a while I call her out on this and say like why are you touching me, I really cant touch back she says something along the lines of ""I think im using you as a replacement for the lack of attention in a LDR"", she later says she thought about it and I cant provide that for her, but this continues, what was I doing wrong? Eventually I convince myself its platonic and I touch back with the same things the arm on the shoulder, the shoulder rubbing etc. We would have smokes together every night which would usually be hidden in a stair enclave where we would hug each other etc. One of her responses during this time when I mentioned how bad it would look if somebody saw us doing this she said ""It would be worse for you""?? How would it be worse for someone who is not known to be in a relationship?? My self esteem was the lowest it has ever been in its life, I told myself that perhaps one day things would somehow magically change. Someone finally seemd to really like me?Eventually as you could imagine things escalate, this involves her sitting on my lap(forward facing, saying inapprioate things etc), her letting me rub her thighs and do her hair and rub her feet. I should of cut contact but she was the only person who know me, and understood me. I didnt want to hurt her, I didnt want to hurt myself, but I did both. The big event happens just before Christmas, we go out and we cuddle for a while in the backseat of my car, then we head back, while in the car prior she shows me lewds on her phone(I showed her a lewd of mine prior), then we go out to the pond and were looking in each others eyes holding each other and she asked to kiss my cheek, I say sure, she kisses my cheek and my chin just below my lips, then says ""You know it would still be platonic if I let you kiss me, then I wouldnt actually be kissing you"", I wanted to so very bad, I wanted to with my whole being, I lean in, lean out before eventually saying ""you have a boyfriend, If I kiss you your going to hurt yourself and I dont want to hurt you"", she says ""wow you have more morals than I do"", well I break the fuck down, she says ""I didnt want to kiss you, I love my boyfriend, even if I broke up I wouldnt want to ever date you, you have too much baggage"", ""if we kisses I would block you and stop talking to you"", the person who just asked me to kiss them, the person who has been biting me and touching me for weeks wouldnt even date me? This absolutely destroyed me. I didnt know what to think, anyways this ends with both of us crying, me almost puking and eventually with me consoling her.The next day we go get yogurt and I say shes my best friend and we simply need strong boundaries because I dont want to hurt her. If I should of stopped anytime it should of been now. I buy her a Christmas present and things end ok, breaks go by and im mentally gone, im at the lowest I've ever felt in my life, I feel insane, depressed, just psychotic. She messages and we talk everyday of the break(s), we say how much we miss each other etc, shes my buddy she really is, she knows everything about me, I know alot about her, and shes honestly my best friend, but this was hurting me. Anyways we return from the break into the new semester and I feel like im being used, I feel like a doormat, I feel like dirt. Things escalate here, I help her code, I loved watching her succeed, because shes my friend y'know? Anyways things get pretty bad, and we hang out alot, we always hug and I play with her hair and share our food and were pretty close, at one point I kiss her cheek for a week before realizing thats weird and stop it, there was a week where she would cuddle with me in my bed and I would move her hand from my chest saying stop, she would say how happy I make her and we would rub our faces together and rub our noses together, I would pretty much be repeating ""I dont want to hurt you"", but it made me feel good, how do I navigate this? She would say I was the highlight of her days, the highlight of her semester, how sad she was I graduate soon, how she wishes I was in her grade, how im not a chore to talk to or hangout with. I certainely didnt fully stop these physical actions now because I was selfish, because I was ignorant. She would rub my head as we drove and put her arm down my shirt and while I was driving, etc. She would often also say ""Why havnt you killed me yet...you must hate me etc."" but why would I? Things get super bad here, we head out and I buy her a vape and we have another tough conversation about things, with the usual, ""Im not breaking up with my boyfriend but your so lovable"",I really didnt want to hurt anybody. Anyways I get drunk, she lets me into her room and she sits on my lap again and non-platonic things occured. She cheated; I hurt her. I hurt her bad. I never wanted to hurt her. I never wanted to hurt anybody. The guilt is beyond anything I ever experienced and I cant even understand how she feels. She downplays it, I almost hurt myself bad because of the shame I felt that night, the next day im crying to her and tell her she should probably tell her BF if she really loves him, she says ""ok i will, he will still love me tho"" ""doesnt this scare you? I fuck around"" ""this guy called me cute the other day"" ""you deserve better"" , I then tell her not to tell her BF, because im scared and didnt know what to think to do. I should of not stopped her and walked away then. We stay close friends for around 2 weeks after this event before she realized because of a outside voice that she had to tell her BF, she said her BF broke up with her and she needed space, me being a selfish asshole was unable to do that, I didnt want someone I cared about harming themselves because of me, I wanted to be there for her, I saw her outside and ran up to her, she ran away and she couldnt even look at me. The next day she said that was unacceptable, which it was, and even before that event she didnt see room for friendship since it wasnt ""real"", what does that mean? I still dont understand it, how was it never real? She blocked me, that was 2 months ago and she still avoids me, said she would call the police on me if I approach her again.I tried to apologize, I tried to make amends, I tried to give my closure, I tried to seek closure, All met with disgust, hatred and anger. She literally will sprint away from me full speed as I stand there. I never in my life had someone sprint away from me, I dont know whats wrong with me or why she would think I would hurt her, but I dont blame her. She said she was sorry for her decisions before this and I had little to be sorry for, but how do I have little to be sorry for if im being treated as im a abuser? I should hate her guts, she even said she led me on, she knew how bad that would hurt me, she dangled happiness infront of my face for months, she ruined my senior year, shes filled my brain with pain and resentment and betrayal, she caused me to become ostracized, to become an outcast, I honestly feel forever damaged. but for some reason I still have this deep care for her and I shouldnt, I still hope with all my being she passes and succeeds. I hope shes okay. If she fails or hurt herself over this I dont think I could ever forgive myself. It feels like she trusted me and I betrayed her, but I dont know.Im not a victim, im not a saint, I didnt stop my actions, I played a role and Im forever sorry, I lost someone I cared about and someone who maybe at one point actually cared about me. Im sorry. I dont know how to view this. I just want someone to talk to and someone to understand me, I just want someone to tell me I wasnt blind, for someone to tell me this doesnt define me, for someone to say your going to be okay, because as of now im 2/2 for being hurt badly in a relationship(I dont even know what to call this), any advice I get online I always have to type in ""ex"" to get relevant results which only makes me more confused She couldnt even wish me happy birthday or give me the present she bought me, i spent it all alone. I graduate college in 10 days, I have a ok job lined up, I have a not so great home life, I dont know what to do with myself or how to live with myself after all this, why would I do this to myself, why do I struggle forming connections? why do I hurt people I care about?it felt real to me. Theres more to it perhaps, she used to always say "" i hope im doing him more good than harm etc"" but i dont know how leading someone on who has emotional trauma helps them, maybe we both should of left each other alone. I really did like talking to her, and liked hearing what she had to say, but ill likely never talk or see her ever again. I dont want to go down this road again. I dont want to hurt anybody. I have panic attacks when I go to her hallway or if she sees me I feel like i have to document everything I do, i feel like a weirdo loser. I constantly breakdown. Anytime I try to talk to someone about this im seen as estranged, im disregarded, the only thing I can do is tell my side with proof and videos, but I dont want to hurt anybody anymore; im tired of being hurt.";"novel incomingHey all.

1c6lfz7;Not a Big Fan of Offing Myself But Want Its Benefits?;YoYaBiggs;"Hello everyone,I'd like to open up a discussion about a topic that's been on my mind lately. Are there others out there who, like me, don't necessarily want to commit suicide but simply don't want to be here anymore?I'm talking about not just wanting to disappear off of this planet, but to be somewhere better. For some of us, the thought of not being here anymore holds more appeal than ending our lives. It's not about wanting to die, but rather about seeking an escape from the existential discomfort we may be feeling. It just so happens that we live in a reality where ""suicide"" is the easiest and most common manifestation of this desire. However, it also the worst method to use.Personally, I've found that my main goal in life is to accumulate as much wealth as possible, not for personal gain, but to settle my debts and help others as much as I can. Once I've achieved that, I believe my purpose will be fulfilled, and I won't have any desire to continue existing on this planet.When I've brought up similar thoughts to these (related in one way or another) to other people before, I've been met with questions like, ""Don't you want to experience this or that?"" or ""Don't you want to find someone to experience this with?"" My answer, like that of many of you, is no. I want nothing to do with this planet anymore. That is why I want to do as much as possible to be a good person, help other people as much as possible, and remove all of the weights from my heart. The only way I see this happening is if I cough up a lot of money or offer people my services (I Currently Have Nothing To Offer).I believe there are many of us who feel this way, seeking an alternative means of escaping this existence that doesn't involve resorting to the pathetic, pitiful, and filthy methods that currently exist like drugs, virtual reality, or other vices and we also don't want to commit suicide.And for those who are considering ending their lives, I urge you to consider what  personal goals you want to accomplish before you actually do so. What do you feel like is holding you back? Now, once you've answered that I want you to hold onto that thought. Answer this next, would you still do it if you knew you were guaranteed to go to a worse place? If the unknown seems as bleak as the known, why rush into it? It could literally be this existence but worse times 1 million. Do not take that chance. Try your best to keep standing and if you fall, just take a rest and a break. Just do not do it. It is not worth it, I promise you that. Endure the suck. I cannot promise you that your life will get any better, I am sorry. In fact, it will not get any better for a lot of folks and I have no idea if you, reader, are one of those folks, but trust me, the last thing you want to do is make bad even more worse. See what I mean? It's best we just fulfill as much tasks as possible that our hearts want to do and just wait for an opportunity to leave this earth. MAYBE there is something out there in the cosmos that can help us with that. I do NOT know for sure nor am I claiming it. But just use simple scientific thought. How can you PROVE that you just merely ""stop existing"" after doing yourself in? You can't!So, I want to encourage everyone who resonates with these thoughts to join me in one thing. Let's come together and brainstorm ways to escape this existence other than taking our own lives. Every thought counts, every idea contributes. Instead of fixating solely on suicide, let's explore what else is possible. Let's support each other and find a better path forward. It does not have to be an organized event. Just do it right now, as your are reading this. Just take 5-10 seconds about this. If it peaks your interest then keep it. If not, then you only lost 10 seconds of your day.I love all of you even though this both do not know me and this also sounds like a cliché canned statement. I say ""I love you"" because I have been through so much shit to know how it feels to not be loved. So, as per my existence, I know for a fact that when I say ""I love you"" I am not just pulling a canned statement out of the deepest trenches of my anal cavity.";Hello everyone,I'd like to open up a discussion about a topic that's been on my mind lately.

1c6ldmy;It's all just a bit pathetic and sad ;stewpert5;Dear AllI'm finding everything just really pathetic and really sad. I don't believe I'd go down the route of hurting myself to leave this world. Mainly because as much as I believe it will give me peace - it just seems all to scary to leave.I guess I just don't have the nerve to - which, I mean, it's not the worst trait to have considering the plethora of broken and lost souls posting on this site.It's just difficult.I think I've actually got a grip with the loss of my wife, and, the loss of my daughter. Both to cancer over a three year span. I think with all the hard work I've done to myself, or with myself, I can just about swim the sea of grief. Allowing it to nestle in me without taking the tip and taking myself out of the picture.It's just the pathetic nature of how I'm living. Cleared my debt that I built up last year in the depths of my grim life. Now I'm just trotting along. Waiting for pay day to jump up and allow me to do things like fix my car. Pay rent. Put food in me.Today I couldn't even afford the £19.99 for my sertraline. I didn't fit the quote to get it for free as I'm in work. I mean the tablets took so long to get in to system to finally start working that come tomorrow I'll be resetting my body without them. Than start the journey again on 25th.But it's not even the money side if things that's tiring me out. It's the nature of just plodding and waking up and going 'right- what now.'Least I've been able to secure my job. I mean that's something. But it's just the constant 'I've woken up. What the fk is going to be my drama today.'I used to joke my life was a TV show. And the writers of my show really need to start passing up some joy. I dunno. Maybe I just needed to vent.

AI will most likely take over everything especially creative arts like writing and drawing and there's nothing we can do to stop it. I even got some PTSD of being hit as a pedestrian six months ago and it doesn't feel like it was that long ago. I've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression for several years and even as a teenager.Economy just keeps getting worse and the fact narcissism seems to be on the rise. I keep telling myself this is only temporary. It will get better. It will get easier but it does NOT. I'm so convinced in the next five years the only escape is death and the amount of articles and youtube videos popping up about how bleak the future is.Slowly losing faith in humanity and so many things. I don't even have much of a support system either besides family and a few friends online.I've been trying to get therapy and professional help but the process has been gradual and not quick enough. God I've been trying to do anything that helps in the slightest and not enough to really keep me going . Not even the small little things such as nature or playing pokemon on my phone or my cat.Everything feels stagant to me for the few past years and I feel like it's just gonna keep getting worse especially with real world issues and AI advancing. no one fucking cares. it's probably even too late since the genie is now out of the lamp and the fact it will be used in warfare.It feels like if I kill myself within a few years I feel like it would finally stop the ""inevitable"" that could happen within yearsThe saddest part I reached out to a mutual and they couldn't give me reasons not even one to keep me going and living except small things which feels useless to me. It doesn't help the fact I'm autistic which makes so much stuff harder when it comes to social stuff plus considering the current events too such as struggling to find jobsloneliness has consumed me most of my life and the fact that is just getting worse instead of better. I can't even get my state ID bc of the landlord refusing to provide the lease to provide my residence (they won't even give us mailing service either!) and the lack of money for it so I can't go to places like the bar. I can't find local clubs in my area too. too far away from where I live and can't drive atmIf this is how the world will be within 5 years maybe i just want to get out of it before the brunt of it gets worse.";(F22) I'm so pessimistic about the future.i feel incredibly hopeless and nothing I can do even takin;;0;1;2024-04-17 20:42:03;2024-04-17;Wednesday;20:42:03;2563;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-20 21:09:57.954240

1c6k1d4;Considering Taking my own life.;Videogame-repairguy;I'm an artist and animator from Canada, I am in my mid 20s and I have ADHD and Mild autism. To put it lightly.Lately I've been involved in some AI discourse starting from late 2022, I've had arguments with a couple of Pro-AI users on the subreddit called r/AIWars. Well, long story short. Last year I've given AI a try and I've used what I've drawn to train on this AI model, now someone took the same drawing I made and made a model off it and essentially ripped ownership from me. The user in question won't be named in respect, and for them to not get any drama.However, they continously mock me and belittle me. A few more users in question chimed in and they're only making me feel worst.If AI is normalized beyond legal laws and If someone can take ones drawing or illustration and make a model off that drawing, then they now legally own what I make. I can't bring myself to accepting this new information.Problem is that I can't live in a dystopian future where everything I own and create doesn't belong to me but instead is owned by an AI and the individual who has stolen the image. Or a dystopian future where all jobs are automated and only automated with no input from humans. Humans will be essentially not allowed to work in most professions, UBI won't exist because it will never exist giving the circumstances of our worlds leaders. They won't care.Since artists concerns and worries are constantly being ignored, belittled, mocked, and pushed aside.

1c6jiq4;Waiting for a push;No-Tell8298;"20fBeen fighting depression since I was 13, I was diagnosed with clinical depression at 14, then persistent depressive disorder at 18. My boyfriend of four years broke up with me last month, currently in no contact with two of my sisters who I'm very much closest to in this entire life. Went through the lowest two weeks. I was on the surge, I partied hard, I sold some of my things, cleaned my room, did all my school work to not leave any burden to anyone when I'm gone. I nearly did it, but didn't, obviously. I still have my letters, pills, and the bottle of alcohol I was going to drink to die still in the same place as I placed it when I was about to do it. Right now, honestly, I'm thinking of doing it with a clean cut this time. I'm just waiting for that push. I've tried my best to see myself compatible with the concept of ""living"", but I really can't. I don't think I was meant to be loved, I don't think I'm capable of being loved with everyone around me just tolerating me. Obviously, I can't tell anyone these because I don't want to give them anymore burdens and worries. I want to remembered by them with me laughing, even an ounce of joy. I know when I leave this life, I'm able to do it with no regrets, because I have loved everyone in this life and we, humans, we were only really meant to love, and to be loved, and after doing these, one could feel complete. I am complete. This act of mine would signify that I am finally choosing myself, choosing peace.

1c6ivkf;Depression now just feels numb;FriendshipScary5850;"Im chucking this out there just as a fuck it why not type of thing and to try to wrap my head around what's going on with me. Truth is, at 22, I'm nowhere near where thought I'd be by now.Been battling with depression since was 16. It's been a real rollercoaster, you know? Some days, I'm like, ""Let's end this""' but then chicken out. Weird, right? Can't even tell if it's just how I'm wired or if life's just been hitting me hard from the get-go. But one thing's for sure, I've always had this itch to vanish completely, like off to some deserted island or hiding out in the woods like Walter White. And l'm not picky about how it ends, quick or slow, 'cause deep down, I feel like deserve it. Living feels like a never-ending struggle, yet don't feel like deserve to keep going. I'm so numb these days that I catch myself finding dark humour in my suicidal thoughts. It's messed up, I know, but it's been so long that it's just a part of who am now, shaping every bit of me.I've gotten so used to these thoughts that they're like my default setting. It's like they've become part of my identity, you know? And the thought of not feeling this way scares the hell out of me 'cause it's like, what else have got? No friends, no social life, just me holed up at home for weeks on end. That's been my life for ages now, and I've kinda made peace with it. It's like I'm scared to lose this messed-up part of me that defines who am. Everything I've done has been with this wanna check out"" and ""l'm all alone"" mindset. And hitting 23 soon? That's a wake-up call in itself as I've always had this thought in the back of my head from young that I wouldn't make it passed 24. Usually, l'd be bawling my eyes out thinking like this. But now? Nah, I'm just blank, empty. I'm craving some sort of release, feeling like l'm at the end of my rope. I feel pathetic, like I'm just stumbling through life with no clue where I'm headed.I barely feel like a person anymore. It's been a downward spiral, and can't bring myself to open up about it to anyone. My family's in the dark about it all, and even my girlfriend, bless her heart, only knows bits and pieces 'cause it's tough to deal with these things when you're long distance and honestly recently I feel like I'm just a burden on her and she deserves better. And honestly, I reckon l'd just drain her energy if I let it all out. I doubt anyone gets how deep these thoughts run. Opening up to my parents? That's a can of worms I'm not ready to crack open. And don't even get me started on seeking professional help. That'd slam shut doors l'd never get open again. Graduated uni, but job hunting's been a bust. I thought it'd be my ticket out, a fresh start, but no dice.Sleep's been a joke lately, barely scraping a few hours a night. Always tired, always on the edge of losing it. Ijust want some relief, man. Physically, entally, emotionally, spiritually-I'm just yearning for a way out. I used to be all fit and and cheerful surrounded by mates. Now? I'm just a lonely fat piece of shit and even hitting the gym does bugger all for me. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Feels like this is the end of the road for me.Sorry for rambling on. Just needed to let it all out, you know?

1c6ims7;My mental health is declining and I don’t know what to do;BurglinYaTurts;This is probably going to be really rambly but I’m having a really really hard time right now and I don’t know what to do to make things better.If I had known what my life would become when I was 16 and suicidal I think I probably would’ve gone through with it. I can’t find a job. I’ve been unemployed for a year and a half because I am autistic and really struggling to get through job applications and interviews without having a meltdown.Because of this I can barely afford food, I’m behind on all of my bills, and I’m paralyzed with anxiety because of it. I’ve been trying to get out and DoorDash but I am struggling to even take care of myself right now.I made a new friend which has been really nice to have someone to talk to, but it also comes with this weird new anxiety that I will do something wrong and they will hate me because of it. And not to mention a huge amount of guilt because now I’ve brought this new person into my life that will have to be around in the aftermath of my suicide. I found out recently that my biological family on my dad’s side (he’s adopted) has a history of the women killing themselves bc of abusive relationships and I can’t help but feel like that’s probably where I’m headed. It feels prophetic, it feels like every generation has one woman whose story is just like that, I have a feeling it’s going to be me. Because at a certain point, if I can’t even afford food, what is left to do but slit my wrists and end it? It’s starting to look more and more like that’s my only option. I think the majority of the people I know would probably be better off without me here. I’m a financial burden on most of them, and an emotional burden on the rest. I hate myself so intensely because of this.And I know this is barely relevant compared to everything else I’m dealing with but I feel so disgustingly ugly. I can’t even stand to look at my face or body because it just adds one more thing for me to be sad about.;This is probably going to be really rambly but I’m having a really really hard time right now and I ;;1;3;2024-04-17 19:22:42;2024-04-17;Wednesday;19:22:42;1954;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-19 13:34:13.230338

1c6if2l;I have horrible suicidal thoughts keeping me up at night ;Icy-Essay-8394;I was struggling with postpartum blues right after my pregnancy when my husband decided to drop the bomb and said that he is leaving me for another woman. Being muslims, polygamy is allowed and the only way he won’t proceed with a divorce is if I agree to let him marry the woman. I cannot bear the thought of him having a second wife. And ever since he said this, he has been trying to push me away and hardly talks to me and even if he does, its mostly to hurl insults at me. I wanted my baby girl to have a good family. But I cannot imagine being a single mom at the moment. I cannot live with the fact that my child doesn’t have her father around. My baby is only 2.5 months old. Lately, I have been having suicidal thoughts but the minute I see my daughter, I start crying because she is my everything and I dont want her to grow up with both mom and dad. I cannot imagine my parents or anyone else raising her. I wish I was dead. But I also dont wish it because then who will my daughter have?

1c6hhs0;I’m tired of waiting ;Imaginary-Net-3892;I’m tired of waiting one more day. I’m tired of waiting so that I don’t ruin planned vacations or make things more stressful for friends and family during difficult times or disrupt projects at work. I’m tired. I know that calling it quits would devastate my family and my ex-wife but it just feels so selfish to want someone to keep doing something that isn’t working for them because it is working for you. I do meaningful work, people seem to like me, and I have hobbies that temporarily pull me up to neutral but it all feels so pointless. Like Sisyphus pushing a bolder up a hill only to wake up having nothing to show for all his hard work because it’s rolled back down to its starting point. I’m not the man I want to be and I don’t think I ever can be. All I’ve ever wanted is a loving family of my own but I’m not in a headspace to date again and even if I was I can’t imagine any self-respecting woman would want me. Yeah I’ve got a ton of positives but at the end of the day I cheated on my ex-wife twice, abused her for a number of years before I started doing therapy and voluntarily completed a batterers intervention program (I’ve never been arrested so it’s not something I had to do, I wanted to do it) and have hsv1. I don’t doubt that I could eventually get dates but all of that will have to come out eventually because relationships are based on honesty and if I put myself in a good woman’s shoes all of that is going to be a deal breaker because even if a man is the perfect partner now I would never be able to know if he’d relapse and abuse and cheat on me too. The fact that I cheated a second time after having been a good partner for years makes me worried I’d relapse too and I don’t want to hurt anybody else. My therapist says you can’t separate my sins from the context of the relationship they occurred in but I just don’t think that’s a reasonable expectation to place on other people.

I'm afraid that if I don't kill myself now, I'll kill myself later and leave her as a single mother and shit. If I killed myself now, I would deeply hurt her, but after some time she would definitely be able to find someone better than me.I kinda hope she finds someone now.. so she can leave me and I can kill myself in peace.I'm such a bad person.;I already have a method that should be successful.

1c6gtl8;I’m 22, and can’t help but compare my life to other people my age.;Altruistic_Body_555;Hello! I’m a 22M, and I’m someone who has dealt with hardships my entire life. Two suicide attempts, depression, anxiety, been to jail, financial issues, difficulty keeping a job, etc.From 18-20 I was in and out of two relationships, one was for about a year and a half and one was for about 6 months. I definitely jumped into the second one way too fast as a way to get over the feelings of the first girl, hence why it lasted only 6 months.I was working at Jimmy Johns during these two years, and even though looking back 18-20 isn’t too old to be working in fast food at all, I still felt like a bum.Anyways when I turned 21 my life changed for the better. One thing I valued in myself is that I can talk to anyone about anything, and I got a sales job selling phone lines starting in December 2022 (now realizing it’s an MLM pyramid scheme) however during the first 6 months I was absolutely loving life. Just being able to put myself out there made me strengthen my social skills so much, and I became the top salesman in the company (out of like 30-35 people) and was consistently one of the best, if not the best. I was building my team of salespeople, building leaders, conducting in-person interviews, and bringing home over $1000 after tax every week.So May 2022 rolls around and this really pretty girl joins the company, long story short we start dating even though we are coworkers. After we started dating I got hella complacent. A huge red flag that for some reason I completely ignored is in between the first two months of us dating, she tried to overdose TWICE, and her mental health and our relationship as a whole really started to affect me at work. Sales went down, my commitment to the business as a whole went down, and I ended up wanting to break up with her so I could refocus myself on the business but I knew it would be awkward as hell because we were coworkers, and she had no intention of wanting to be my friend after she fell in love with me. So I ended up quitting and going back to fast food. During around this time I opened up a credit card and got a new car with a loan of $6000 (now about $5400) and to this day the credit card is still maxed out to this day ($2500) and it’s been hard to pay it off fully but I do have a plan, as I have been delivery driving for the same fast food company and making decent money ($20-25 an hour) while working 45-50 hours a week. I’ve been trying to pay it off as fast as possible except the same car I got a loan for ended up having an insane amount of underlying issues (coolant leak repair, brake pads, transmission mount, new tires) all totaling over $3000 the last 6 months or so.So now I’m 22 turning 23 next month, have about $7000 in total debt from my car to my credit card and I still owe my dad a couple thousand because thankfully he’s been able to help with some of my car issues. I feel like most of the people my age have their shit together and I’m starting to get suicidal idealtions again because I feel like I’m so behind and I don’t have the drive anymore to pick up the pieces.;Hello!

1c6ggbw;I'm the worst person I know.;Sandwitchboy;Over a year ago I broke up with my girlfriend. At the time I thought I wasn't in love with her anymore, because I thought we had grown into different people with different plans for love. I ran away from my emotions for a long time, not even feeling sad about the break up for months, while I could see that she was hurting. I was a horrible person, seeing all her pain and feeling nothing but apathy. I finally got in touch with my feelings a couple months ago, opening up to the fact that I made a mistake and I've been spiraling ever since. I hate myself for what I've done, for how I've treated her and falling out of love with her. I miss her so incredibly much, but I know I don't deserve sympathy for hurting someone who is themselves an amazing person. I don't see worth in going on like this anymore, even if I managed to forgive myself I could never get over her. She was the best person I ever met and I hurt her like no one else.

1c6fpon;I am unsure how to feel now...;G4y_Fr0g_1;"This event occurred years back when I was in 7th grade. When I was in the 7th grade I had a friend who we will call Luke (not his real name) Luke would always make weird comments and flirt with me but I ignored it. One day he kissed me in front of his girlfriend and then left her to beg to be with me, I am an empath and even though I wanted to say no he scared me so I said yes. I ended up getting the guts to leave him but he threatened to kill himself if I did, so I stayed. He constantly hit me, pushed me around, and even ripped my clothes a few times while calling me names and putting me down. But for some reason, I couldn't let go of him and when I was rude he threatened to leave me and even though a part of me knew I should've let him leave I just cried and begged him not to. We were ""together"" for about 3 months and technically he was my first kiss and my first time but I didn't want to count it as that. He had major anger issues and is part of the reason I have major anger issues now as well, I am in therapy for it but constantly think about hurting him, sometimes even killing him. He ended raping me multiple times and for months after it happened I said I was fine even though I wasn't. I told myself and everyone that I didn't blame myself but one day while I was having a panic attack I was crying my eyes out and said ""If only I hadn't fucking trusted him!"" My friend who was comforting me looked at me confused and kept asking what was wrong, I freaked out when I realized that I blamed myself and cried more. That same friend (who we will call Sara) is the one who told the school counselor about him pushing me to the ground and she called my mom which led to my mom calling the police. At the time I blamed my friend for reporting Luke and I wish I hadn't told her I even said to her ""I hope you die"" But a few months ago my other friend told me how she was in a similar situation with a guy and I realized that she loved him as much as I loved Luke and wasn't going to let go of him. I realized in that moment how Sara had felt and how I was wrong to blame her. Sadly I never got to apologize to Sara as she died in a shooting the next year. I forever hold the guilt of blaming her and cry so much because the day she died in the shooting we were supposed to be together and I refused to go because I hated her and she died alone. I hate myself and constantly think about hurting myself or doing something worse for blaming her now that I have been in her position and just hope she rests peacefully now.";This event occurred years back when I was in 7th grade.

1c6fpfh;My loneliness has consumed me. ;belitville;I’m 25, F, UK based. I grew up in a rather unconventional household which I guess set me up for failure from the start. I moved school a lot and always struggled to make friends. I’ve never really had any. I was bullied constantly, slipped into depression at 12 when I first tried to kill myself. This has stayed with me my entire life. Despite being told it would get better. It’s 13 years on and it never did. I built this hard dislikable shell around me. I started uni at 16 and did pretty well academically in my undergrad and subsequent postgrads. I still struggled to make friends or talk to people. Possibly because i was younger than everyone. I spent these years isolated, drinking and taking drugs alone. I was never fond of alcohol but it was the only thing that helped me through my loneliness. Of the few friends I had, I cut them off after uni. I was and still am toxic and aggressive. I’d spend hours a day talking to myself, I still do this. On the outside though, life was easy. I came from a wealthy family, I’m attractive, connected and educated.   I’ve always known what I wanted from life, it’s the same as everyone - to meet a man I love and adore to give me lots of children. I learned quickly that I’m not the type of person people want to be in a relationship with. I think people like the idea of me but the reality is different. I’m quite rude, self-entitled, I have alcohol/ drug problems, and I’m unemployed. I’ve never had much motivation to get a job and have never been told I had to.  I tried a few times but even the thought of being interviewed filled me with this gut wrenching fear. Of the few I did go to I didn’t get the job, this just reinforced the fact that I’m not good enough so I stopped trying. In the years after uni I did try to better myself. I quit the drugs, drink and smoking. I found a sport I love and dedicated myself to it. For the first time in my life I was passionate about something, it made me happy, I was good at it too. On the baseline everything was still the same though. No matter how hard I tried to better myself, people still didn’t like me. After an injury I slipped back into my old ways. 13 years on from my first attempt and I’m exactly the same, things never got better. I was promised they would but they didn’t. I’m still the same spiteful and lonely bitch I’ve always been. I’m never going to change, I let the best years of my life pass me by. People don’t like me, I know why.

This makes me lose sleep and also always stay in the dark although I still feel paranoid thinking if I'm still being watched Amidst the darkness somehow.

I also used to feel like I'm being talked about or made fun of or something like I'm a useless person and nobody wants me and everyone wants to get rid of me. And I still feel that way. I don't know if this comes under bedding paranoid or not. I also feel like someone's heading what I'm saying too and keeping an eye. I know that no one really cares about me and watching me is not worth their time. But I think there's something. My phone's battery is also getting drained pretty soon these days. It happened thrice where I see the battery percentage reducing every second although I'm not using it. My flashlight gets on without anything and sometimes the message I send on WhatsApp is like as if I sent it twice. I don't know if all these things are connected or if it's just me.

I want to be able to live like I’m supposed to. I feel so lonely. I’ve already tried to end it all, but I got too scared, so maybe that was a sign? But then again, I’m not too sure about that. I don’t know what exactly I'm looking for here. validation, maybe? Who knows.Also, I hope I’m not breaking the rules.

1c6f509;I think about it every day and I'm sure I'll do it;lil_cheap;Probably this week-end.I have a good life, filled with many success, but everything i care is love. I have not any purpose to live, all my life was just ok until i met a girl, we staid together 7 years before she breaks up. After that i was pretty sure to commit it, but was put in hospital by my family, to be helped. The only thing that helped me was a relationship i started with a colleague. I was not into it and was still thinking about my ex fiancee. She had mental troubles and i was not here for her, we had difficulties to make it work and she obviously was not the perfect person to me. I met another girl when i was with her, so i broke up. To be short, i am still thinking about my ex, the colleague, we stayed together 2 years. I dont know why i am so attached to this girl, i mean, why am i still thinking about her while i left her. I know she's starting a new life, i realised that i'll never see her again and it kills me from the inside. I hurt her a lot, she doesn't want to hear from me anymore. My whole life only had meaning through the girls I loved idk why.Anyway, i lost the last girl i really loved Just because i thought it was better for me to be with a more ''stable'' girl, wich is probably right. But i don't care anymore, i Just never care about life and i know it has to be stoppedI really want to do it, i am thinking about what last note i will left.;Probably this week-end.I have a good life, filled with many success, but everything i care is love. ;;0;1;2024-04-17 17:02:19;2024-04-17;Wednesday;17:02:19;1386;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-19 13:34:13.279676
1c6ezcz;i dont feel like myself anymore ;Ok_Leg_644;I dont know whats happening tbh. The last few weeks i havent felt alive, almost like im dead but just experiencing life as a passanger in my body. It feels like i do everything on autopilot. It feels like im not watching the world through my own eyes but someone elses. When i have these episodes, and look around me, i almost dont recognize my surroundings. I also Completely zone out. i can suddenly just get locked staring at the wall for 30 minutes without having known time has passed. I've felt more and more like running away or hurting myself because none of my problems are getting any better. I've struggled bad for 4 years now and nothing has improved, if anything i've gotten worse, and i have a psychiatrist. I dont know what to tell him, i dont even know if he will belive me. He'll probably suggest being sent to a psych ward again, which helped for a while, but now im worse than before i got there.

1c6eb9q;My life has gone to shit from alcohol, meth, and homelessness & heartbreak.;icepipeextortionist;"I'm 21M now, since I was 17 I have been drinking and smoking pot and going in to rehab nonstop whenever my parents felt uncomfortable with my addiction. As of December 2023 my older beautiful 1010 ex 28M only gay relationship I liked. had started talking to me again giving me a second chance. However I was still popping amphetamines under the radar, so my parents called the cops on me for suicidal ideas I didn't even say and then was flown out to Mississippi for rehab. After I got out of rehab my parents still kept me away from home and bought me a bus to Texas to ""get a job"". My ex still talked to me but without any friends or family I started smoking meth to pass time. I decided to go to rehab and since then I lost my phone and have been in and out begging my family to come home it's April now and I caught a felony for Delta 8 which is legal. And yesterday out of knowehere my ex cut me off after wishing me good on my sobriety. And I'm now heartbroken and have no desire now to change my life cause I know I could've  been with him sooner. I'm a bisexual that's caught up in resentment for my past decisions and now being somebody's bitch. All I want now is too get $200 for a hotel room and $100 for a gram of meth and fentanyl to get the job done.

They know how I feel about them and we've spoken in depth about this but this just compounds my original feelings and cemented my plans.For now I have a few more days with them and then once I know they are safe, I'll finish what I started.

1c6dyaz;I don’t see the point anymore;Sully-lV;I want to kill myself. I’ve never seen the point to life I never had anything I especially wanted to accomplish there’s never been anything in my life I’ve felt is meaning full but I was born that way so I never knew anything different. I’ve accomplished some stuff in my life and I’m sure my life isn’t that terrible, I’ve got a full ride medical scholarship, I’ve got a house, my parents are well off, I have loads of friends, I get women I’ve had a couple of gfs my life is great by all metrics but none of it ever meant anything. It was always what was expected the norm why would it be any different. Everything changed when I met this girl, now by far she probably wouldn’t be considered the best girl I’ve dated or even the prettiest but something with her was different. I know cliche. We talked for two months and she said she loved me she told her mother and grandmother about me. I met her mother, I’m great friend with her sister, she wanted to go to my uni this coming semester, we wanted to get married (I know it’s fast but in my culture it’s kinda normal) and for the two months we talked I genuinely enjoyed my life. I had something to look forward too. Something to live for. Then I fucked it up, we were still talking as she wanted to wait before we dated but she wasn’t talking to anyone else and neither was I. Until this girl slid into my DMs, now this girl is a 10/10 I’ll be honest but honestly I just can’t be attracted to anyone else and I can’t see anyone else in that way. So I have no idea  why I responded but I did. We chatted a bit and she made it clear she liked me, I told her I was talking to someone but since we weren’t dating I thought it was fine and so new girl. That same night I told the girl I wanted to marry let’s call her T, about new girl let’s call her F. T flipped out and started crying and by the end of the night she had me remove F of everything and then said she needed space but still loved me and still wanted to be with me eventually. Now here’s where I really fucked up, I couldn’t stand the thought of being alone so I reached out to F and for a week we talked and I was honest when T asked about this. Then T told me she needed time and asked if I’d wait. Now the last week without her in my life was the absolute worst of my life and told her this and eventually I told her I’d wait but I would rather I didn’t have to. She told she wasn’t sure about me anymore and didn’t want me to wait when did wasn’t sure I told her that I didn’t care and I’d wait regardless and I blocked F because as great as she is I can’t see myself loving anyone else. (Some context I’ve never loved anyone in my life and I’m the type of person to not even say the words I love you but with T I would want to). Anyways she texted me and she said it’s over between us I essentially begged her to not make that decision now and that id wait as long as it took. That was 2 hours ago, waiting and not knowing is killing me I’ve been sat on the roof about 4 stories up for the last 90 mins. I can’t see myself living without her she means too much to me and it hurt too much. Reading that message put me in physical pain and I havnt stopped thinking about her since I met her but now all I can I think about is how much I fucked how and how stupid I was. I’m genuinely considering just putting an end to it because I can’t keep living like this. I’ve never seen the point in life until I met her and without her I know my life will just be misery. I’m only waiting to talk to her sister and her sisters bf both my freinds to see if maybe there’s a genuine chance. I honestly don’t know what I hope to accomplish by writing this or even if anyone will read it but I can’t tell my friends I’m suicidal and I need to get my emotions and thoughts out there. So yea the girl of my dreams left me and I don’t want to live.;I want to kill myself.

I'm just below average at everything I fucking do. I know I won't do well on my own, whenever I try to do something I fuck it up, no matter how fucking hard I try. So I don't include other people, so they wouldn't blame me, the only person I could blame would be myself, and it fucking hurts me how bad I am at life. At the simplest shit I still find a way to fail, others acknowledging that life will be hard for me just looking at me. I don't want any bad for people, I want everyone to do well, I try to teach and help people as much as I can, but in return all of the shit I avoid from others, comes straight to me. How is it that the more effort I give in, the more I feel depressed because I know this shit wouldnt work out nonetheless - I could have just given up from the beginning and the result wouldn't be much different. How the fuck do people live this life? Why does everyone have it easier than me? I've been so fucking depressed for the last year it is fucking me up in every way. I'm just numb at this point, have no interest in talking with anyone else than my own parents - fuck everybody else I have, I know they're taking advantage of me every second. Everything has been dark and joyless for me for the last year. I don't see death as something bad, more like a fucking relief from all of this. And I supposedly need to man up from all this shit? If I'm not gonna hurt myself, I am gonna go fucking insane and crazy and might hurt someone else at some point. If this is what life is, I don't wanna live longer than 4 years. I'm even more fucking mad now realizing how fucking bad I expressed myself. I can never prove myself to the fullest, I know it is just me as a whole who is holding all of this shit back, and it hurts me so badly inside. It is all my fucking fault.

1c6d93u;I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.;Embarrassing-Fart;This is my first post to reddit. I, 18F, have been living with crippling depression and anxiety since I was 9. I've attempted suicide multiple times, and I've learned from my mistakes and know what will work now. I've tried all the coping skills and grounding techniques, I'm in therapy, I've been to mental hospitals, I've been on countless different medications. Nothing works. I've lived with severe emotional neglect my entire life. I still live at home even though I have a full time and part time job. The only thing that was keeping me here was my pets but I know my family will either keep or give them away(I have a dog, a cat, and a horse) I know someone who'd be willing to take my horse. My family likes my cat because she'd a good mouser, and my mother and younger sister love my dog even though she's quite annoying. I never asked to be born. I've lived through shit that no kid should ever have to live through. When I was 10 I was targeted by an online sexual predator. When I was 13 my best friend since kindergarten left me because I was too introverted and she loved making new friends. On my 15th birthday my father was admitted to the hospital because he was going to commit suicide. A week after my sister's 15th birthday by dad went missing and was found 5 days later dead in the mountains. I think suicide, but the coroner ruled it a heart attack. My father was my only and biggest supporter and advocate. Even though he wasn't present a lot in my youth because of work, he was still an amazing dad. He's the only person I have ever actually missed in my entire life. My mother outted me as being bisexual by going through my phone when I was 15 and told me that because I was a minor I didn't get privacy, and from that point forward she monitored my phone activity. I've tried to be happy. I've tried to do fun things. But when you can't afford to do the things you like simply because you're trying to keep yourself and others alive, it's hard. I'm old enough now to buy the things I need for my plans. Sorry for jumping around a lot. My mind is a mess I can't untangle. I don't know when exactly, but I know I will not be living much longer. Probably won't make it past a month since we're putting my late father's dog down for severe aggression and he was the last thing I had that made me feel connected to him.;This is my first post to reddit.

1c6cav7;I want to end it all… (17, MtF, partially closeted);UglyGirl83;So I have 3 friends and unsupportive family. First one which I consider my best friend, at least considered. We know each other for 10 years. I had a crush on him last summer and I still have. He came out to me as mtf trans in summer and I used she/ her pronouns on him. But now he still calls himself man, even tho I feel like he’s lying. On his twitter it says she/ her lesbian so I don’t think he is man. But he is probably really scared. I would like to talk to him, but he’s been distancing from me since I came out. I badly want to talk to him, but I don’t know how should I start, and I don’t want to lose this person. He also doesn’t use my new name and pronouns. Second one is using my new name and pronouns. He is really perfect friend. I had deep talk with him, and he made me feel really safe and better. He wants us four to go somewhere together, but it is always hard. Because I think we 4 won’t be great friend group. And of course I will be the problem, because every one of them sees me differently. Third one is from really conservative family. When I started presenting feminine he used to call me manageress or girl sometimes. He did it for fun, but I liked it. Now as he knows I’m trans, he always calls me ugly girl, for fun of course, but it is so often that it hurts. Today he texted me to play Minecraft, he changed my sign with name over my bed with my “deadname”. I built trans flag and he burnt it. I left and I don’t talk to him, on discord server I told him to fuck off, and we haven’t talked since. And I actually don’t want to, fuck him.Fuck everything, everyone and I really am at the edge. I have one person who supports me. But he also has his life so I don’t want to bother him too much. I feel like I never be good for anybody. I was posting pics on my main acc, and people were actually calling me pretty and passing. So people are the biggest problem now. Dysphoria too, but people make it worse. I want to die now.;So I have 3 friends and unsupportive family.

1c6c92x;No more reason to go on;PrettyComment4079;Most of my family is dead or in prison. I'm not in contact with any family members anymore. I couldn't stand being used for all I've got and with nothing in return except having my trust betrayed and my heart ripped out and stomped on over and over again. Favoring the rapists and the drug addicts in the family for reasons I can never comprehend. I have zero friends. I sabotaged all of my closest friendships and eventually cut everyone else out to avoid the spiral of self destruction again. I hate doing it and I hate hurting other people. I thought isolating myself would bring peace and make me happy. It didn't. I don't even know how to make new friends. I try but I can't get it out of my head that everyone hates me. I can't relate to anyone anyway. I feel like I don't even live on the same planet as the rest of the world. I know I'm the problem but I don't know how to fix it. I can't stay in my relationship anymore. He's not the same person, he's so mean, he's completely irrational, he's going out of his way to hurt me. His dad went to prison for raping his step daughter and since then he completely changed and it is terrifying. I put years of my life into this relationship. I believed that this time was really the one I was gonna build up a peaceful little life for myself. It's like I live with a stranger now that gets off on seeing me upset. I can't handle it. I just can't do this anymore.It is so scary and I have nowhere else to go. I don't have a car anymore. I don't have any money. I have nobody to talk to. I can't go to therapy. I can't get on medication. I'm trapped in a hell hole with no way out.I've spent years bettering myself and learning to manage my BPD. To be a better daughter and a better partner. I stopped lashing out, stopped abusing hallucinogens and alcohol, stopped mutilating my skin, stopped crying everyday, I have done everything that was ever asked of me. I have worked to fix everything about myself that caused pain to other people. I wanted to be good enough for somebody. But no matter how much I give, I can't get even a fraction of that back. It really hurts. I've never been self absorbed, I used to pride myself on my loyalty and patience and forgiveness. Now I feel like a fool for letting myself be used by everyone and a terrible person for wanting to be loved by someone.I've made some horrible mistakes that it looks like I won't be able to move on from. People have been telling me since I was 7 years old that it gets better. It hasn't. I'm almost 25 now. I've given it my honest best effort. It wasn't enough for anyone. I can't do this anymore. I can't stay here and there's no where to go.There's only one option left. I'm so afraid. But I know if I back out now, I'll only end up regretting it later. If you have a loved on with Borderline personality disorder, I hope you'll reach out to them.

1c6c49s;A logical argument for NOT committing suicide when death makes more sense than living;chandanritvik;"One of my best friend recently committed suicide & I couldn't help but contemplate these things.  A normal person easily accepts the fact without thought that suicide is a foolish decision. ""What kind of fool will end this (sometimes) wonderful life?""  But for some people life sucks so much that quitting is a logical decision.  WHO states there is 1 sucide every 40 seconds. 700,000 people dying every year. This is just scratching the surface. Because 20x (14 million) times people, have been contemplating suicide but couldn't act/die as planned.  X represents things a person likes in life. Y represents those he doesn't like in life. When Y >> X, suicide is a logical option for them. Of course they have strived to change, but unfortunately they couldn't bring down Y.  But, recently something struck. What if, you change your mind into living solely for others' sake? Hear me out, this is powerful  There is not much you can do when you can't change YOUR life. But, just consider that your life has already ended. Spend each hour & day for the benifit of other people you love. This maynot be any single person at all. Just have a bunch of people in your mind (friends & family), whom you would like to serve. Perform every action in life assuming that they are the people who are going to benifit from the act. Also make real endeavours to uplift & beautify their lives.  Living purely for others' sake is beautiful & also logical. Why? Putting hard efforts for one day may not decrease 'Y' [your problems] as much as you would like. But you can easily act in a positive additive way for others. It also gives a much higher satisfaction & purpose for living.  Anything you guys would like to add?";One of my best friend recently committed suicide & I couldn't help but contemplate these things.

1c6bhri;19 with no relationships and many mental health issues;Appropriate_Net_9511;I have never been able to keep myself at any job for longer than a few months. It’s not like I don’t want to work but I usually get really depressed and feel immature for not just being ok with the way things are. All I want to be is normal and not be a burden to everyone. I didn’t graduate high school and I’m very insecure about that, during covid and online school (10th grade) I really just gave up and stopped doing school work showing up to classes or overall trying. My 9th grade year was decent and I made fine grades without trying very hard at all but everything went down hill after that.My childhood is filled with moving from school to school and I was never able to form genuine connections with anyone throughout middle school or even high school. I never even attended 12th grade after my mom gave me the option to attend on online program which I cheated my way through. Im very emotional and that blinds reasoning or logical a lot of the times, my confidence is only based on my achievements and if I havn’t done something interesting in a while I get very depressed and feel useless. I currently work with a marketing company that I feel guilty for working at, we raise money for charities but it just feels like I’m a glorified begger. I got into weed at 16 when getting kicked out of my Moms house after getting into an argument because I felt like she was supporting her boyfriend over me and my brother. Ive been smoking ever since with some attempts to stop and even a long one after having a major belief crisis where I became a zealot for the God I worshiped at the time. I am very paranoid and constantly overthink every interaction or past and future event. I constantly feel like at the slightest inconvenience that my life already dull life will fall apart and I’ll end up getting raped in prison, homeless or murdered. I hate myself and sometimes forget that so I end up hating the people around me. I failed in life and even my conception was a mistake. I cant support myself and overthink my way out of anything that might be good for me.If I could find an easy way to kill myself I would first do a bunch of drugs and then just die.;I have never been able to keep myself at any job for longer than a few months.

1c6a358;Troubled Marriage - Feel like suicide is my only way out;Nostalgic_Carrot;In advance - forgive me for my poor description. I am not in any state to be writing in great detail.TLDR I have been in an abusive (in every possible way, including physically) marriage for about 6 years. My wife beats me without remorse for any mistake that I make. (In fairness, sometimes she exercises restraint, but I never know when it will come, and the violence occurs at least half of the time). When I tell her it is not okay to respond that way she says that I deserve it for making her angry, or for doing something that she has told me she doesn't like. Maybe I am crazy but part of me believes I deserve it. Maybe I do deserve this for always managing to annoy her and ruin her mood. I think there is something inherently wrong with me if I can anger someone to this point on an almost daily basis just by being myself.Anyway, I don't see any way out. When I tell her I want a divorce or separation, it is met by her destroying my belongings or threatening to harm herself. I still care about her, and the thought of that happening crushes me, I don't think I could live with myself if she did. Sometimes I think the only way out of this marriage is if I die. Has anyone else felt like this before? I find myself thinking about it more and more. I am so tired.;In advance - forgive me for my poor description.

I've been trying to fix myself and not fail out of life for years now with trying to pass school, do therapy, take medication etc. but there's nothing that can get me to do anything to help myself. I can't even get myself to apply for a job without feeling like it's impossible. I believe this is because of beliefs I made when I first got depressed that life is meaningless, and whatever I want out of life (girlfriend, good job, friends etc.), I won't get. I've had close friends and therapists tell me over and over that my beliefs aren't true but I can't seem to think otherwise. Yes, I'm not able to predict the future but I'm the one living this life and know damn well what my circumstances are. Even through the times I was to go into remission and not be plagued by anxiety/depression, I wasn't able to achieve anything and just failed over and over and over.

I feel that I’m at the breaking point and that if even the smallest thing goes south in the next days, I may take a radical decision. How can I control myself?

I hate everyone I met, I hate my family and I hate myself. I tried my best to heal trauma and childhood bullshit and of course I go down the spiritual path. I did ayahuasca and that fucked me up, but not too bad. I just had to work with high spiritually beings, who don't give a single fuck about me. They ruined my life, yet they and the whole occult side preach about empowerment and its your life. Yet, not one of those assholes can help me get rid of these stupid spirits which I DIDNT EVEN SUMMON. Everything is pointless, I'm sick of trying . I'm sick of not having control of my mind or life no matter what I do. I'm sick of dealing with assholes in real life. The only way out is to kms. I believe in a life after death, so I'm not scared.

1c67zdo;Severity of my mental state is invisible to everyone;Greedy-Board619;(Sorry for the shitty censoring, idk what Reddit allows yet)Throwaway. M20. I’ve dealt with clinical depression many years now since I was a kid. Some childhood/environmental factors and a couple personality-shifting events but ultimately it’s genetic. Anxiety has gotten absolutely debilitating over the last couple years though. I’ve voluntarily admitted myself to inpatient psychiatric care twice after a couple scary incidents involving some bad s ideation. I’ll have periods of time where I’m doing really well for a short amount of time only for me to fall right back down to the bottom.Part of my issue is my inability to speak up for myself and communicate my needs. Blah blah abusive childhood etc blah blah. It’s almost impossible for me to ask for help or let people know I’m hurting, mostly because I don’t wanna be seen as the person always drowning and always needing a life preserver. I hate the thought of being that kind of person. But no one sees how deeply this shit runs. Im not honest with anybody. I’ve never been fully honest with anybody. Not with my therapist. I think about hvrting myself all the time. All the time. In so many ways. Viciously. I think about other people hvrting me. All the ways I could go. In the car, on the street. Recently I’ve realized I may by definition have h0m1c1dal thoughts even though I’d never hurt someone intentionally. Idk how to explain. I’m slipping pretty close to addiction and need to be careful. There’s even been a few episodes of intense paranoia too. There’s a lot of shame and self loathing. Got a lot of hatred for myself. So that’s another reason it’s hard for me to reach out. Idk. Anyone else? Any advice? I don’t know what to do because I feel like I am this close to coming undone and no one even notices.;(Sorry for the shitty censoring, idk what Reddit allows yet)Throwaway.

1c67fx3;I’m positive I’m a fuck up and am ready to go.;Slideitinhoney;All my life I’ve been nothing but a fuck up. My sister was perfect, had amazing grades, never got in trouble, was always good at home, went to college has a good job.I’ve been the opposite, in middle school I barely made graduation at the last minute because I ran around begging teachers to boost my grades, and some reluctantly did. One teacher said he would as long as we promised him that we would graduate high school and I let him down. In high school I was in a illegal business and failed my classes, got into fights and got kicked out. I went to an alternative school and still didn’t try. As an adult I was working whatever jobs I could get and I got addicted to oxycodone and xanax. I crashed my car when I blacked out off of Xanax and got a DUI. I was strung out infront of my family and I probably traumatized them. I’m sober now but I’ve already ruined everything. I’ve asked my dad if I could go to work with him just to learn how it is and he said all I’ll do is stress him out and ruin his day. My mom has distanced herself and only really shows love to my little sister which I completely understand. My siblings don’t want to talk to me much and treat me like I’m still addicted. The only person who still shows me unconditional love is my grandpa. I’ve somehow managed to land a relationship with a woman who makes my days so much better and I love her with everything I have but because of my past trauma from past relationships I always let my insecurities and irrational thoughts get the better of me and I often cause fights. Tonight I caused another dumb one and this time she got really upset and told me she was on the brink of crying.That was my last straw. I’ve realized that all I do is ruin things and hurt the people that I love. I’m just a carrier of destruction with only one way to be stopped. The thought of removing myself from this world and finally letting the people I love and have hurt, heal and move on with their lives without being held back by me is comforting and makes me confident in the choice to remove myself.I’ve thought about it and I don’t want to shoot myself and cause a mess for my family to clean up. I hear hanging yourself is extremely painful, I already tried offing myself by cutting my arms open but it was extremely painful and unsuccessful. I’ve decided on ODing. I know someone who sells fentanyl pills and ima take 10 and go to sleep. I’ll wipe my phone before I do so the person who will supply me with the pills doesn’t get in trouble. Im 90% positive that’s what I want to do.I know that no one is going to read all this and it’ll go undetected but if one person reads this I appreciate you for reading what quite possibly be my last words. Much love to you all.;All my life I’ve been nothing but a fuck up.

1c66wik;I think it may be time ;DepartmentIntrepid68;I’m 19 I’ve been homeless and in and out of friends houses since I was 17. I recently moved into my friends house that they offered to allow me into and was told I can stay as long as I need to get in my feet. Yesterday I woke up to my friends mom trying to bring me to social security and a homeless shelter without warning at all. I haven’t even been here for a month. I wasn’t even there for five seconds before a man tried to hit on me at the shelter. I have one cat and she’s the only family I have left she’s everything to me and I love her to death. Any of the options other than living here would take my cat from me she is an emotional support animal and I would be unhappy in life without her. My dad isn’t reliable and I don’t talk to my mother. I do chores I go to work I keep clean but she is still trying to get rid of me and last night my cat had babies right after I came back to my friends house from meeting with a creepy man to be a potential roommate just so I don’t have to sleep on the street. Of course he had ulterior motives and I don’t think I’ll be able to find anyone who doesn’t.  I’m completely running out of options and I think just ending my life is the best one. I’m tired of living my life as a stray dog no one wants to deal with. I’m a burden to everyone around me and I’m a burden to myself I don’t make enough to live off of and I am still trying to finish high school. I can’t finish high school, go to work everyday , take care of my cat and six kittens, and be homeless. I think killing myself is the only way to help myself and the people around me. I don’t want to be everyone’s problem anymore. I just want to be safe secure and happy but the second I felt that it was ripped away from me. There is truly no point in me being here anymore as I’ve been shown time and time again me or my life does not matter. Theres no end to things just going bad and wrong and disappointing and the second I feel maybe I’ll be okay another thing happens to make it worse just so I won’t be happy. Sometimes I feel like this is some joke a higher power is laughing at me for like my horrible life is some sort of entertainment. I’m tired of being sad. I’m tired of being a burden. I’m tired of my best bit being enough and no one seeing any worth in me unless I’m sleeping with them. I always try to be grateful for the good things in my life but that’s just my cat and now they want to take her away from me. I truly have no one but myself.

1c66umv;I want to die and I will die. ;Average_SgGirl;"I remember when I was only 2 years old I got strangled by my own mother and was at my last breath after she let go. My parents are both divorced and I'm okay with that because they have already been divorced since I was 4 months old and they have a 12 year age gap. I secretly know I am a mistake. When I was 7 my mother abandoned me at my grandmas house and I lived there until I was 11. I am currently 12 years old btw. Last year was the best days of my entire life because I became popular and hang out with friends every week. I slowly started developing a crush for a boy. Before I liked the boy let's name him""O"" I liked another guy let's name him ""J"" I also hanged out with J and O and another girl named ""K"" and a boy named ""W"" sometimes some of us will usually hang out. I remember clearly one time we were at the movies and we were watching Barbie and I was sitting next to O I don't know but I think he actually liked me but at the time I found him weird and just a friend and I also remember him holding my hand on that day. Fast forward to my birthday ""27 August 2023"" I was hanging out with friends near my house and I got dared to kiss K . Later on at around 8pm it was just me, K and my friend named SSince everyone had left we decided to go to S's house later suddenly K said she had to leave but she actually stole my wallet and left. I am not going to go deep into this because I forgot most parts. Fast forward to the present O hates me for some reason and I still like him. I actually confessed that I liked him last year. Anyways this year is psle which in Singapore is super important for the sixth graders I am constantly stressed everyday and thought about death everyday. I even found many strands of white hair in my hair which is probably due to stress. I have no real friends. The guy that was actually nice to me now hates me. And I still like him. I hate it how I got replaced as drama leader this year for my cca. My friend group all hates me. Especially a girl named L. She is ugly asf. Anyways my old crush ""J"" always calls me fat and ugly for some reason even though I'm average weightaand not even close to being overweight. I hate it how all my cousins are smart they got Al8 and Al11 for their total psle score. I hate it how I think I'll probably get Al20 which is a bit lower then normal. I hate it how people call me dumb even though I know it's true. I hate it how people don't take me seriously. I hate it how my friend S always prefers another girl named ""Q"".S will always rub it in my face that she is partnering with "" Q"" it makes me very annoyed. I hate it how my life is so much worse then it ever was and wish that I could just go back to being a 11 year old. Everyone thinks I don't like ""O"" anymore but I secretly love him. I wish I could reverse my life.Today is 17 april 2024 and by the time you read this I have died. I hate this world. And lastly I hate how all my friends secretly hate me and I know.

1c66r2v;The only time people validate me is when I say I'm suicidal;Future-Brief-3642;"Title.   It really sucks because I know that under normal circumstances, they would never agree with what I said. They'd ask me to ""man up"" and take charge of my life.  To ""stop moping and whining about your problems all the fucking time and do something about it for once"".   Yet here I am on a sub-reddit dedicated to suicidal people. I just.....can't sit around doing nothing and watch myself fall into a bigger hole. I either want to have a good enough life for myself or die. That's why I'm here. To make that choice.  I am a 19 y/o male doing a double major in a prestigious university. Both my degrees are in STEM. I don't want to elaborate further to preserve my anonymity. I got into this university because the academic calendar in 2022 was fucked up due to COVID. Major exams were delayed as were university admissions. This resulted in fewer applications to my uni and hence I got in with a profile that traditionally would not be considered good enough.   After coming here, I struggled a lot to compete with the geniuses here (about 70% of my batch can be considered to be part of the ""traditional intake"" of my uni where as the remaining 30% of us got in like I did). Fast forward two years and now I'm at the end of my 4th semester. I have a GPA of 6 out of 10 (The median GPA here is 7.5 and anything below 7 is considered bad). I feel too dumb to do anything with my life. I am unable to grasp the concepts being taught no matter how hard I struggle. It's like I'm watching my life spiral downwards and there's nothing I can do. about it.   I also have an addiction to porn and masturbation. I use it as an escape from reality. Excessive masturbation has made me weak and very thin. I am easy to defeat in a fight. I barely have the stamina to run more than 500m without getting breathless.  I have no friends or a social life of any kind because of my inability to keep a consistent schedule owing to certain health issues and also because I can't relate to people in general anymore. Like I don't get how talking bout sex, gossiping about everyone else, joking with dark humour all the time and being pessimistic about everything is fun for everyone. Like I want to talk about our issues in life, our futures and the possibility of doing things that seem magical or unattainable but people just laugh it off or label it ""cringey"".  I think I'm stuck in a downward spiral and I'll eventually become a financial burden to my parents and friends because if I'm too dumb for college, there ain't no way I'm going to make it out there in the real world where people including your co-workers and bosses can be out to get you.  That's why I'm slowly getting convinced suicide is the right option. I'm not just saying this after hitting a rough phase for the first time in my life. I'm saying this after struggling for 8 years with an addiction to porn and masturbation. After having been a horrible under-achiever and failure in my academics all my life. After having lost the few skills I had as a child. After having no friends over the last 4 years. After almost 2 years of sleep-less nights spent crying alone in my room or walking alone in the woods desperately praying for a solution to my problems and only ending up in a worse situation.  I used to say I'll kill myself quite a lot a couple of years back but I didn't have the balls to do it. Now I have a plan and the means and to a certain extent, I also have the courage.    I am not sure what to do right now.";Title.

I have living with depression for 7 years, since then there are not a single day my mind has spared me from the intention of killing myself. No one really care about my pain, my friends, my family, they are used to seeing me in pain now it is a normal thing to them. I can't talk to anyone about this, i can't just told to anyone i'm in so much pain everyday that i want to kill myself to end it, they will just think i'm being dramatic, lazy or insane. I was born in a country where mental illness is something doesn't exist (Vietnam). I think i will just keep going until i can't.

1c66fd3;Is this actually bad?;suicide_questioning;Is it actually bad if I give myself a timeline for when to commit suicide?As it currently stands: I'm 36, no kids, no partner, poor social skills, and no-one interested in me. I've just had my 36th birthday so I've made the decision that if nothing has changed in 2 years, then I'm going to end my life then.Because I don't want to try and have children without someone whom I can consider a life partner and it will take at least 2-3 years to determine that with anyone. So if I'm 38 and not in a relationship, and with no relationship available, then I'll be over 40 by the time I might be able to have a family which will make me far too old.So there's no point in worrying at that point about having one. But me giving up on that means giving up on a fundamental life goal, then I don't want to see the following 30-40 years, even if I did have a partner.So is it actually bad that I have a solid plan for what will count as my own end of life?;Is it actually bad if I give myself a timeline for when to commit suicide?As it currently stands: I';;9;0;2024-04-17 10:30:14;2024-04-17;Wednesday;10:30:14;948;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-19 13:34:14.410031
1c66eda;Title;saltywater42;I'm a 16 year old male and my life has been shit all around, I was raped by my father from the ages of 6 until 12, I lived on a cattle station in the outback that doubled as a bikie hq, my father was head chemist and my pops was fairly high up so they both had a lot of respect, my pops never knew what was happening and he was a great man before his passing, I ran away from the farm after stabbing my dad in the neck and now I live with my mother and my dog there is much more to my story but I don't want to waste much time I just want to leave a reminder that I was here on this earth, I enjoy writing free form poetry, hunting kangaroos and wild pigs, fishing and gaming, I'm now just a normal teenager, my mother loves me but is too invested in her work to really care for me it's ironic as she works in youth mental health, I have friends and I have just kicked some horrible drug addictions after going to a rehab service, now I only smoke weed and cigarettes. I wanted to be a soldier, not for patriotism to Australia but to kill instead. I am very confused sexually as I seem to be in love with a trans man but I don't like the thought of intercourse with a real man (by that I mean a man with a penis) his name is magnus and he's 17, anyways I only have a few weeks left before I commit. I know how I am going to do it, but have not yet decided on a date or time, most likely late at night. I've always wanted to be a normal kid but growing up my life was very different to others. I wish I had more people in my life I could talk to but it seems like no one wants to hear what I have to say. I just have a few final tasks I must complete and I shall list them here. 1. Make sure my friends have good memories of me2. Tell magnus how much I love him (going to be hard as our first date is this Saturday) 3. Smoke a shit ton of weed4.let the people in my life know it is not their fault for my death5. Not give in to my increasing homicidal thoughts.I hope at least one person will read this and think that sounds like a good kid, even if I don't always do the right thing or follow the law, I know that I am pure of heart and only wish the best for others in my life.I wish everybody who comes across this post nothing but the best.;I'm a 16 year old male and my life has been shit all around, I was raped by my father from the ages ;;1;2;2024-04-17 10:28:36;2024-04-17;Wednesday;10:28:36;2243;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-19 13:34:14.411244

I don’t want to die and I have a lot more I want to do.However it seems like everything is destined to go wrong and happen to be the worst result possible for me. I live by myself since 19. I love living freely. I have been suspected to be aspie or autistic since I was a kid. I think I definitely am, I feel like no matter how hard I try, how hard I pretend to be a good girl good woman good person, I can’t seem to understand normal humans or people, I can’t seem to blend in. Looks like everyone is so naturally getting along with each other but except for me, and I can’t understand a lot of emotions others have. I have been hiding and have been trying so hard. I am so tired and I feel hopeless and helpless. I have tried everything, I can’t get a job because I don’t have experience, no connection and not good enough. I prepared a lot for a perfect CV and cover letters. Employers hire someone with horrible attitude, or can’t even speak english that makes sense, but just not me. Friends come to be to vent, anytime they want something, they come to me. I have been trying to get a life. I can’t move house because I can’t afford it, I starve because I am trying to save money to survive. Mushrooms growing in the house, water leaking for months, cannot move out because I can’t find anywhere else I can afford to move, or landlord rejects me because I don’t have a job. Landlord continues to push the repairs and not doing anything. Council/government sector doesn’t seem to care no matter how much I call or email them. Parents don’t even call me or ask about me. I am a foreigner in UK, I have tried so hard the past 4 years. I am just building the courage to kms, and end this life. Anyone that knows about my situation says that’s horrible. Not even my family or parents care, why would others care? Unless Im Pretty, Rich or Dead. I can only choose to be dead ig.Forgive me for venting here, this is the only place I have left with.

Like the school psychiatrist has asked me about my self-harm and stuff and even asked if there's anything I want to tell but I can't just tell that I've actually planned to kill myself someday since like 11years old even for like no reason and how much I actually want to die and how I'll possibly kill myself as soon as I move out so my family doesn't have to see it. I don't understand why life is so difficult. Everything is. Socialising, staying healthy, going to school even just being and doing nothing is difficult. I feel stupid I can't do anything at school and I can't concentrate at school and I used to get good grades without studying (I mean I still pass without studying which is enough for me) but now even doing the school work makes me just so exhausted and makes me feel stupid and lazy that I can't even do that.  Everything feels too much and I don't understand why am I so lonely but everytime I have a chance to get friends I just can't even talk to them and my social battery runs out too fast. Sometimes talking to even family is difficult and everything feels weird and even clothes feel annoying and every noise hurts. I'm not even goid at drawing anymore which was only thing I was good at. This is just super messy vent because I'm stressed and anxious rn. I've been really wanting to kill myself for few days. Like more than usually I do. Searched ways to die again for a whole night. I know I won't kms I can't even do that. Maybe I should just walk ny river and drown myself, the automatic panicking doesn't sound that nice but I'm sure I'd die before anyone could save me at least. Good thing I don't have to walk homw from school because I fear I'd feel horrible just then and end up actually jumping in the river when passing it. Sometimes I just fear I kill myself at home because it'd be horrible for my family to find me dead.

(im sorry if youre reading this?)  this made me get a heavy fucking fear of loosing more people, ive become overly careful with what i say and always add a ""you dont need to if you dont want to"" / ""you can also just say no"" to everything i ask for.    work is going awful, my contract is not getting extended after my apprenticeship, so to add the cherry ontop of all the studying i need to do, i need to apply for jobs...  Im also always late atm, i used to arrive at 8AM each day, now i arrive at like 8:50-9:30, my boss already sent me messages because of this.  i cannot sleep, no matter how hard i try;    i dont want medication, neither a therapist or psychologist.

Thus screaming at me each day, controlling where i am at, not wanting me to play games at all atm, idk.  Recently got scammed for 40€ online for trying to buy heavier drugs, this shit fucked me up heavily.  Suicidal Thoughts are really bad atm, used to have passive ones, now active and passive ones.  Idk, if youre gonna comment, dont tell me to get professional help, its gonna make things worse especially atm, since id probably need to quit my job and end my apprenticeship which are gonna be 3 years wasted then. My parents would be dissapointed and theres no way in hell id be able to keep it a secret from them, they even sometimes follow me around when i go out.    and ik its gonna get better, dont need to say that. theres good and bad but so far my life has been bad, filled with alot of joyful moments, just currently all the worst events are being thrown at me which i cannot handle anymore    i dont do self harm unless my psychological pain is too heavy (usually turns into chest pain and then i get a ""panic attack""?) (only happened thrice, so probably dont worry about this, i dont even cut deep, no scars)  if ive had a painless way to commit, i wouldve done it already  Thanks for the listeners if there are any.

I just wouldn’t call it trauma as other people have had it a lot worse than me. Makes sense in my head. Ive been feeling more determined by the day. Each week i do more and more “research”. I just feel so sad, any little thing that requires the most minimal effort i just dont want to do it, i cant it takes too much mental strength . I try to not act super different with fam/friends when im feeling really low but sometimes i cant help it. I was really close to a couple of days ago, but something stopped me. I just feel like i need one moment of bad stress and that will break me. Im an incredibly weak person as well as just negative. Theres nothing i do or want to do to better myself. No one can help me. Im only a little scared but feel really guilty and scared for those close to me, the aftermath.

1c64hf1;Can not even get a response even on a sucide chat confirming the world does not me any more;Valuable_Hedgehog989;Life is never easy but as I get older I find life stop giving you new things or new love or desires but rather my passion for life and for  emptiness that has filled my life for the last 5 years after the lost my partner which truly changed me only finding the current man I am  only a shadow of my former self blending into the back ground being  not noticed anyone hardly being able to talk verbally to many people face to face. I have desperately reached out to my sisters and family  few times and  just get driven to the hospital but I am not wanting medical treatment I am just wanting someone to want me around and talk to me even though I do not talk back much but I am  so lonely and empty inside I just want peace in my brain an not to feel so trapped . I reached out to mates I thought were my friends an told them of my struggles and that was the last time I ever heard from any of those friends . I have had one friend stick by me an his brother an no one else calls or replied to my many messages till I gave up. I use to go fishing all the time but now I am lucky to get out once a year with a mate no one have time for me like they use to have. So the only conclusion I can come to is I must be a bad person that no one can stand being around. I attended my uncles funeral today he was a very nice guy always a smile and  smoke in his hand only very good memories with him thinking back I can still recall those very good times from when I was young. Leaving the funeral my two sisters walked by an I got my only word spoken in the last year was hello as they walked past I do not know maybe I should be grateful they even  acknowledge me. So I have just finished my will an got it certified an witnessed payed for my funeral arrangements  an security with instructions not to let my sisters  an the people  that I though  were my mates but only had me around while I propped them all up volunteering with work around there house or just activity’s with the family’s an groups  of friends but when I had something that devastated me I found only one person would be there as a friend. Sorry my parents are the best in the world an the last few years money has been very tight for them in the past few years. I find there to be more up side to me taking my own life rather then living on. My parents would receive all my superannuation it’s not millions but it would easily see out there retirement a they would be able to do as much travel as they like with the sale of the house aswell.  . I do not think there is much that could change my my mind but I feel like I am in so much pain felling. forgotten about from peoples lives apart from my mum and dad I do not think I will be missed and if they ever read this I could or ask for more loving parents that I know would do everything they could for me  but the pain and loss  that I find I can not get past. I hung my self 5 years ago I felt no pain but I was cut down by my neighbour that saw me jump off balcony. I look back and  feel that was the only peace I have had on the past 5 years  an just contemplating the method at moment;Life is never easy but as I get older I find life stop giving you new things or new love or desires ;;8;2;2024-04-17 08:17:13;2024-04-17;Wednesday;08:17:13;3103;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-19 13:34:14.444573

I’ve tried to end it all 2 times since the last week but I’m just too scared and I can’t seem to do it. But my pain is reaching a tipping point and I feel like I might pull the trigger tonight. The root of all problems is that I cannot accept myself or the way I look to be specific. I started hurting myself because I never felt good enough, there’s always someone better looking out there and even though I tried to tell myself that I’m enough, my inner demons just got the better of me. I’d spend countless hours crying alone, having to friends or anyone to talk to. My girlfriend cheated on me for two years straight and that further added to my trauma. And when I did find the love of my life, I pushed her away due to certain circumstances that I could have avoided easily. Things are so bad that I can’t even go out in the public without getting a panic attack and crying uncontrollably. I’m a terrible person and I want to get better, I really tried but no matter what I do, I won’t be able to be the best in the world or change whatever has happened. Is there a way to deal with self-doubt and constant self-hatred? I really don’t want to hurt myself anymore but I can’t stop doing it. I’ve spoken to a professional and that only made things worse because of an argument that I had.

We've been together for about 10 months and I have never felt so alive or at peace as I do when I'm with him. But it's long distance for the time being, since my college is an 8 hour drive away. I haven't even told him I'm suicidal. He knew about my anxiety pretty early on, as that's something I'm actually comfortable sharing with people for some weird reason. I've definitely hinted at the depression but never had a super serious talk about it. And I can't even think about telling him I want to end my life sometimes. I don't even know how he'd react.Honestly, he's the only reason I made it through last summer. I had plans to kill myself after I graduated high school, but then I met him. He changed things. But I'm so afraid of losing him or him breaking up with me, because then I won't have any reason to stay alive.I know it's not good to prop your entire life up against a person, but it's either that or I have nothing to live for and thus won't. Tonight I had a panic attack and an awful breakdown. I cried and hyperventilated and shook in a shower stall for a long time. I had told my partner earlier that I was having a tough time lately (I was super vague, just mentioned I felt like crying), but he didn't really offer help and I don't want to be a burden and ask.My mind was swarming with bad thoughts and I could not control them. I'm so afraid of these thoughts because I know they could lead to action. I want to die, I suffer so much. But I just can't do it because I'll hurt people. Many people love me.How do I fix my head? I fundamentally think and interact with the world different than almost everyone. It feels like I wasn't made to live in this world, like all the systems don't fit with me. I've been in college for almost a year and have no friends. My old friends from high school aren't there for me anymore. I've got no one I feel like I can reach out to.(Sorry if I rambled. The anxiety thoughts are like a revolving carousel right now.);I've been suicidally depressed since probably sixth grade.

";Unusual-Cow-7163;"I have been struggling with my mental health the past couple years. Last year took a turn for the worse. My wife lost our baby early in her pregnancy.  Was struggling to make sense of my life in a dead end job.

My wife, who's very headstrong and Type A , tells me to snap out of it.I  enrolled into online courses for school to keep me occupied. This way I can keep my depression  at bay.Then one day my wife and I start arguing for no apparent reason, and she tells me it was ""my fault"" our family is the way it is, and that God didn't give us a baby is because I didn't do my job  as the man of the house. You should just kill yourself.""I told her I would go to therapy and try to fix myself, even take medication to help my mental illness.To be honest, I've contemplated just ending my life the past several months, but the thought of leaving my young daughter behind keeps me from doing it.Even now I'm balling out as I write this.

The family I was born into, every single one of them, the decisions I made about my life and career, I even lost the will to fucking continue this abomination of a life like 2 years now.

So in this peaceful place on the bench I take off my belt and start wrapping it around my neck and I felt this sense of finality when I did it, I drew a few nice long breaths before tightening it on my neck and I was listening to some music too while at it but as I kept increasing the strenght of the belt on my neck I started to look up at the stars  and they were so beautiful, I felt this acceptance within me, I started blacking out and suddenly I get a phone call its like 1:30 am mind you and I had to stop my whole thing my mind like snapped and it still took me a while to be able to move and then untie the belt on my neck but I somehow did and I answered the phone call and went back to my place but since then I've been feeling a little numb and my neck hurts  but I talked to a friend about it and after saying what I did to myself out loud I had to say I needed to go take a piss but I was just crying because only after it came out of my mouth and how my friend reacted I realized how truly guilty I feel about doing that to myself since then, I like feel like a different person like sometimes I think something from within me actually died that day like I also feel something still around my neck Im 20 I don't wanna do it again I just want to rest rn just to clear my mind a bit;I spent a night thinking about how my life is going, I felt pretty damn low so I decided to just let;;0;6;2024-04-17 05:54:12;2024-04-17;Wednesday;05:54:12;2162;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 21:05:25.370823

1c61ou3;My choices left me with nothing. ;BuzzedAldrin420;Only now that it's too late. I realise that I never did anything right. Or treated my partner the way I should've. My selfish thoughts led me here. I didn't do anything for them in our entire 7 years. I don't even think I treated them as a friend. It took me losing the only one I care about and the only person I had to come to my senses. I fought against moving with them to a new city where they got a new job. I was hesitant but I supported them going. I stayed because I wanted to stay with what was familiar to me, without knowing that I always wanted to move. I have only regrets. After 2 years of being in a long distance relationship we grew apart and now we are done. I can't move there now. Now I'm left in my hometown, my family moved away, I have no friends, a job I don't think I'll have for much longer and an empty house with not even memories of our relationship to keep because I never saw past myself enough to do anything together. It onky dawned upon me when I tried to delete our photos together, I found that after 7 years we had so few memories and moments. And it was all my fault.I did nothing for my partner in 7 years and now that they've moved on, only now I see it. Every fibre of me wants to go back, to turn back the time. To have moved to a new city with my partner, to have done the things they wanted to do with me. To listen to them when they reached out to me. To undo the wrongs I caused and the neglect I gave. Maybe things could've been different. Every day I want to go back and do things right. But It's too late now. I just want to give up because there's no more possibilities left. I can't turn back time, or change who I was. I used everyone and I never even noticed. I feel like I'm worthless. All I did was take, and never gave back. I burned every bridge I had without ever seeing it because I only saw myself. I ruined my life, I am the reason I'm left with nothing.

1c61muj;I'm closer to the end than I have ever been.;YuriPetrova;"I'm almost 30 and I'm a woman. I am diagnosed with severe treatment resistant depression and severe social anxiety. I wrote a suicide note. I proofread and revised it. It's basically perfect now and I'm scared. My fiance, I believe, is falling out of love with me. I understand why, I don't know how she loved me in the first place. I'm a broken person, my depression is seemingly untreatable, I have zero life skills, I'm currently unemployed and no place worth working at (ie being paid the bare fucking minimum) is responding to my applications. I've already ruined my body, and I'm an alcoholic drug addict. I'm sober right now but it never fucking lasts. Been about two weeks since I touched the shit hoping I would feel at least a bit better. I did at first, kind of a delusional confidence for a sober future. But now I'm here, alone, sobbing and contemplating driving to a lake and drowning myself. I have knives, I could cut my wrists, but I don't want to be found. I don't want anyone to see me. I just want to stop existing. My fiance doesn't deserve this. She deserves happiness, she deserves someone who can give her a wonderful life, and that person will never be me. I feel so fucking alone. I can't talk to my fiance about this anymore because I'm always too negative and it upsets her. My friends don't want to do anything with me. I barely talk to my family.  I am so alone, trapped in my own head, spiralling. I want to wake her up and tell her what's going on. I should have her drive me to the crisis center near here. But then what? Even if they can somehow ""fix"" me, it will never last. My depression never leaves. It's always here, always telling me I'm worthless. Telling me I'm better off dead. Telling me to just fucking do it already. If I had a gun, I'd take a fucking Uber or Lyft and go somewhere no one will find me and blow my fucking brains out.  I can't keep going on like this. I'm only hurting the people I am supposed to love. I don't even know if I feel love. I've always doubted, always thought I'm deluding myself into thinking I have the same feelings as everyone else. But I don't think I do. I am an empty, hollow shell of a person and all I do is ruin things. I have to admit something. The main thing stopping me from doing it right here, right now, with the knife in my lap, is my cat. He would never understand, it would hurt him more than I could ever fathom. His mother, the one who raised him, who cuddles with him every night, holding him in her arms, would be abandoning him in his eyes. One day I'm there, the next I'm not. He would never understand.  Every day I get closer and closer to committing. To finally pulling the metaphorical trigger. I wish I could just stop existing. I wish I could press a button and just be erased completely from existence, as if I never was born. I hate myself. I hate myself. I fucking hate myself. I deserve this, I'm a selfish, evil monster and I fucking hate myself. I'm so fucking alone. Every single fucking time I think I am getting better, this fucking happens. Why? Why does life feel like torture? I don't even want to be happy, I just want to be fucking okay for once in my worthless fucking life. Fuck. I don't even know why I'm typing this. Nothing anyone can say will help me, all I'm doing right now is forcing my pain onto those reading. I'm a fucking awful person. Why am I like this?  There's a good, fitting quote from my favorite piece of media ever. ""I don't want to be this kind of animal anymore!"" If I haven't been able to fix myself in 30 years, I don't think I ever can.";I'm almost 30 and I'm a woman.

1c602ni;Idk;ExcellentFold4357;I’m only 19 and I know I am so young and I should try to live my life to the fullest. But I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. When I look back to everything and even now I feel like nobody truly loves me. I just don’t know what else to do. I’m so generous and kind to my friends and all. Like those outside relationships don’t even matter to me now because of what is going on inside my family. I don’t know why everything fell apart. My mother got really sick when I was about 9 and I was constantly worried about her and when my dad would leave for work I’d beg him to stay and chase  after him. As years went by I stopped responding to my mother’s symptoms too and I feel like I’ve become so heartless. She always tells me that I deserve to burn in hell and all those things for being disrespectful when I am just trying to express my opinion. My dad blames my mom for leaving his parents to die in his country. And I always felt somewhere along those years he stopped loving me the same and I recently found out that it was after my grandparents death. Last week when my brother got arrested for some stupid reason he called and screamed at me for not staying at the police station and begging them to not take my brother. I told him calmly that they would’ve taken him anyway. Then he screamed at me saying “how can I feel anything for you? When you did not help to bathe your grandmother? You were in 5th grade and when I called you, you just sat there.”  And I wasn’t that surprised when he said that but it still hurt me so much because he confirmed what I’ve known all along, that he didn’t feel anything for me as his daughter. I already knew my mother didn’t love me like other mothers. So I came to realize that nobody is guaranteed to love you in this life not even your own parents. I didn’t know if my will to go on and live got any lower after that because it has been that way for so long. But yeah he screamed at me after that saying that I hate God because I don’t wear the headscarf. So I started wearing it after that day because he kept saying how he’s ashamed to even go near me when we’re outside since I look like a disbeliever. I dress modestly but do not cover my hair because I am just not used to it to be honest and I don’t feel like I deserve it since I am not very knowledgeable in my religion. And I was trying to convince myself that I did a good thing and I did but idk. Today I took it off and looked at the mirror and started crying because I have to wear it forever now. And I know it’s normal and will take some time to get used to. But I feel like I’ve lost myself completely. I want to block all of my friends and just keep existing I guess. I’ve always wanted to be with someone who truly cares about me just like everyone else. However, my parents and my whole moms side of the family wants me to marry my cousin. And I was 17 when I went to their country and they pressured me into talking with him. He’s the complete opposite of what I want. While all of my friends and my peers are going to college this year, I’ll be going back to my country. I am so scared that they’re going to try to marry my off and pressure me. I don’t think I’ll have the will to just keep going under those circumstances. I am truly truly tired. I feel like I’ll look back and regret that I have spent so many years being sad. I just want to feel something, anything but sadness. I prayed and asked God to just please kill me because I cannot do it myself since that would mean I would go to hell. I don’t want to continue living in hell. My dad has always criticized me for having dreams that do not align with his beliefs. Or even wanting to live a certain way. Now I look around people and I think that their lives are literally pointless from what my father has described. I am truly tired. My academic performance has been very very poor. My parents do not care about it since I am a “girl” and with all the friends I’ve had in the past and just everything I’ve been influenced by I missed out on some stuff. I remember I had so so so much potential and it hurts me so much that I’ve killed it. I do not have the energy or even the motivation to take control of my own life. The person that they want me to marry knows about how my personality is like this. That’s why he’s so insistent on marrying me so that he can mold me into his perfect little wife. I can’t even think about the kind of life that awaits me. I know many people have more experience in life than me. I honestly don’t even want to ask if things will get better because I feel like they wont since even my own future is not even in my hands. I don’t know what to ask for honestly.

1c5zq88;Does the self hate ever leave?;Chocoyun;The hate and despair you feel when you think about yourself in any capacity? That people would have a better life without you around? That you should really just cut everyone out already and live alone like you deserve to. To let them thrive and enjoy themselves without worry. I tried that recently but came crawling back to them like the pathetic parasite that I am. Suicide is the absolute permanent solution to this problem. No chance you can ever go back. I don't have any desire to do it since an attempt a while ago, but I like having this knowledge that it's a option with a definite outcome. But what does if feel like for you if you experience this? Do you feel the hands reaching through your body to squeeze your heart or throat?

1c5y8bw;It’s never going to “get better” for me. ;ophelia_fleur;I’m getting divorced. It’s messy and the law is on his side for no real reason right now. Just because of his job, which I guess makes sense. He’s hurt me in so many ways. I’m still in the middle of trauma therapy. It’s been a year since we separated and I still feel like it’s never going to be over. I’m drowning. He won’t pay spousal support and there’s nothing I can do. I can’t afford my attorney without it. He took years of my life away and I’m trying to pick up the pieces but it’s like none of them even fit together. He’s still hurting me and no one will help. The “resources” they say are out there? They don’t exist if your husband has the right job and the right people looking out for him. My advocate can call anyone until she’s blue in the face but somehow? He always wins. One year ago today, I started planning how I’d kill myself to get out of this relationship. I failed. I wish I hadn’t. I can’t tell anyone because then they’ll send me away and I really will lose everything. My options are to end it myself or let him bully me to death. He cut me off from everyone I know. Everyone I loved. The worst part is? The ones left, my own blood, blamed me and turned on me for leaving. Said I should have put up with the abuse because it meant stability. “Happiness.” I guess it’s a little late for me to figure out what that looks like.

1c5y720;Eyes wide open;Lanky_Wasabi7424;"Years ago, I was asked by a drunk stranger in a smokey bar what I thought my life was worth. It wasn't a veiled threat, but rather a philosophical question posed by a man who had too much to drink. Looking back, I'm sure he was fishing for some profound answer or perhaps even hoping to provoke an epiphany of sorts. I provided neither. Instead, I spit out a witty response. ""That depends on how much you're willing to pay for it, I suppose,""  I chuckled. ""What's your offer?""He seemed satisfied with my attempt at comic relief, and our brief interaction ended with my next beer on him. I am now decades removed from that moment, but if I were to walk into the same bar and be asked the same rhetorical question by the same man, my answer wouldn't be the same. It would be much more arbitrary. ""About four grand,"" I would reply. ""$3,800 to be exact.""That, my reddit friends, is what my life is worth or perhaps the more specifically the amount needed to make my life worth living. I'm not going to go into intricate details about what brought me to my present predicament because, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. And I'm not going to entertain the thought that my life will get better because it won't. And I am not soliciting financial advice because trust me when I tell you that I have exhausted every possible option nor am looking for handouts because I don't deserve any.  It is safe to say that I can not dig myself out of this hole. I have succeeded in burying myself figuratively. My only way out of it is to bury myself literally.I'm sure I will be told that ""Money isn't everything"" and be offered another proverbial anecdotes such as ""Money can't buy happiness"" or ""Where there is muck, there is brass."" I know money isn't everything. Honestly, I don't care much for it. I never have. I also know that money does not guarantee a good life, but it certainly helps. And I absolutely know you have to work for things in life. I would love more than to pull myself up by the old bootstraps this time, but, alas, I can not. So what's a middle-aged girl to do? Unless you've carried the weight of financial problems, you have no idea how heavy it is. It is crushing, in fact. And it is as daunting as it is cumbersome. I feel as if I spend most of my time on a tightrope, forced to take shaky steps and struggling not to plummet. I exist in a constant state of panic, unable to eat, unable to sleep, unable to breathe, really. I am suffocating. Sometimes, it feels I am being slowly snuffed out, as if I am running out of oxygen in an airtight vault. Other times, it feels like the air has been sucked out of my lungs in one sudden and violent jerk, as if I have been plunged into icy, artic waters. Either way, I am on the verge of asphyxiation, and I have no one to blame but myself. Sure, I have had bad luck, but I have also made bad decisions. And while I may not be solely responsible for my financial situation, I do hold myself most accountable, copping to the pivotal role I have played in it all. That perhaps is the most unbearable component of all, being cognizant that choice not chance led me here. I used to say that failure isn't the worst thing a person can live with, that regret is much, much more bitter pill to swallow. But I can tell you from experience that they are equally as wretched. I so wish someone in reddit land could swoop in save me, but the sad truth is, I can't be saved. I am irrevocably irredeemable and unrescuable. And frankly, even if I could be saved, I neither expect it or nor am I entitled to it. The ephiany that eluded me decades ago in that smokey bar, no longer does. My eyes are painfully wide open.";Years ago, I was asked by a drunk stranger in a smokey bar what I thought my life was worth.

My parents see my life as throwable waste. They have always threatened to kick me out. Even for the smallest reasons. Even after everything I've done for them. Currently I'm at my lowest in life. I don't know what to do for university and the constant pressure is significantly impacting my mental health. Their reminders only make it worse. In terms of chores I do my chores. I wash their dishes and cook rice, but they say that's a given. They nag me when they have to tell me to do a chore telling me that I'm a robot that has to be told what to do. Sometimes I do them by myself, but other times I don't bother. My mother is a housewife. She has no job. She used to, but she was bad at being a caretaker so she quit. She is lazy at times. She only cooks food when my dad is here. When my dad has the night shift, she doesn't cook dinner at all. And expects me to cook for me and my little brother. I get it I'm old. I can cook.But today was different. While I was cooking my early dinner, she said make sure to cook some for your brother. The dishes weren't washed the whole day and the only thing she cooked was not something my brother would eat. But that was too late, I go to the gym and currently I'm bulking. I eat alot. I said why didn't you cook for him? She snapped at me saying I can't ask you to cook? I complained saying that you should've told me you weren't going to cook so I would've prepared food for him too. She began hitting me with a cutting board saying it's a lot you can't share that? In the end I ended up sharing, but that wasn't the reason I was mad. The food I cook is quick and nearly bland. To compensate I gave my brother some mang thomas. He didn't finish his food. It was bland. And there was no other way to fix it because It was already fully cooked. She says she'll talk to my dad about this. And I'm pretty sure I'm getting kicked out given his mindset. I've always been hit, this is pretty common in asians households.  My dad has always been petty and had a fanatical way of looking at things. Sometimes overcomplicates things and makes me look like the bad guy. Somehow it's always me.  I've been depressed for years, and I always thought this was normal. Until I looked at the symptoms of depression and I fit. For years I've been like this. And I'm done. I miss the times when I was happy. I miss the philippines. And if I do kill my self. I'm thankful for all the good things that ever happened to me.;might get kicked out of the house soon.

1c5xapm;I don't have any fight left.;Cute-Emu7483;"Life has been an uphill battle for me. So much has happened, and so much is going on at once. Quickly, My mom had me young. She married my ""dad"" when I was in utero. They were divorced when I was 6 months old. Mom started dating my step dad immediately after and my brother came shortly too. Since I was 3, my mom had me competitively swimming. Getting into elementary school I had practice before and after school through high school. When I was 7, my mom got mad at my ""dad"" and told me he wasn't my biological father. It crushed me. From 7-12 I was molested by a family member and nobody ever listened. This person ended up going to prison for SA'ing a minor when they became of age. When I was 8, I watched my 3rd brother be born. Fast forward to the day after my 10th birthday, and that same brother (21 months old) fell in the pool. May 5th he passed, and it was my fault. I was in school when he fell in the pool but I always have carried that guilt, since I had a pool party. That was the first time I saw a dead body, and I held my baby brother when I went into the room with my priest and my ""dad"". This same year in 5th grade, I got ""Disney Dreamer and DOer"" as well as valedictorian. At 11, I tried to commit suicide the first time. I was begging God to let me switch with my brother, he should still be here. Middle school was hell. I was a popular kid, but regardless, it was still rough. I've never been one for drama, and thats all it was. Going into high school I started rebelling. My mom went on family vacas without me, and my ""dad"" got a new girlfriend. My ""dad"" also got married to this gf (+ 3 stepbrothers) where they were expecting my youngest brother. I tried a suicide attempt again because In my mind, my dad wouldn't love me anymore. Kinda goes together because he didn't always make it to my swim meets or extra curricular activities, and for my brother he never misses anything. Also at 15, my mom put me in a childrens home because she didn't want to deal with my depressive/rebellious behavior anymore. I spent Thanksgiving alone with the cook at the Childrens' home. Nobody came to visit me. While I was there, my dog that I had since I was 3-4 years old died. Wild. My mom switched me high schools, and thats when shit really hit the fan. I was introduced to drugs/alcohol and fighting. When I transferred schools, I also lost my virginity just because. It was nothing special. Met my baby daddy at 16, and I was arrested for fighting my mom and had to go live with my dad. Went back to my moms house and back to the high school I started out in. Dropped out the day I turned 18, and my mom also had my bags packed when I got home. I lived back and forth with friends and then I was hit in the head with a tree. I died, broke my C7, 7 skull fractures and an orbital fracture. I was in a coma for about a month. Sever TBI and nothing much was expected from it. However, a few months after I turned 19, I got my HS diploma, started college and got my CNA. Started working at the hospital. When I was 20, I got pregnant with my oldest. Apparently the money I was supposed to get from my brain injury (homeowners insurance) disappeared. Nobody knows where it went. So keep in mind, I'm still poverty poor. Baby daddy left me when I was about 6 months pregnant. No help, nothing. Got an IUD after he was born (can't have BC or anything with hormones). My body rejected the IUD. So now I'm 23. Tore my ACL and have it repaired (Cadaver). Little did I know I was pregnant with baby #2. Found out when I was 3 months along and I couldn't bring myself to an abortion. This pregnancy almost killed me, mentally and physically. The things going through my head were out of control. After my youngest' birth, they tied my tubes. I was super hard on myself because this is baby daddy #2, also. At 24, had two more surgeries. Medical Meniscus, back to back. Between losing my job (ER) to losing my fiance, and getting behind in college, I saved up my seroquel and OD'd. At this time, I had moved in with my grandma. She was out of town watching one of my brothers play college football. She came home and found me, about 16 hours after and I inhaled my vomit. EMS was called and my coworkers picked me up and took me to the ER where I worked at and they said I wasn't going to make it. Was intubated for almost 2 weeks. This wasn't documented as a suicide because I was doing army things. Later that year, I bailed and went to Fort Drum NY. Didn't tell anyone. My family didn't really care, if anything they antagonized my feelings of hopelessness and being alone. Keep in mind I live in a ""small town"" and I'm related to a lot of people. Right after I left. my mother got a hold of baby daddy number 2, and he came and got my youngest. He wasn't on the BC and never knew the kid. He somehow ended up on the BC without my knowledge, Thats when I decided to stay at Fort Drum. I was only supposed to be gone for a short time. Over all this, my grandma was the only one who cared and knew anything. When I was doing army hood rat things (reserves), I was finally over 21 (25 at this time) and without any obligations so I drank. Heavily. All the time. Resulting in two DUIS. I tried to bring my oldest up a few times, but without a support system it was beyond hard. My kids weren't around me when I was drinking. Thanksgiving 2018 was the last time I saw or spoke to my youngest and my grandma. My grandma passed Dec 23, and I haven't been able to cope since. She was my biggest and only supporter. My youngest' dad just doesn't want me to have contact at all. I did a county bullet to get out of a felony. When I was in there, I met the dude I eventually married. I was 29. Nobody called me in the jail, or visited. My family and friends were all in FL. I don't even think anybody knew I was in jail for the longest time. So everybody in the jail thought I was a cop. Undercover. Wondering why I had a southern accent, nobody knew me, I was always being pulled out in the middle of the day (army), and I had privileges. Oh and all my teeth. There was a college class offered there, and I was the TA for the inmates. Thats where I met my now ex-husband. He was the safety blanket because he was the worst one in the jail and was well known. I also was able to see him in person 5x's a week. I got out and he gout out a month after me. We dated and were fine for about 6 months after that, so having been together a little over a year. We got married in June of 2020 when Covid hit. I also started a graduate program. I went home (back to FL) a couple days after we were married and when I got back to NY, he overdosed in front of me. This is when my life started sinking fast. I tried to help him. I had no idea about those kinds of drugs or the lifestyle. He was an IV heroin user. My money started missing, my belongings, the physical abuse and the lies. I moved back to FL, and got my own place. He followed. He was doing alright when he first got here was able to get him a job with my family. However, he started using again. I got him Marchmans acted and that just fueled the fire because then he was able to meet dealers/heroin users. At this time I had my oldest full time (2021) and I filed a custody case for my youngest. I was my oldest' baseball coach, and we were always together. We never were at my house because of my (ex) husband always being high. I was in crossfit pretty heavy and also was finishing my Masters (May 2022). In June of 2022, I filed for divorce and shit hit the fan. My ex husband did whatever he could to sabotage me. My oldest went to stay with my step dad because the abuse was out of control. I was arrested a few different times, for kicking him off my porch (ex husband) and I was arrested for his drugs. I'm the only one on the lease and I called the sheriff to get him out of my house because of his drugs. They couldn't verify who's drugs they were but since it was my home I was arrested. Sheriffs couldn't remove him from my home, or wouldn't. A few days before this arrest for the POC, my ex husband OD'd me. He put something in my drink and next thing you know he couldn't narcan me back. He called EMS and again, people I knew came. These people knew I was trying to get away from him, and one of them is my good friend. This good friend was trying to figure out what happened especially since my ex husband was pacing while saying ""I didn't mean to do it, I didn't mean to do it"". Was taken to the ER I used to work at years before, and they released me. I wasn't marchmans acted because they all know I don't do drugs. During all this, I had a job as a substitute as well as worked at another facility (Advent). I resigned from both jobs. DCF now is involved because of the arrest. Oh, I'm also in a PhD program. CJ/Behavioral health. The poss. charge ended up being dropped. DCF required me to do all the evaluations without finding anything mentally wrong. Also did SA evals as well as random drug screens for a year and a half. Passed every one, and no SA issues. I also was arrested a few more times for driving on a suspended license, regardless of the paperwork I had to say otherwise. Had insurance, tag, title and registration all only in my name (through USAA). Last November after all this, I had a mini stroke. I've taken off from school. DCF placed my oldest with my parents, and they couldn't follow court orders so they placed him in foster care. I got an injunction and a divorce in 2023. Ex husband just got out of jail for violating the injunction twice. DCF also got my oldest' father involved, who was absent for 10+ years, and reversed the order where he signed over his rights. I asked for family therapy because of the trauma the both of us went through and witnessed. Because I challenegd the DCF workers and cursed them to no end, they went to an emergency hearing where instead of unsupervised visits, they ordered therapeutic visits for one hour, once a month. The last time I talked to my oldest was last May (2023). So with all this, heres the issues I'm facing now.....I had court for my oldest last Thursday. His dad wants child support from me, and I have never received a dime. My oldest went to him over the summer. They moved him two counties away. I still can't drive. I told my mom to never speak to me again, given she doesn't do a thing to help but always tells me ""Not my problem"", ""I'm not discussing this with you"",etc etc. I can't get a job to save my life, granted I'm related to the whole damn town and my resume is too extensive. Plus, with this suspended license charge over my head, I won't pass a background. My youngest' dad has dragged this out too and both baby daddies are doing the same thing to me in courts. I'm not taken classes again because I can't afford it, let alone barely pay my necessity bills. I have no friends. A lot of the friends I had, had kids also. Without kids, I have nothing. People my age single without kids go to bars, and I don't care to drink or hang out there. My family is all around me, and I don't get invited to anything. Holidays, birthdays, etc. Shit, my brother got married in November and it was apparently made to me that I was not allowed. I'm the only sister. I honestly have nobody. My self sabotage is through the roof. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Music, I turn off because I shouldn't be allowed to enjoy that. TV, same. My whole family is wealthy. Like, stupid wealthy. Won't even lift a finger to take me to the store. They live right around the corner. I've come to the conclusion, I am an awful person. I must have done something so asinine that nobody is willing to be in my corner. I never abused, neglected or abandoned anyone. (My kids were with my grandma when I went to NY, my mom showed up one day and decided to pull the plug). There is no making anything right. I can't deal with this life anymore. There is no purpose, promise or silver lining. In any direction. I've tried to fight. This isn't mental illness either. This is circumstantial. I'm not willing to wait years for this to ""get better"" where I will have a young adult come to my door asking me ""why?"" and they've developed mental issues on their own. On a side note, my animals love me and thats whats hurting the most. I have a mustang who was abused and didn't like any human until he came to me. My dog won't leave my side.  1) nobody will miss me when I'm gone 2) it will be a relief of a burden to many 3) I will be at peace for the first time in my life 4) I don't want to get old and decrepit, and be stuck on a bench 5) I wont hear ""You aren't my problem"" or ""You aren't my kid"" anymore.This isn't a cry for help, but a paper trail. Good night";Life has been an uphill battle for me. So much has happened, and so much is going on at once.

1c5wxkf;I did it to myself ;BeautifulEarth8311;I was a heavy drinker for many years masking undiagnosed autism, trying to fit in, not seeing consequences for my peers so expecting none for me. It was bad enough how I must up the exterior of my life-lost jobs, opportunities, relationships, consequences but then the interior became a prison I can no.longer exit. First it was just detox and I remember the superhuman relief when finally liberated. It was a better high than drinking. Then it was hospitalizations because I couldn't safely tiugh it out on my own anymore. Alcohol became a prison. The thing with alcoholism is that it sneaks up on you. Eventually you cannot let your back drop or you go into detox while still drunk. You beg for a drink. Rationally knowing this isn't a logical plan but desperately trying to to stave off the detox symptoms that feel like hell on earth and may kill you. The last time I drank I knew I would never touch the stuff again. I was so totally abd completely over it. I had so many good things lined up just waiting to be seized but on that fateful day I foolishly picked up my drink locking myself into a month long binge. Maybe longer. I don't know. I tried to get treatment but the hospital refused me meds because of the opioid crisis. What that has to do with an alcoholic trying to detox I'll never understand. That one decision by hospital staff sealed my fate. I had to keep drinking until, in my alcoholic stupid, I found a place forty five minutes away that would medically detox me. I do remember calling the same lady several times because I couldn't remember what I was doing. She was the only one to show me any kindness and gently remind me I had already called and give me the information again. All because the hospital in my city wouldn't detox me I ended up on an overnight month long bender only to finally land in the hospital with several inflamed organs. The doctor preferred I stayed inpatient for detox but I was drunk and I hate hospitals so I said if he was fine with me detoxing at home I would prefer it. Probably a stupid decision though I'm not sure he would have treated me better inpatient. Inpatient detox is hell. You are trapped in a hospital bed in a loud, extremely cold hospital sweating out your withdrawals and usually restricted on medication to only give you enough to fend of death seizures but not enough to actually starve off symptoms. That's why I preferred to go home. At least I could turn the heat up. Take a shower. Have more than one shaggy prison blanket. The detox was hell. I couldn't seem to pull out of it. I finally did only after having my entire life collapse around me. But, the symptoms slowing creot in until I was completely disabled. I felt my nervous system meeting but had no idea how to explain this to any doctor. And I figured if I did they would just write it off to anxiety, which they did. I asked for nutritional testing, which they denied and told me diet would somehow correct the obviously severe deficiencies I was now experiencing. I tried alternative doctors to only receive incorrect treatments and worse reactions and symptoms. I eventually began treating myself. But, of course, a severe deficiency that melts your nervous system is no easy thing to pull out of. The reactions to therapy became worse than the illness. At least as bad and now, five years later, I'm still disabled. My nervous system is still messed up. Doctors still write it off to anxiety even with my medical history and I feel backed into a corner. I felt suicidal for years. I couldn't figure out how to do life or even enjoy it. I guess I'm a cliche because since this illness I have so much live for life. I desire it. I don't want to die. But I have no quality of life. Not only do I not have any quality of life but my body is a literal torture chamber. I feel like I'm trapped in alcohol detox hell permanently. I guess that's my karma if you believe in that sort of thing. I'm just heartbroken that now that I finally want life I may have to leave it. Abd I'm terrified of that prospect. My faith brings me comfort in this life but, honestly, I'm like anyone else and I have my doubts. I also have my fears. What if there is a hell and I send myself there? Or, perhaps worse, I muck it up and end up in even worse shape in this life. I don't even know how to do it. I have no plans. I feel so trapped abd scared and I just have to go through each day like this day in and day out. If you've read this far I hope you find a reason for living. Life is actually beautiful. Even though it's hard.;I was a heavy drinker for many years masking undiagnosed autism, trying to fit in, not seeing conseq;;0;3;2024-04-17 01:08:05;2024-04-17;Wednesday;01:08:05;4549;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 21:05:26.694508

1c5wnzj;Anti freeze and energy drinks ;Advanced-Isopod4955;"I am dying tonight. There are people in my life who love me (which is more then I can ask) so I can’t talk to anyone in my real life about this I’m not really sure why I’m typing this now maybe I just need to someone to know I was here, that I tried.I’m 23F at the age of 7-9 I was molested and raped by my biological father. (no longer in contact haven’t been since I was 9) the first few times it happened I made sure my mom knew because as ‘normal’ as my father tried to convince me the acts were it still always felt wrong, she either didn’t believe me or maybe was just too young to know what to do either way I’ve forgiven her and we’ve moved on from it At the age of 16 I met a man who was 25( he was a lier but we’ll get into that) at first he was perfect gentle and caring with me. in the moment I didn’t realize how mean he got but looking back on it I know where I should’ve walked away (the beginning) he’d take care of me, feed me, spend money on me, then he’d beat me and when I’d pass out he’d rape me . I didn’t know what a dom/sub relationship was at the time but that’s what he made us (he wasn’t a real dom just a man who enjoyed hurting the people who love him) we were together longer then I’m proud to admit but during the relationship I got pregnant, when I told him he panicked and flipped on me blaming it on me cheating (really he was scared of going to jail) he beat me again hoping to force a miscarriage it didn’t work but that was the one that put things into perspective for me, I didn’t feel worth the breath that filled my lungs but now I was making life, I was doing something beautiful and wonderful and sinless I thought I’d done something so good and still he put his hands on me. After that I left it wasn’t that simple though he would never leave me alone, about a week later I ended up miscarrying At 17 after suffering my first misscarge I tried to take my own life obviously failed my family found me and I was put on suicide watch 24/7 and therapy three times a week I slowly got better I graduated highschool and went to college it wasn’t easy and I ended up leaving that program for another where i graduated and at 19 I start a career in healthcare making the most of my friend group with my own apartment and car debt free at 21 At 22 I met my fiancé(25 at the time) I didn’t pay much attention to men until I realized just how lonely having peace was is gotten so used to being alone that the quiet stopped bothering me but still like anyone else I wanted my person Que my fiancé, we met in that time When I didn’t want anyone but he never missed an opportunity to ask me out I’d turned him down multiple times until finally we met, we spent hours together talking and laughing hours and hours having a good time by the time we parted ways that night he’d asked me to be his girlfriend and I went with it, we spent everyday after that one together enjoying each other, we got engaged after our 6 month anniversary (fast Ik) and we were madly in love we decided to wait to get married just because I wasn’t ready. November 23 2023 he left home with his bestfriend ‘S’ (28M) to meet another bestfriend ‘A’(28M) to preform and party at a club downtown  (all three grew up together) and never returned, he was shot in the back of the head by ‘A’ over a fight they’d had three months prior paramedics said he was dead before his body hit the ground, that it all happened so fast he just dropped. Another friend ‘R’  tried to give him CPR but said his eyes where already rolling back in his head. He was gone It’s now been 4 months since he died and I’m tired, I’ve picked myself up and dusted myself off before but now many more times can I hurt in this life time before I’ve hurt enough.So tonight’s the night Ive got about 12oz of antifreeze and a couple energy drinks(no real reason just better flavors then soda) that take the bitterness away a bit hopefully that’ll be enough I don’t need anyone to tell me there are people who love me, believe me I know and I hope they can find it in them selves to forgive me I just needed to get it off my chestTL;DR:My life is fucked so I’m leaving thanks for coming to my TED talk one love ✌🏽";I am dying tonight.

1c5w3w0;Exhausted;burneraccountanon000;I (28F) am so, so tired of living. I am so tired of waking up every day. On the surface I have it together - graduate degree with no debt, good job, money in the bank, physically fit, close to my grandparents and sibling, friends, hobbies, plans to travel. I have worked so hard to get here.And I am still so tired.My mom died when I was 10. My dad became abusive immediately after and spiraled into drugs and alcohol and women. He spent all of the money my mom left my sibling and I and then some. I stayed quiet about the abuse for years under threat of what he’d do to my younger brother, but we wound up in foster care for the next five years anyway. Too little too late for me, I think it saved my brother.My boyfriend of 5 years recently broke up with me, in part because of how much I was relying on him for my own self worth. I knew I was doing this, esecially toward the end, but I couldn’t stop. There is something fundamentally wrong and twisted in me. The breakup still stings, but the bigger problem is it has sent me right back to being 15 years old in a group home regaling yet another court ordered professional of the assaults and abuse and not knowing whether I’d be sent right back to my dad (again) or to another home (again). I can’t live with this. I have tried. I have tried so hard. My brother doesn’t need me anymore. My grandparents would be okay without me. I am so, so tired of waking up and feeling him. It never goes away. I’m always back to being this unwanted, twisted child that ruins everything around me. It’s always there, crippling me even after everything I have fought for.Please let me go.;I (28F) am so, so tired of living. I am so tired of waking up every day.

1c5v3xp;I’m going to kill myself soon;Future_Interest5847;Hello everyone, my name is TJ and you don’t know me but the things I’m about to say will change how you see me. For the last few months I’ve been struggling with a bad breakup of my long term ex. If that wasn’t enough I went down a deep depression where I’ve started failing in school and barely cleaning my room. But my friends were there for me. They had me going to church every Wednesday and I spent most of my time with them every week. But of course I begin to ruin it all. Around a week or two ago, my best friend ex had kissed me. And of course I developed feelings after that and I had asked for us to be romantically involved. She said no due to the fact I was her ex best friend and that she doesn’t want any drama. I of course kept asking for severs days for us to be a couple before giving up. We both agreed that this would never get out and left it at that.And now what just recently happened 4 days ago. I was invited by my female friend (’ll call her B) to her female friend house (I’ll call her K) to spend the night. We had ended up getting super high and B had smacked my dick twice. While under the influence I had thought that, that means I could get touchy. So we had ended up watching a movie and I had begun to start touching her sexually. And she didn’t move me or seem uncomfortable at the time. But she was beginning to fall asleep. But I had tried to wake her up and she didn’t move at all. So I had stop touching her and moved to the opposite side of the couch. Every few seconds she would move subtly towards me and I had begun touching her again and she wouldn’t move at all. This repeated like 3 times. So I had whipped my dick out and had put it in her mouth. I had them ejaculated in her mouth. Around 3 minutes later she had woke up and went to the bathroom. Then she had texted K that she was feeling sick and needed tampons (also B was my ride) so a few minutes later my friend (we can call him R) had texted me and told me it’s time to go home. He had order me an Uber and that was that. I immediately woke up and realized the mistake I made and had texted B that I was deeply sorry and I don’t know what had came over me. She had said I had betrayed her trust and that I’m disgusting (which was true). I had later found out she had told my friends what had happened and they begun to text me and telling me they are no longer associated with me. I had texted B and offer to turn myself in at our local department. She had refused as she was already involved with the police on a separate matter.What’s worse is that R had found out what went down with me and his Ex and now intended to fight me For the last few nights I’ve barely sleeper (longest was 3 hours) due to the fact I feel an immeasurable guilt and shame for what I’ve done. I’ve never looked at B that way and have never done that to anyone. In a few days I plan on killing myself by taking a bunch of pain killers and walking into the street.

1c5uzqe;Really long vent/rant;Prior_Mammoth784;"I have no idea what this is, I'm just ranting and yapping about random things here.Feel free to read if you want..I just want to get this off my chest, if it helps.I had an argument with my mom about not wanting to go back to school a couple days ago.My father is currently depressed, due to guilt and stress. I feel that it's also because of me, I have trauma from him and this leads me to sometimes be irritated at the thought or sight of him, sometimes I feel guilty for it but I don't understand why I feel irritated all the time around him.I yelled that I had to struggle and mask my depression for 4 years, and that I was exhausted of acting like I was fine. I think I've had depression longer than 10. (I'm 14 years old)I have had 4 suicidal attempts, none led to the hospital, but my parents are aware of them.I struggle at school, I can't focus, I've never been able to focus. I used to be called a gifted kid, now I can barely keep myself and my grades together. I'm in an advanced program in highschool, mostly to develop future scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and anything related.I struggle with math, but I don't recall anything from childhood. It feels blank, like a missing piece I'm my memories. As I mentioned, I have trauma from my father. Teaching me math, he didn't hit me, but would yell at me. I struggle retaining basic facts, I still count with my fingers, I still haven't memorized my multiplication table, I struggle reading analog clocks. I have a memory from my father had once grabbed my chin and forced me to look at him. My older brother was hit when I was being taught at hid age which means ""I didn't have it worse"" I guess.Sometimes my brain rewrites things. I remember telling my parents about my suicide attempt, leading to them taking me to the doctor, and then after a couple sessions...anti-depressants (Zoloft). I apparently only remember my mom stopped buying pills after I ran out. This is from my own memory.But after an argument with my mom, she told me she asked me if I felt stable now and that I told her I felt fine and that I didn't need to be on medication anymore. After telling me, I suddenly remembered that what she said was true.Another random thing I remember..When me and my older brother get into arguments, it's always about how my tone or the way that I spoke felt disrespectful or mean or rude.I don't understand why, I'm not even sure what I said wrong most of the time and after noticing this pattern, I try to be the calm one in situations. I don't understand why it doesn't work.Back to the present.I feel...disconnected from them (my family) but I feel guilty about all the things they have done for me. I feel like I have to repay them for simply providing for me.They are...good people. It's not like they abused me and hit me..but I'm not actually sure what went wrong with me and why I'm like this.I feel guilty that they had to have someone like me, I feel like I'm not even a real person anymore and that I'm a hollow shell of a person. I want nothing more than to kill myself and leave this world early.The funny thing is, I have certain things I keep up with:I love DC, I love the Batfamily the most and I feel an attachment to them.(Although I don't have a huge collection of Comics I've read unfortunately, most of my knowledge about DC is through research and curiosity, I haven't really read through Comics  as I somehow can't focus on it.)I've been like this for 2 years now though and I don't remember how it started.My favorite character is Jason Todd.Before DC though, was Marvel. To be specific, the MCU ( for the most part, I sometimes would dabble on the Comics).My knowledge is to the extent of the MCU though, unlike DC, which is probably more detailed in my opinion. I plan on researching more about it...if I'm still alive by then.My favorite character is Bucky Barnes.I also like Spider-Man, but specifically, it's Spider-Man 2099, Miguel O'Hara.As I've mentioned, I feel very attached to the mentioned...interests? To the point where I insert myself to the universe, in my imagination. I get so lost in these that I sometimes feel like I'd rather be imagining these instead of reality.I don't particularly make mine have good origins, I sometimes take parts of my favorite character's origins and combine them to make mine.(I'd write an example, but I've been typing for about 15 minutes now and I have no idea what I'm even doing.)";I have no idea what this is, I'm just ranting and yapping about random things here.Feel free to read;;1;1;2024-04-16 23:38:19;2024-04-16;Tuesday;23:38:19;4431;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-19 13:34:16.418945

1c5uv35;Extremely disconnected to everything and everyone ;Frequent_Mess_3900;The brain fog is so brutal, and so embarrassing. Sometimes I can’t process even the simplest of information, as if I’ve popped into existence/consciousness as a fully grown adult only a few days ago. I really need to connect with others, but I’m not capable of it in my current mental state. I am so disconnected to everything around me, it’s extremely painful. I recently dated a beautiful man, but my brain fog was so strong I could not be present with him at all, so he rejected me. I made myself look so bad and so stupid. Having a really good relationship would actually save me but I’m too fucked up to be present enough to ever develop that with someone.I have little to no interest in pursuing much of anything. If I ever do pull that off myself, that interest goes away. It’s completely pointless for me to pursue any interest because sooner than later, the interest is completely gone. Thinking about pursuing anything at all only fills me with fear and dread. I always end up disappointed with myself. Why can I not be normal and keep any interest?I also don’t have any friend to lean on… the lack of connection to others makes everything so much more painful. I feel so incapable of developing a good friendship, because my mind is extremely messy and sensitive. It’s very cluttered and empty at the same time.All I have are my immediate family members, but it’s so embarrassing letting them in on my emotional suffering. Opening up to them about this also brings them pain… it’s like I have to be selfish and break their hearts for them to know what I’m going through and maybe get me the help I need, because I sure as fuck can’t save myself.It’s very likely I will not receive the help I need, and I will resort to suicide. I may actually do the most painful thing against myself and the few people who love me, to end my very long-term suffering. What is the point of going on existing when you’re hurting so much and for a seemingly endless amount of time? What is the point when you really try saving yourself so many times, but you just fucking can’t?Suffering with long-term (undiagnosed) depression has turned me into a significantly dumber person. I would absolutely not survive without my family. I also feel too far gone, like I’m at an irredeemable point. Like suffering for so many years has caused enough brain damage that I will never be a normal person. I genuinely believe this.I need serious help.If anyone wants to talk please let me know;The brain fog is so brutal, and so embarrassing.

1c5tz6y;Im losing my mind. I cant handle the pain much longer.;AMOURGAY;"Hi everyone. Sorry for the extremely long post, or if any of this sounds weird or contradicting, but I've been struggling with these thoughts for months, and it's been getting worse. I really feel that this is the only place where I can let things out.I can't help but feel that life just seems all painful and morbid and that it's all just one big competition that we cant trust each other in, so I feel that everyone only acts in their own interests. That in addition to knowing that for someone to win, there has to be someone else who eats the mud and gets labelled a loser just makes me feel horrid. and that no one really cares or listens. Because of that, I fear that by opening up to people I know in person, because I'm going to be vulnerable, and someone is going to take advantage of that. Knowing that some people are living miserable lives; whether they suffer from terminal illnesses, are in debt, or are homeless, that others died miserable deaths, lots of unanswered cries, or that there are lots of evil people is just crushing. How can I live happily knowing all of that pain and agony is out there? I know its impossible to help everyone, fix everyone and their problems, nor is it my responsibility, but that just feels so selfish and cruel. Sometimes, I try to see the good in some people, and convince myself that theyre better than they seem, that they have good intentions, but more often that not, I end up empty handed and feeling shattered. Other times, I always doubt other people's intentions after their kind words or actions. I'm afraid they have some sort of ulterior motive. Am I too full of myself for thinking about others like that?Speaking of myself, I'm so untalented and unintelligent and that it's laughable. I lack creativity, I cant draw, write anything thats been done a million times before, neither am I athletic. I've tried playing basketball for some time, it didn't take me long to quit. I always get tired too quickly, I'm too stiff and I didn't feel the reward. I also learnt too slowly, and everyone around me was better than I am. I suck at almost every game I play and if do improve, its nothing crazy and theres not much improvement afterwards. If anything, my peak is just considered an average/casual player's skill level. I feel like I want to do everything, to be everything: a writer, a composer, a developer, an athlete, the list goes on. I have too many goals, but theyre all goals I'm passionate about and I don't know which ones do I really dedicate to. The funny thing is, I suck at them all. I even daydream and talk to myself or imagine talking to others with no end goal when I'm stressed or bored, and I waste too much time doing it. It's embarrassing.When it comes to school, I'm not any good either. I can't focus, I'm very slow at learning, and all my classmates are just better than I am. It makes me feel devastated. To make things even worse, I have 4 major exams in a month, and I'm really not ready for them. I will admit I am to blame due to some procrastination, but at the same time I genuinely doubt I was ever smart enough to do well in them anyway, especially maths, contrary to what my parents always tell me. I know that if I try asking my parents that I'm going to have to do them later so I'm more prepared, they will make my life a living hell worse than it already is. My parents often insult and belittle me, and scream at me. Do I deserve it sometimes? Yes. But most of the time their blood is boiling because of me over really petty things. They  also constantly force me to do things their way. For example they just refuse to believe that studying using electronics is any good, although it has greatly helped me before, and they also force me to study their way (whatever that means) , which I end up benefitting almost nothing from. I tried asking telling them about my struggles, I'm not sure if that helped. I tried asking them to book me with a therapist or a psychiatrist, they agreed but then forgot about it the very next day. (Using a hotline sounds so awkward and embarrassing, just like seeing a therapist, and aren't much of them where I live, but I'm really afraid that using one of them would get me in trouble.) Not to mention how they always blame me for my siblings' mischief or refuse to treat them their age. No way can I bring myself to hate my parents, I can tell they really do care for me. It's just don't know how to explain how I feel about them.I'm such an clumsy and uninteresting person, I make lots of impulsive decisions (especially purchases) that I end up regretting mere minutes later. Sometimes I feel awkward and try to force myself to fit in with a lot of people. I do have some friends that I relate to and can be comfortable around (to some degree) but even then, sometimes I'm just never in the picture. I even get ignored sometimes when were talking to each other. Another thing I noticed is when I'm alone with one of them, its basically silence. But when even two of them are with each other, theyre doing all sorts of things. Am I thinking in a self centered way again?Also, looking back at my past, I have tons and tons of regret and things id like to forget. I'm always in fear that its going to haunt me very soon, even though I believe I've changed and learnt from these mistakes. I know I can be better than this, but at the same time I can't do it whenever I try, and I just end up quitting. Im that fucking pathetic and untalentedI've tried to multiple times before, but I keep chickening out when it comes to killing myself. I've been like this for many months and I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to just doing it. I dont know what to do anymore. I'm losing my mind and I want it all to just stop.";Hi everyone.

I couldn't stay in that house, or look at her room. The air in the house was suffocating and I felt like the walls were closing in on me. I wouldn't wish that on my worse enemy. Especially not my family who will have to see my room or my cousin who I share with. But I think I'm going to end up feeling so suffocated all it will take is one bad day. Im in therapy, but it's not helping. My therapist wants to focus on my trauma. But she refuses to listen when I say it's not my trauma. There is something else. I live in the UK so it's only a 6 sessuon thing, I'm moving on to session 4. But I feel like I'm going crazy. My aunt says those who feel think they're going crazy, aren't. I don't know how much stock I'd put onto that. I know hearing voices are normally an indication.They're fine the majority of the time. Sometimes they're down right crule. But when I can't hear them I feel so alone. So I don't tell people about them. You tell someone your hearing voices in your head that don't belong to you and they get pretty freaked.So yeah, I think I'm going to kil myself. Not today, probably not tomorrow but soon, I think. I feel like if screaming asking someone to notice that something is wrong. That I shouldn't be feeling so incredibly low. Its so easy to feel like that and so hard to claw my way back. I normally claw so long that i go the compleate opposite.  Each time i fall harder and it takes me lo ger to rise out of it. And the highs, where I embarrass myself and feel hyper constantly, well theyre getting harder to not do something insane like spend my entire paycheck, but they're not lasting as long, wich makes to lows feel worse and worse. But despite the fact i feel like I'm screaming untill my throat is raw, no sound is coming out.So hi, i guess. This is me screaming for help. From a bunch of strangers in the internet, because i might not kill myself today. But if I don't start to feel better, then I will.

1c5rqed;Realized something recently;throwawayNazareth;I basically haven't left my bed in a decade. Not literally, but since high school I always just ended up in bed. In college, I would socialize and try, but I always made excuses to leave just to go back to bed. I'd skip so much class and just lie there. Not even the several types of ADs got me out. On my own, I was working and seemingly doing fine, but the second I got home I went right into bed, on my phone or just nothing. I hated wfh because I spend the whole day in bed, only getting up when necessary. Even now, I can barely get up to feed my damn self because I don't want to leave. I just want to sleep. At least when I'm asleep I don't hear him. At least when I'm asleep I'm not conscious. At least when I'm asleep I can imagine what being dead would finally be like. It's peaceful in a life of nothingness. Even if I did die, I've been dead for years. This is existence, not living. And I know it's my fault. I didnt and still don't care what happens to me, but it's only now that I realized it affects the people I care about too. Even if they don't say it, they want me here. But I don't. I want to hurt myself as much as possible. Anything in the chance that death will take this time. Quantum suicide may be real, or I was saved by someone or something the several times I've tried. If I died like him, maybe that would release my spirit back to be used for someone more deserving of it.I'm sorry to everyone I hurt. It's not fair to you, and you don't deserve that. Not a second goes by that I don't regret not just snuffing out my life sooner. I was blinded, and I can't undo the hurt I have caused to you. I wish I could. I'd do anything to alleviate your pain, even if it cost me anything. I think the only reason I haven't tried recently is that it was not opportune for everyone else. Everyone was facing problems, and I would only stack that pain, and in my worst scenario they would follow me back to God. I'm sorry. I don't want forgiveness, or amnesty, or to be accepted. All I want is for you to know you did nothing wrong. Don't blame yourselves, never do that. I truly do love you all.;I basically haven't left my bed in a decade.

1c5rlae;Worthless, Alone, Mistreated;Tacticool932;"If you told me one year ago I would be typing this I would’ve said you were nuts. I’m a 22 year old male from the US and these last 6 months have been the lowest in my short time here. I’m a single dad to a handsome 1 year old boy.  I work long hours  in public safety to provide the best life I can for my son. About 5 months ago I separated from my high school sweetheart and love of my life who I had every intention of marrying and doing life with. In the last 1.5 years of our relationship it was far from perfect, she cheated on me multiple times, showed me less attention, and constantly lied. She cheated on me with a variety of different co workers, stayed out at the bar while I was home with our son. I finally had enough after I caught her at a guys house right around the holidays, i told her I was done. Her family was well aware of all of her escapades and supported my decision, it’s been very difficult for me trying to get over this. She really isn’t much help with our son at all; I’ve got him primarily. I can’t seem to get over the idea of her, driving down a road I see memories appear in my head like a slideshow. I recently found out she is pursuing a relationship with the 4th guy I caught her cheating with, and has brought my son around him. It is destroying me on the inside. I not only lost the love of my life but I lost an entire family who I love. I often have thoughts of ending my life to stop the pain. I don’t want to die, but I’m tired of feeling the way that I feel, it is pure torture. I was very close a few weeks back, but someone called me and it stopped me. I often lay in my bed at night contemplating life, following it with the uncontrollable cries of missing feeling happy. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m losing myself. I had plans to propose to her in Tennessee last December, now she acts like I don’t exist anymore. Any man who says he is perfect to his partner isn’t telling the truth, I wasn’t perfect but I surely treated her like my queen. It just seems now that not waking up would be something I want. She isn’t the only reason I feel this way, it’s a large chunk of it though. But she was one of only things keeping me going in the first place, I want to stay strong for my boy, but I feel myself slipping.";If you told me one year ago I would be typing this I would’ve said you were nuts.

1c5rfbi;I love her so much it's killing me ;ReddLpng23;"Zero was my everything, and I ruined it all. I chose someone else—let's call her Zoe—over Zero. She is the sweetest person I've ever met; no matter how much she hurts me, I'll always see her as my angel. Choosing someone over Zero was the biggest regret of my life. I just wish we could have reconciled and healed together. I would have tried my hardest to be the best version of myself for her. I wanted to experience new things together. We both loved and hurt each other. All I wanted was for us to heal together and support each other like we used to because I know we could if we tried. I would always be there for her; no one knows her like I do, no one loves her like I do. She will never know how deeply sorry I am for what I did. Zero made me the happiest person on the planet, and I can't believe I ever left her. I often think of those nights in July, calling till the next morning then waking up on call just to keep talking and laughing with eachother. I just wish we could try and have those conversations again and I could show her the mistakes would never happen again. I still remember all her favorite things and interests. She made me feel special; being loved by her once makes me so happy, but knowing she despises me now is devastating. Despite everything, I still love her; I just wish she felt the same about me. I should have made things right with her when I had the chance; now, all I do is miss her. Guys, I don't know how much longer I can keep going through this; I think I'm just going to end my chapter a little early. I've done everything I ever wanted: fell in love, drove a car, had sex, learned to kickflip and backflip. I've accomplished all I ever wanted, and now that I can't have the love of my life, I think I'm okay with it being over. I hope she remembers me and the unconditional love I had for her, even if just for a little while. I always remembered her—the way her food couldn't touch, the way she showed me never to kill bugs because no matter how small a life is, all life is still precious, how passionate she was about her interests, especially music, and how good her music taste is. I could always tell her genuine smile from her fake one, yet both were so beautiful. I remember the way her eyes would light up. I know how she smokes in this silly way; you'd just have to be there to see it. I hope that if there is an afterlife, I'll remember all these things, and maybe I'll get to be her angel this time. If you guys don't hear from me again know I'll always be so thankful for you guys, and I truly hope you guys find the peace I couldnt. please be stronger than me, and never give up.";Zero was my everything, and I ruined it all.

There’s just an overwhelming amount of pain— mental, physical, emotional— that overwhelms my 23 year old body to the point where I stormed off from my partner and I’m sitting in a bathroom at the park with my pocket knife and begging god to give me a reason to not plunge it into my neck.

1c5q4bi;Stuck between do it and stay.(TW);FeistyServe1861;"So this will be a actually long story/venting. IF you are to be triggered please DONT read. (Its including ed's)So my mental health is very mess right now and my life. It all started with small insecurites of me being chubby and all. It all developed from being bullied from grade 3-6. My class wasn't the best since they bullied me and my 2 friends, first we were loners and it developes from there to being ganged up by the whole class... Of course the teachers knew about their behavior but no teacher did anything about it since they were a whole class bullying us.And im asian, so many pulled their eyes at me in school, called me ching chong and other things. And all these things made my insecurities grow. And I started to do a diet to go down in weight, I did one meal a day + snack. (Still do) since I find it the easiest diet for me. And what happend that turned my life was that my best friend got a ed. This is where it was small and it wasn't that bad, of course I had to deal with my insecurities but my friend was as important for me as my life. So I wanted to be her ""Therapist friend"" since she didn't have anyone to talk to that knew. And we started venting to eachother. Also in 6th grade I started developing ""Sleep procrastination."" (Sorry for the bad spelling.)Wich gave me plenty sleepless nights and huge headaches, and when you counted the bullying I avoided going to school since I was tired and scared even though my friends were with me. And this all continued until my insecurities grew so big I couldn't even look at myself anymore without nearly throwing up, I unfortunally developed social anxiety/anxiety by these things also. My grades dropped and I grew to hate myself so much I couldn't stand myself anymore. And I felt helpess to my friend, I couldn't help her any way. I could just watch her struggle and when she would ask me to help her throw away food, I helped her. I couldn't stand myself anymore after helping her even until today. She eventually got put in the hospital since her stomach closed up. And it all combined made me deppressed.It was all a mess and I wish I didn't help my friend, the only way I can describe it is that I wanted to help ""her mentally"" but I couldn't also help her ""physically"" at the same time...And I feel like a f@cking piece of shit. It all sounds so ""lightly"" like I know I don't deserve to think that I can be depressed and want to kms, but I just can't stand this all. I still have some things in life I still enjoy besides family and friends. And it crushes me and drives me insane to know that I'm 50/50 on doing it. And recently in school we had a health checkup that we needed to answer a few questions on a paper, and this all used to be private but without thinking I answerd honestly, and the school nurse will be talking to us personally about our answerd questions. And now im totally scared she will bust me and call my parents.And of course the school days destroy me with stress since im in highschool now. Sorry for venting here. But I have no one to turn to now.-And please take care.";So this will be a actually long story/venting. IF you are to be triggered please DONT read.

1c5p4p1;I've been in physical pain for the past 8 years, I'm so done with this shit;TheJollyJagamo;I'm a 27m, living in the us. Throughout my teenage years, I was extremely active physically, be it swimming, longboarding, mountain biking, etc... anything that would give an adrenaline rush. Being active was one of the few things that truly gave me happiness. About 8 years ago I started to do a bunch of dumb shit and didn't listen to my body. To spare you the long details, I'm now in a place to where I have immense pain in my right big toe, my right knee, both my hands/forearms, and I'm obese. Doing better on the obese part, lost 80lbs in the past year. Doing simple things like walking or using a computer can cause a lot of pain and discomfort. Anyways, I've been in near constant physical and emotional pain for the past like 8 years. Because of these health problems, I haven't been able to do anything I want to with my life. I can't do the things that brought me joy, I can't have a job that I would enjoy, and worst of all, there is almost nothing I can do about it without going into severe medical debt. I've tried to fix my issues without going to the doctors, but it has only gotten me so far. I'm working 2 shitty jobs, 60 hours a week rn to just scrape by, neither job offers health insurance because I'm not full time. They're the few jobs I can do with all my physical limitations, and I'm not sure if there is a job I could physically do that would offer health insurance that I wouldn't kill myself having after a while. I used to be a developer, but got fired over a year ago due to new management, and since then I wasn't able to get anything else. But now my hands are so bad that I can't really type for that long anymore. It's my career goal to be a developer once again, but I just don't know if that will be possible. I'm just so done with life at this point. My entire 20's have been fucking terrible, just one shitty thing after another. Just when I think I can finally do something with my life, my body says NOPE and it's just more pain and more bullshit.

About 10 months later we moved from Ohio to Tennessee I stayed their for two years then came back to live with my grandparents and my dad like we did before. all throughout this time I changed schools after every grade so I never made any friends really. skip to when im 11 we move in with his new girlfriend and kids to which I'm still living here 5 years later. I started school at this new school let's call it knight when I was in the eighth grade I would see this person in the hallway and I remember thinking they were the most beautiful person to ever exist lets call them zero. skip to a few months later she starts to talk to me and we go on a date where she kissed me for the first time. after that we began dating amd it lasted for a year and a half. we were best friends, we would always see eachother every other day, call every night; she was the person ive been the closest to. we lost our virginity to eachother a couple months into our relationship and I feel like that brought us closer. we had a few arguments only because she loved me so much and never wanted me to like anyone else which I didn't. skip to october I start becoming friends again with a friend I use to have let's call her zoe. zoe had kissed me once 5 months before this and I never told zero so when zero found out they were hurt and I felt so bad I didn't tell them. eventually zero breaks up with me and the next day I hungout w zoe and we made out then the next day zero came over wanting to get back with me even after seeing the hickeys. I can't believe I ever did that to her. she wanted me back for weeks but I was scared to get back in it. she started liking a friend of mine and I tried so hard to get back with her and make things work because even though i didn't stuff with zoe after we broke up I always wanted to be with zero. zero never got back with me and she started dating my friend and told me she had sex with him I know I shouldn't care but I do it breaks my heart. I tried to fix things with zero so many times because we were the closest people and I still love her so much. her and ny friend eventually broke up after 5 months and we started texting again we even planned on hanging out in the same little town we had our first date om. then she ditched me to go with her friends. I know ive hurt her but I've tried every second to make up for my mistakes and be there for her, but she's never even apologized or cares that she hurt me by telling people close things I only shared with her or her telling people about sexual things we would do that people now randomly go up and ask me which makes me so uncomfortable. we're back to not talking again, one night I took a bunch of pills and told her I loved her goodbye, sadly it didn't work so the next morning she tells me that me telling her I loved her made her uncomfortable and she doesnt wanna talk to me anymore.I care about her more than anyone could imagine she's my angel. it breaks me everyday that I didn't get back with her and fix things like we should've. I just, I don't think I can go on without her; I don't want to go on without her. I can't keep coming into my room and remembering her there, I can't keep dreaming and seeing her there then being so sad when she's gone and I wake up.

She understood me so well and loved me and I just didn’t try hard enough I know she’s starting to see someone else now and it just kills me knowing how replaceable I am compared to her I lost a lot of my friends and I don’t even know where to got find new ones, I had only a few out of college but I work a lot and can’t seem to make any new connections I just feel like I fucked it all up, I can’t get my head out of the past and it kills me knowing what could’ve beenIt feels like the best thing at the moment, the pain is unbearable and it feels like it’s only getting worse.

1c5ojqj;I'll kill myself before sunday;_Citrus_Friend;I don't want anyone telling me how things get better because I lost the hope that they do a ling time ago. I'm only ever living for ither people and I've attempted several times in the past but now I have a plan that might actually work. I don't care about staying for anyone else anymore, they will all genuinely be better without me anyway. Or at the very least they'll be sad for a while but then they'll just forget. I hope they forget about me. I've tried getting help from family, friends and professionals but it never actually helps. Every day I am in physical pain because I'm hurting so much mentally. I'm going to kill myself, I've wrote the letters and in the process of writing any preferences for my funeral. Wheather or not I get scared at the last moment, I don't know. I intend on doing it when no one else is in the house so that I can't go to anyone to ask to be taken to hospital, I intend on it actually killing me this time. I've tried a lot to make life worth living but it really isn't worth it. I''m done now, I've made the decision about what I'm going to do and its going to kill me.

1c5o7ey;Suffering ;Bright_Possibility_6;I got permanent dents on my forehead from a bike accident back in August of 2015 and a scar on the top of my head from brain surgery. But the worst part was that I was the worst public drunk ever. I was stumbling everywhere I went downtown, got kicked out of a hockey game cause I passed out, had to be hauled to detox several times, pants around my ankles several times. I’ll never get over what I bad drunk I was. I guarantee that’s the reason I have very few friends. I’m sure all people will remember about me is how much of a bad drunk I use to be and that guy who needed brain surgery shortly after he sobered up. I can’t take this life anymore. I’m in tears every single day. It was my fault that I didn’t stop drinking earlier and it was my fault that I wasn’t wearing a bike helmet that day. I can’t even look in the mirror without seeing those dents on my forehead. I would do anything to kill myself…I’m sooo sorry 😢;I got permanent dents on my forehead from a bike accident back in August of 2015 and a scar on the t;;3;5;2024-04-16 18:59:09;2024-04-16;Tuesday;18:59:09;927;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:33.613735

But now everything is overwhelming for me I can't think and I feel so weak and can't do anything. I hear voices or idk what that is but it keeps telling me that I should die or sometimes even hurt someone but still I always try the best to hide everything from others. Due to this I can't sleep so I wear headphones all the time still it doesn't work..

1c5ntwl;Poverty & disability are going to make me do it;slurpeestar;My husband and I were forced to move out from his parent's house a little over a month ago. I understand they wanted their space, but with the current financial & housing market it's a struggle to find anything affordable. We found one, but honestly it's just barely out of our budget, we didn't have much of a choice though, we couldn't move too far, and we'd rather not be homeless. We're now living paycheck to paycheck and we don't even turn on the lights in the house or use the AC units often. I don't know what we're going to do once summer rolls around, it gets bad here.The place isn't great. Middle of nowhere, no central AC or heat, there were gas heaters, but they had to be taken out because of multiple gas leaks, we now only have space heaters. None of the windows open, they've been painted shut, and both our neighbors are hoarders, we're surrounded by filth. There's no fence, and wild dogs come and go through it. I even had a pitbull charge at me, had to get my mace. There's no space to cook in the kitchen, and no matter how much we clean there's a constant layer of dust on everything. I hate it.I'm disabled too, got sick 3 years ago and never got better, now I'm in a wheelchair and doctors never figured it out. I had to stop going to them because I lost my insurance. I haven't been to a dentist in ages too, I have chronic tooth pain as well as pain in the rest of my body 24/7. I got Covid back in January and it damaged my lungs, hospital bills have been a nightmare. I had to go back again last month because I'm STILL having complications from it, I tried to push it back as long as I could, but I got emaciated and started blacking out everywhere. I can't work, and I feel like such a burden to my husband, who's been nothing but good to me.I'm terrified and don't leave our room anymore. Everything costs money from using the washing machine to taking showers. Cooking to turning on a light to look for something in the dark. I stopped talking to friends and family, I just sit here alone all day everyday now.I've struggled with my mental health since I was a child, I'm now in my 20s and I genuinely feel like I shouldn't have made it past 18. It's all been downhill since then. Nothing feels worth it, and by next year we probably won't have a place to live and there's nothing I can do about it.I've tried Medicare and all the free insurance options in our area, I don't qualify because I don't have a diagnosis. I've tried filing for disability, same issue. We don't qualify for food stamps or low income housing either. We don't pay for anything extra, we don't eat out. We stopped going on dates and other than work, my husband doesn't leave the house.My husband's job is most likely going to go under too, they're underperforming and starting to let people go even though he was just hired a few months ago as a supervisor.I was doing okay for a while, my mental health was getting better and things were looking up. Then we moved, and now I want to die again. It's not looking up from here, I keep trying to tell myself that it'll get better, but every waking second here is a nightmare. I only want to drink and sleep, but I know I can't do that, it's too expensive anyways.I don't know how to tell myself to keep going, poverty and disability are going to be the death of me, I can just feel it. I've already plotted out how I wanted to go, I've tried pills in the past but they didn't work, I'm too scared to cut... But there's a train just on the other side of the road, it blares it's horn so loud every hour when it passes. I think about it every time it goes. Only reason I haven't tried yet is because I'm afraid if I somehow survive I'll be an even bigger burden on my family.My husband knows where I'm at mentally, but he's not good with this kind of stuff and doesn't know what to do. I'm posting here as a last resort, I can't say I didn't try.;My husband and I were forced to move out from his parent's house a little over a month ago.

1c5n12z;Hopeless.;BigContribution2259;This might be a long post, and this is indeed a throwaway account. I've been feeling hopeless lately, my life has been painful for me, there's definitely people out there who's experienced more hardships, and it adds on guilt. When I was a kid I would always get hit by my parents, whenever I cried, they'd hit me till I stop, whenever they didn't like how things were going or how I acted, they'd hit me. The hittings would go from the belt, a stick, straight up punches, I've been chocked, at one point dad got on top of me and put my arms in a lock so I couldn't block his punches and felt so defenseless, he did that because I pushed him when I had enough. They made me feel so little and that feelings don't matter. It kept going till I was 19 (I'm 22, about to be 23 in a couple days). Outside of my house life it was equally worst, I was bullied and I felt so different from everyone, I also got in fights. Growing up I felt like I don't deserve to be liked/loved, my first relationship I was lied to, and I'll admit, I've messed up in relationships, I kept trying to be better. I chased someone who kept flirting back with me only to feel like a third wheel. I tried committing at age 19 by hanging, it failed since the necktie broke. Now I've been in this one relationship for 11 months now, first time I've been ever happy, now it's all crashing down, and I'll admit it was because of my doing. I made her unhappy, I lied to her, I overstepped her boundaries, I made her feel disrespected, I put people before her, I emotionally neglected her. To give more info I was recently diagnosed with BPD (Borderline personality disorder), I don't want to use it as an excuse because, that was my own choices, I take accountability for it. After a while I attempted again a few months ago, through pills, this time I got rushed to the ER and got help. I accepted their program because I want to be better for me and my partner. I thought things would become better, but karma definitely hits when you've hurt someone so much. She's unhappy, and now I feel like that one person who finally made me happy, will leave me soon, I destroyed my own happiness and her happiness, the happiness I've been looking for ever since I was a kid.Now I feel incredibly hopeless, no future in sight, unhappy with myself, and I really just want to end it. My plan is on my birthday, which I don't really celebrate, I'll end it, I'll end all this pain and maybe, I won't be unhappy anymore. It all just hurts and I want to finally rest, I know it'll affect people around me the friends I made and supported me, my family, my little sister, but I'm tired, I want to rest, I'm hopeless and everything just hurts. I don't know what to do anymore.;This might be a long post, and this is indeed a throwaway account.

(Everyone: ""Hi Veteran!"")The reason I made this decision today was my health has been detoriorating quickly quite recently. I'm sure my health's been affected by the decades of often quite heavy drinking as well.My polyneuropathy is taking all over my body (feet, legs, torso, face), and it's getting numb faster than ever, and the neuro pain is quickly getting worse.  My hands also shake like a leaf in the wind even sober, let's say I wouldn't start the piano now, and tbh, my brain isn't doing all that hot either, there's a lot of rethinking and retyping involved in this message.The level of my withdrawals, I'm not even gonna go there.So I decided that today's the day, as it only seems to be getting worse, more rapidly than ever. So ""This far! No further!"" it's gonna be, my captain.I'm slowly sipping the last case I bought, gathering courage, but also to look back at my life, what was it like, and was it all worth it.

It was truly the worst experience of my life. That’s the only thing stopping me, that if I failed I’d be sent there again, but I can feel myself starting not to care about it anymore because I could lie my way out of it and get out to try again.

1c5m19o;How to stop sleeping as a coping mechanism?;Salt-Tomorrow8686;I do this literally every time something bad happens or I'm in pain. Stomachaches? Sleep. Random headache that's probably a migraine? Sleep. Breathing? Sleep. Wanting to kill myself? Sleep. I mean this isnt really a bad way to deal with it but it's not working recently. Everytime I'm feeling like I can slit my own wrist I would just go to sleep and wake up feeling better. Or at least get a 1 hour invincibility frame.Now when I wake up, all those thoughts just immediately resurface back in a second. So not only am I still wanting to die, I can now think about more clearly because of how more awake I am. Great. I'm not even coping right now I'm just copium (sorry for that lmao).Also, because of this I'm just generally more sleepy than usual, no matter how much I sleep. I'm more tired through the day and can't get anything done. I feel like a lazy shit.So I would like to know how to stop this and/or get a different way of avoiding my emotions.

I can't get a job, I can't pay for my university fees, I'm 33 with no prospects of a better future. The community I live in doesn't actually care if trans women live or die and mostly tries to make life so hard that it makes more sense to commit suicide. I don't really see the point anymore. I've tried getting mental healthcare but they keep insisting that there is nothing wrong with me and that I'll be fine. There is only so much I can do. This page has given me so much hope because I don't see suicide as a terrible option anymore. Why keep fighting when you could just disappear? Especially if everyone around you wants the same? I want to die and I realize the beauty in accepting that now. I've never been more at peace now that I am planning my exit.

1c5ldrf;My wife doesn't know if she loves me and I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts;Training-Bed-9546;"To be clear, it's not her fault.  It's mine.  I've been a horrible husband.  Just not very helpful.  She takes on so much for our family.  She does so much for our kids. She's lost weight because of the stress and the labor. I've been trying hard to make things up to her.  Helping out more.  Making sure the house is clean.  Making sure she has as little to do as possible before she gets home, but this surge of thoughtfulness is only about two weeks old.  I doubt she trusts it will last.  I've been unhelpful off and on for almost five years now.  I don't know why I'm just waking up to all of this now.But it makes me think that maybe it's all too little, too late. She won't touch me in any affectionate way.  She doesn't feel any sexual feelings toward me.  And who could blame her?  I'm 39 and although I'm not completely out of shape, I am declining.  I'm turning forty.  I'm becoming just generally unattractive and it's only going to get worse as I get older.  And I can't stop thinking about how much it sucks to get older.  The slow decline that apparently started in my 30s is only getting worse at 39.  I feel like a useless middle aged man that's only going to end up dragging everyone down.  It feels inevitable that eventually my wife is going to get her groove back and it's not going to be with me.  And though it upsets me, I can't blame her.  What have I done to deserve her love and affection?So I can't help but think that things would be better if I were out of the way.  I don't want to leave and watch my kids being raised by someone way better than me in everyway.  I can't stand by and watch my wife fall in love with someone else while I decline and age, becoming more and more pathetic.If we were to divorce I'd have nothing.  I have no adult friends.  My brother and I used to talk but he's pissed off at me and refuses to speak to me.  I have no one and nothing else.  I just keep thinking, things would be better for her without me there.I told her I was having these thoughts about killing myself during a text rant.  I was upset that she won't touch me in anyway.  I accused her of not loving me.  That's when she told me that she doesn't know if she loves me.  She's never addressed that I mentioned my struggles with thoughts about killing myself.  It makes me wonder if she, deep down, hopes that I'll do it.  Release her from her fuck up of a husband.I've had these thoughts off and on for awhile but this is day 3 of me trying to stop vaping and these thoughts have been pretty persistent today.  I'm at work but I went into an empty meeting room so I could just be upset for a few minutes.  I guess I just realized that I love my wife, and I'm in love with her and she doesn't feel the same way at all.  And that is all my fault.  I just have no idea if trying to take on more responsibility and help around the house more is going to convince her that I'm trying to change. Or if she even cares.  I keep thinking ""do I deserve to be loved by her?"" And if I don't, then do I deserve to live knowing my existence is a complete drag on her.";To be clear, it's not her fault.  It's mine.  I've been a horrible husband.  Just not very helpful. ;;0;1;2024-04-16 17:06:24;2024-04-16;Tuesday;17:06:24;3080;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:33.652164
1c5ldr0;I could have prevented someone’s death. (?);TheIcarusGirl;"TL;DR: In a small town, a misunderstanding over a dog with a neighbor led to guilt and sorrow, particularly when the neighbor took her own life. Reflecting on the situation, I question if things could have turned out differently.(Home a).  In a small town in my area, there's a girl, who is my neighbor and is much younger than me but older than my sister. It's not really in my nature to talk to strangers, although in this small place it's the norm, but the cordiality and friendliness of saying good morning to those you don't know isn't always within my reach as I'm more introverted and reserved in my interactions. However, I do smile at people as I pass by them. This particular girl smiles back at me. I don't see her often since going out isn't something I do frequently, but she seems nice. Seeing her that day left me thinking about how young she is and the decisions she has ahead of her, decisions I wish I could change in my own life (the career I chose and the place I was going to live).A couple of months pass, and the lack of space at home becomes more and more. This isn't good because we have pets. First (1), there's my dog, who has been with us since 2016. Its already been three years and she’s became an indoor dog. She got used to it because the place we lived in didn't have a yard, and because I loved her with all my heart (I wanted her to sleep on my bed). For a long time, I had begged to have a puppy, and finally, they got her for me. She arrived at the house one day out of the blue and she's still with us after 8 years. She's saved me from many dark moments with my own depression, she's been my companion all this time, through all those midnight moments that only those who have contemplated unsubscribing from life know. I keep telling to myself I can't die, I can't leave her alone. She'll never have an explanation on why I left, and she won't understand why her owner disappeared.(2) Then there's my younger sister's dog. We got her later. She was small in age but not in size, maybe two years old when all this happened if my mind doesn't fail me. We got her through adoption. In our old house (we move a lot). In this place (home a) there was a black dog that we loved. We knew her life was on the streets, so we fed her when we saw her. We named her ""Sharpie,"" like the marker. She got pregnant, and our neighbors at the time, who owned the father, kept the puppies. Eventually, those same neighbors moved away and left their pets behind in that neighborhood. All 4 dogs (mom and puppies) became street dogs overnight, so we kept one. We named her Bambi. That dog loved my sister. We learned to love her with her antics and her playful and tireless personality. She always had energy, and most of all, she was always hungry. Eventually, she grew a lot, and our yard (home b) felt too small for her. My mother thought she'd be better off with other people, and we were trying to save money, and feeding her was starting to feel “burdensome”. So my mother convinced my sister that it was better to give her away, and my sister, without fully understanding, said yes, not knowing the pain she still feels today for having given her away. But it was something done in the name of giving the dog a better quality life. And who did she give Bambi to? To our neighbor with the smiles. (Who is also a very distant relative of ours).A month after this happened, my sister's pain hurt me, and I talked to my mother about what she had done and that it was her responsibility to get the dog back since she had gotten us into this situation. She reluctantly spoke with the family of this girl, and it was agreed that the girl could visit us whenever she wanted to see Bambi. This plan went on for the next two weeks. The girl visited less and stopped smiling at me. I felt sorry for her, knowing she was resentful for getting so excited about having a new pet. I felt terrible for putting her in that situation, but I never told her, we never talked about anything really, and even less now that she hated me for the pain we had caused her. (I use the word hate because that's how it feels when you're a teenager, intense). I actually don't know if she wished me bad or not.With my own depression, I wasn't doing well. In fact, I attempted to unsubscribe from life around those same months, but I can't remember if it was before or after Bambi... what I'm saying is that I didn't pay much attention to the girl's reaction back then, I thought she would get over it, eventually it would just be a bitter memory.My family moved again. This place we were in was too small to continue my sister's studies (I had already dropped out of university for not being able to meet my academic grades).. this time when we moved, we decided to leave Bambi with family closer to us (in blood proximity, not in distance between houses), with whom we had a closer relationship, and my sister would be happy to know that our dog was well taken care of. Months after leaving Bambi with our family, we were informed of an offer someone made for her. After all, she was a very beautiful dog, white with brown spots. My mom accepted the offer mainly to remove the burden of caring for an extra pet from our family, for which we weren't providing maintenance. So Bambi went with people I have never seen, nor has my sister, and she is in a place we don't know. We haven't heard from her for years, and my sister is devastated nonetheless. And… the girl with the smiles? She committed suicide two years ago.She died roughly 2 years after we asked her to return Bambi to us, and all this time I've wondered... if it was all in vain. Perhaps she could have kept Bambi, maybe she would have had someone to accompany her just like I have. Perhaps she wouldn't have died if I hadn't spoken to my mother about the dog. I know she left a note when she died, but I don't know what it said as that remained between her close family. And if she happened to mention Bambi in it, I don't think they would tell me anyway, so I wouldn't believe them if they said it wasn't my fault. I feel her death on my conscience.";"TL;DR: In a small town, a misunderstanding over a dog with a neighbor led to guilt and sorrow, parti";;2;2;2024-04-16 17:06:23;2024-04-16;Tuesday;17:06:23;6110;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:33.653830

1c5knac;The only way out;Sirgrief404;Hello,29M,italian. I'm struggling with crippling depression since many years,I feel like there's no more hope for me and I get the hints from this as the days go on. In the past,I managed to recover my strenght but in the last four years I'm just digging my grave deeper and deeper. I have nobody to talk to,I have no more friends close to me,left my job and almost broke. I try to hide my pain,try to act normal but this behavior just drains my few energy out. I can't leave my house without feeling anxious or disperate,even though I may look ok. I rejected an eccellent job because I didn't feel worthy and capable enough,so that's making me experiencing a terrible regret. Everyday, especially in the morning and in the afternoon,I'm besieged by vivid thoughts of death and suicide as if it could be the only way things can go. I'm looking for a painless death, because I suffered for too long. Once I was stronger,persistent,happier. But now I'm just an automaton,I feel like I belong to the dead. And I'm neither free to leave this earth because if I do so it will be a shame to my parents and my surroundings. Many years ago I had a car crash in the deep of the night and I always think I've should be gone. Killing myself will only mean that I've acknowledged the failure I am. If things won't become better,I'll end this misery. It's just a matter of time,I don't think I'll make to my 30. I'm sick of this world,of this people,of these pointless wars,of these politicians and whatever evil mankind can produce. Sorry for this rant.;Hello,29M,italian.

I'll die one of these days and we'll go our separate ways. Maybe we'll get to see each other again? That'd be great. I'm not betting on that happening tho.

1c5kffy;Tomorrow’s the day.;Broken-girl6;So I’ve suffered from mh since I was a baby being ripped out of my mother’s arms because I was abused and neglected by the guy in the home. I was in foster care then I had biological family adopt me due to court orders. They didn’t want me in the beginning, my mental health got really bad when I was 8 I developed an ed then started to sh at the age of 10. My family found out I sh at the age of 14. They told my mother and her and I got in an argument and she killed herself. Things got really bad when she did that and the bullying got much worst. I was getting r@ped and sa a lot. I got sa’d at school and the same guy told me the morning of my mother’s death to go kill myself. The school did nothing so I brought him to court but the vice principal provided the court with false evidence and the judge said she believed me because I have my facts straight and he didn’t but due to the false evidence he was pled not guilty. My family reversed my adoption and I was placed back into foster care at the age of 15 and I was sent over 3 hours away from home for a long time. A lot happened since but I’m not getting into that. My dad just died from cancer last month and he was more a dad to me than my biological dad was and I’ve never met my real dad.  Going through my dads death is really traumatic as I’m still not over my mothers death and I’m reliving all the same things again. I’ve had a few attempts in the past couple of months and my sh is getting really bad the doctors say they’ve never seen anything like it before. I’ve had this plan for a while now but this time it’s going to work it is bullet proof. In the eye of the government they are talking about allowing me to kill myself and they won’t do anything about it for personal reasons and it’s about dam time!  Today is my partners bday so I couldn’t do it today so I planned for tomorrow and I already have had my letters ready and everything I need for my attempt. I’ve already said goodbye to the people I actually like. I have my will done and also who will get my dog. If tomorrow I get stopped or I fail at attempting I’m not gonna stop till I succeed. I’m done with this cruel world. People are so nasty and rude no one can afford anything anymore, my family disowned me and I don’t have a good enough reason to stay. My partner is aware of my plan just not the date of it. I know this won’t happened but maybe the mh system will learn a bit from not helping as well as always hanging up the phone when I call the crisis line because they don’t want to talk or they have another call they have to take. I have to make sure everything in my room is perfect so that no one else has to deal with it. This is going to work and I’m going to make sure of it.;So I’ve suffered from mh since I was a baby being ripped out of my mother’s arms because I was abuse;;1;3;2024-04-16 16:28:20;2024-04-16;Tuesday;16:28:20;2731;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:33.671138

I haven't planned to hurt myself or wanted to hurt myself. But I just wanna disappear, I just want it to be over.For years I've struggled socially and academically because of my autism. I'm in university and struggling because I can't admit my problems. I find friends online but still feel lonely a lot. I'm also probably aromantic because of my autism and think that my way of dealing with not being able to feel romantically attracted to anyone I just become hypersexual. Which in the past few days has come out to friends online and elad to me being ousted from all their communities. I don't know why I can't control myself when I shouldn't be doing those kinds of things. Even after finally getting academic support, I've done things, which I thought were subtle, in video call meetings. I know it was wrong, and sick and disgusting but I don't know why I did it. Now I've lost that support, and am in a sexual misconduct investigation with my university. I'm scared, I'm so scared. This was my last chance to get through school and I fucked up again because I'm a sick person. I just want to crawl in a hole and die because I don't deserve all the good things I have. If this leads me to being removed from the university, and possibly police intervention I think it might drive me to actually try and hurt myself.;For over a year now I've been depressed.

1c5jbcp;How do I live with my suicidal thoughts?;poptart786;I haven’t ever posted to Reddit or ever reached out in this way for help but maybe someone that’s older or just a new perspective could help. I’m 18 years old and I have a wonderful girlfriend, I have a great family. I have all the love in the world. And yet I still don’t want to be here. I’ve struggled with depression for quite a while. I had an attempt when I was 15/16 and I was in a hospital for about 2 weeks after that. At first, I was really glad I did it. Because after I lived I got to feel how much love I had around me that I just didn’t see before. I never could understand that people would notice if I was gone. And for a good amount of time I didn’t have those thoughts or impulses. I was happy to be alive and I didn’t think I’d ever feel like that again. It’s harder to explain how I’m feeling then before. Before I didn’t know people loved me and  was not in a good enough place to realize that. Now though, I know people love me and I know that they would help me if I asked for it. But now I don’t know if I want that help. I don’t want to be here anymore plain and simple I guess. I don’t really know how else to put it. I hadn’t  ever self harmed before my attempt and I haven’t done anything like that after it but I keep getting impulses to try it. Just to maybe distract me for actually ending my life.  I have so much time left in my life but a part of me doesn’t want that. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to be alive. I’ve been medicated before and nothing seems to do the trick because the thoughts always come back. Sometimes I’m angry at myself for feeling this way because it feels so unfair to everyone else that I want to die. So I guess I’m asking how do people do it? I know there isn’t a cure or anything but how do I just get through everyday life like this and does it ever go away?;I haven’t ever posted to Reddit or ever reached out in this way for help but maybe someone that’s ol;;3;7;2024-04-16 15:43:31;2024-04-16;Tuesday;15:43:31;1836;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:34.774248

1c5i5i2;Trying to work myself to death as a means of avoiding the guilt of suicide;Complex-Writing8102;Hey folks - 41M here. I've done a lot of work on my mental health, but nothing seems to be working. Long story short - I have no overt trauma, but a lot of little things growing up coupled with being highly sensitive. I have CPTSD and always feel as though I'm never enough and the world is too much, too loud, too nasty, all the time. I just don't feel very much joy and wish I weren't here. I chronically feel as though I am a disappointment to others, particularly my parents, and there's no way for me to express to them that I know deep down how much I've let them down, no matter what I accomplish, for not being born as the child that they wanted.At any rate, I never signed up for this life and I'm just so sick of this ride. The guilt of the trauma that I'd inflict on others around me has prevented me from killing myself thus far. But lately, I've been longing for like a terminal cancer diagnosis so that I have a way out that people will accept without guilt. I've also toyed with the notion of finding someway to slowly poison myself to induce a terminal illness while making it look like an accident. Most recently, I've been hoping that I could work myself to death. I'm stressed much of the time and push myself very hard physically. This has led to me developing high blood pressure. I'm fairly fit, but I've been wondering if I could find a way to push myself hard enough physically through bursts of extremely intense exercise so that I could induce a heart attack or stroke. If I could find a way to do that in an isolated environment, I could die that way by natural causes. The idea is that this would appease my guilt at hurting people by overtly, say, jumping off a bridge, while also dealing with the feeling that I'll never be enough by pushing myself so hard that I literally die. I have to say, the idea is deeply satisfying to me.Curious if anyone else out there has had similar thoughts? Thanks for reading.;Hey folks - 41M here.

1c5hdgl;I think I'm finally ready to go;Miserable-Car-7360;For my whole life I felt different and isolated. Never really had a group of friends. I am 27 and I never had sex I didn't pay for. I lived in my last town for close to 10 years and never made a single friend. I spend my weekends crying and getting high. When I was younger I thought I would find my place in the world but I do not really believe that anymore. My mind is a clusterfuck of bitterness and envy. I have always been scared of death but lately it's starting to look like a very appealing option. No more crying myself to sleep. No more envy and loneliness. No more attempting to fit in. No more trying and trying and trying just to stay afloat. Just blissful nothing.In the past I thought that in order to take my own life I would need to hate myself hard enough, but lately I have felt a weird sense of compassion towards myself. This life wasn't meant for me and that's ok. Maybe not everything is my fault, maybe I wasn't given all the tools I needed to navigate life and relationships, and that's ok. We treat death like this big scary monster but if you see it from another perspective it's just peace. I did some research and decided I will order a helium tank and a CPAP mask. I will cook myself a nice dinner, maybe have a couple beers to take the edge off, and in a few deep breaths I will be free. I always pictured suicide as this gruesome violent act but maybe it doesn't have to be, maybe it can just be one final act of self love.I wanted to share my feelings here because in any other place people would think I'm completely nuts.;For my whole life I felt different and isolated.

1c5gyy9;Losing the fear of death;signalife;"It's cliché to say but depression has been a constant shadow in my (admittedly short) life. Very early I've been told I lost that ""brightness"" in my eyes, or my smile: around eleven or twelve (entering the first year of high school where I'm from) depression was a settled matter even though I hadn't necessarily seeked any professional diagnosis; you don't need a genius to tell you a kid doing self harm for attention and contemplating suicide isn't quite normal. The truth is I always stood aside, among both peers and family (quite literally been called the ""black sheep"" at family dinners). Sometimes said times aside from everyone were a choice because I'm a calm person who does enjoy alone time, a lot of other times I wasn't even given the choice and was just brushed off. I can understand if people around me ever felt put off by my attitudes, considering a depressed child with built up rage and recitant to touch is almost like trying to befriend a feral animal, but alas, these same people people proclaim familial unity through all ups and downs...My first attempt at suicide was around fourteen; I'd already been fantasizing about jumping off the highest ground in my school building (private school, grades weren't great, I was realizing some things and teenagers are just assholes) buy anyway, I tried overdosing on whatever the fuck I could find and it obviously didn't work and just made me sick for weeks—I have trouble swallowing pills now from that. Second and third were around fifteen to seventeen I believe, my parents were made aware about my first attempt by my therapist at the time and called me stupid and selfish for even thinking of that and to this day make fun of it and me, so I tried jumping onto traffic and later hanging myself, neither of which resulted in anything.Per the title you could have guessed why: all these attempts were kind of halfassed and more of attention ploys that anything else because I'd been really afraid of what would really happen afterward so even if I tried and I had these ideations and thoughts and plans, I always managed to find even the silliest thing to keep myself alive: a song that I played on looped because I want to listen to it ""one last time""; a new movie is coming out that I want to watch; my favorite music group is performing at the biggest stage of their country at the end of the year; I want to read, I want to study. And they worked, my fear of death was very strong and anything that could divert me from it served well enough and I'm almost twenty one now –when I didn't think I'd make it to eighteen– and have (or had) passions and ambitions. However, with age, each year I found myself changing, maybe neither for better or for worse but I changed, and so did my knowledge and my views: my conscience. My entire country (as per every other country in the world I'm sure) is a battle- a bloodfield nowadays, the world at large sure is; I can't help but feel so much and it has caused me personal troubles at home even. Anxiety this year has skyrocketed, there's not a second of time where I ever feel at peace, I don't leave my house much and even as I type I feel my heart racing. I am so lost and very, very alone despite people around me all the time. I've no idea where even the nearest future, like, tomorrow, is headed, much less my life in the long run, to the point I'm not sure there's a future at all. All my passions lie dead on the ground, there's little to nothing keeping me going, even the excuses don't work this time. Everything is so numb and meaningless despite my active effort to be positive and encourage others to be hopeful and think positively. I've been writing suicide letters, I'd never done that in previous attempts it makes it feel so much realer this time, a proper goodnye. You could argue this is one, too. I'm not so scared of death anymore, I contemplate it almost constantly, always thinking of how I could take my own life, placing a date, treating myself before the inevitable comes. I did think, since November or so, to get myself checked into a mental health hospital, but I don't think it'll do much of anything, am too self aware and it's so easy to just get away with being okay.I've never not thought about suicide. It has been engraved in my mind for a long time that I would die young and that it would be by suicide; I was naïve in thinking this could ever go otherwise. Maybe it'll be my own birthday present.";It's cliché to say but depression has been a constant shadow in my (admittedly short) life.

1c5goxo;Should I check into the mental hospital;Adventurous-Gap8596;A few warnings: suicide, eating disorders, and depression are mentionedSo I’m currently at my second semester at my university as a first year student. My grades have always been fine and even to what I would consider excellent up until two weeks ago. Since January, my mental health has declined significantly. I’ve been to the hospital for OD on alcohol in an attempt to kill myself and was placed in the psych ward for five days. I have a history of major chronic depression, and for some reason this last semester has been extremely difficult to navigate due to my mental health. I’ve lost almost 40 pounds since January and have restricted my eating for almost 8 months now. I’ve also had a history with bulimia and received a diagnosis for ednos when I was in middle school. Anyway, I’m sure you get the point that I’m really sick. I’ve been to the on campus resources for help but at this point I don’t know if I can continue the semester. I’d rather fail each class and start my journey to healing. However, I am also currently on the GI bill and I’m worried that if I fail all my classes it might put financial strain on my shoulders with debt. (I might have to pay it back) The problem is I am so sick at the moment deep into anorexia and depression that I’ve considered the idea that I may need to go back to the psych ward and stay for a longer period of time because I haven’t eaten in four days and I’m seriously considering suicide again while also struggling to live day to day as I constantly feel dizzy as if I’m going to pass out any day now. I’m on two medications and I’ve take five times the prescribed amount dosage for my antidepressant honestly wondering if it will kill me someday. Ultimately, I just wanna be okay. I think I should go back into psychiatric care and get help for my eating disorder and suicidal thoughts. I’m just very concerned about my coursework it’s the end of the semester but I genuinely don’t think I can continue. I am completely fine with failing my classes, but what should I do so I don’t put more financial strain on myself? Does anyone know about GI rules and exceptions? Also what should I do regarding my mental health?

Also, my small hallucinations are back, along with my paranoia. It’s not as bad, I’m just seeing small things so far. I saw a ghostly outline of white, like someone’s vest. I also saw shadows across the wall, a snake in my bathroom (?), hands reaching out the doorway, etc. These last very shortly though, and are usually gone with a blink of an eye. Usually.

That was the worst time of my life lol, they could never get the iv drip in my arm so it would always end up in my hand, it’d burn sometimes and I wouldn’t say anything because I thought I deserved it. On the way to the hospital my parents were also pulled over by the police which was insane because their 12 y/o child in the back seat’s liver could of gone into failure at any point. Luckily for me they ended up guiding our car to the hospital with their lights turned on. I understand why my parents were so panicked and I understand why they yelled now but at the time I just was wishing for a hug, for my mother to tell me everything would be all right, you know? My parents were very different people when raising my two half sisters, they were fucked up on drugs yk all that shabang. My dad was prone to anger outbursts and I never experienced that growing up until that night, it was genuinely terrifying. Anyways,A year later at 13 years old I did the same thing except with my antidepressants, my sister had told me to do it and I guess out of a moment of spite I did? I didn’t plan on surviving that time, although by the time my dad got home I had thrown up majority of the tablets and was just planning on cleaning it up and going about my day like normal, I ended up just sitting there on my bedroom floor with a disgusting amount of puke surrounding me.Again, I ended up at the hospital. I was told by the doctor that if I hadn’t thrown that up my heart would’ve likely stopped. That night my mother was crying on my hospital bed, holding my hand. She again kept asking me why and I felt so pathetic when she begged me to just talk to her but nothing would come out. She didn’t ask me to promise her not to do it again, I just did, because that was my mum crying over me like I was dead. My family mourning back at home as if i was gone. It was heartbreaking.Sometimes i still have thoughts of suicide, I still struggle with things such as self harm, and I really do just pray that one night I’ll go to bed and not wake up. I wish that would happen so deeply but then i remember the look on my big sister’s face when she came to visit me in the hospital and that hurts so bad.Suicide looks like an easy way out but I could never do that to my parents, to my sisters. To my nephew, to my grandparents. In such a big family i’m not seen or often heard but I know how much I mean to most of them now lol.Suicide is painful and trust me, no one deserves to die. And i hope you, whoever read my rant or whoever needs this, will realize that. You are loved, people cherish you, life is like a hike, you’re just at an extra rocky place but you can push through💗;When I was 12, a week before my birthday, I had overdosed on 52 Panadol and 34 ibuprofen, that obvio;;3;4;2024-04-16 12:46:45;2024-04-16;Tuesday;12:46:45;3038;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:34.826781

1c5f150;I was getting better but things are getting fucked up again;Old_Comedian_4540;I swear every time I begin to feel slightly better, things start fucking up again. I feel like a failure. I can’t have two days of peace without things crashing back down on me. I was so worried for my uni work and assignments, they would plague my mind. i was worried i was going to have to drop out or something, but things started looking up. I was getting assignments back for some of my modules and seeing grades like 75% and stuff which is so good for me, even exceeding my own expectations. I was beginning to slowly think everything would work out. Things were finally falling into the right place until one stupid module. we had a group assignment and normally for group assignments only one person has to submit it. I didn’t know for this one that everyone had to submit it, so I didn’t and neither did one of the other people in our group. And now i’ve got a 0 in that module. Our essay actually got 60%, but I got a 0 because I didn’t know everyone was supposed to submit it. Same module, I was supposed to do the test this morning before 12pm. I took a nap and set and alarm for 10am. My phone decides not to ring out, and it just so happens that I woke up at 12:20, 20 minutes after the due time. this is one of those compulsory modules where I have to get at least 40% in each assignment, but i’ve missed both of my last two. and with this completely simple act, i’ve fucked everything up. tomorrow is my birthday. I was looking forward to it for one of the first times in a while, but now i’ve fucked up the entire year with one module. and I don’t even care about my birthday now. I just wanna die now. my happiness only lasts for 2 days before something comes along again and ruins it. so typical.;I swear every time I begin to feel slightly better, things start fucking up again.

1c5ex7m;Why am i not able to commit suicide?;LookedMercury70;"So when i was a kid (maybe 7 or 8) i already didnt see the value of life and i told my parents that i wanted to die. They took me to a psychologist for 1 or 2 years and i was ""happy"" again. And 3 years back when i was 13 i became depressed and i didnt go to school for half a year, the next year i just didnt go to school or just once. I tried to go to school the year after so that was last year but i treathend someone because i wasnt used to people annymore. I got kicked out of that school and i got even deeper into my depression. A few weeks later i went to a new school and i make friends pretty quick so being lonely wasnt a problem. I didnt go to school much but i went so that was a start. The year was passed and i went to the same school and i even felt a bit better. A few months later I got expelled for 2 days because i smoked weed before going to school with a few friends. After that things were going backwards. I started staying home more often and the only thing i did at home was watching horror movies. I got intrusive thoughts about hurting other people and myself.(by hurting i also mean killing) I just stayed home because i thought myself as a danser to the world so the only thing i did was watch horror movies,game and watch porn. 2 months after that i tried to go to school again and it was alright. And now im just feeling that hatred again. Hatred of living. Hatred of humanity. The only people i see are my family and my psychologist because i dont go outside that often. I take my dog on walks so thats when i go outside. So my question. I've wanted to commit suicide a lot and i have also tried. Like hanging myself but still siting because i couldnt find annything big enough in my room to actualy hang myself. But everytime i stond up because i couldnt kill myself, is it because of my human instinct? I just hate living. And im tired of trying. Im 16 and have loving and caring parents. Im still going to a psychologist/therapist and i also take pills for my depression and adhd. Im just tired of life and everything. And even when wanting to die, i still fail. Im sorry for the long story, im from Europe so my english isnt that good. Can annyone just explain why im feeling these things and why i cannot kill myself.";So when i was a kid (maybe 7 or 8) i already didnt see the value of life and i told my parents that ;;3;5;2024-04-16 12:31:04;2024-04-16;Tuesday;12:31:04;2255;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:34.831100
1c5evtb;Is it bad that I want my boyfriend to die?;Salt-Tomorrow8686;Actually, you dont have to answer that, I know that the answer is yes.Recently, things hasn't been going so well for him so he's been down lately. And he would say that he wants to kill himself. He was mostly joking because we would make kms jokes all the time (we're still edgy minors btw).But right now he is feeling pretty down, and because of it only keeps tanking his performance. I know feeling down sometimes doesn't mean that you're about to full blown off yourself. But that doesn't mean you're 100% gonna not.So, why do I want him dead? Well guess what I've been wanting to kill myself for years. I was planning on it previous year, even made a very slobby plan I didnt follow through with. And ever since I met him I gained myself a new reason to live. But I dont think its gonna be enough, I dont know if I can pull through just for him. And that's what I'm scared of, I dont want him to blame himself or feel any grief or guilt because of my death. So I think it would be best if he died first, then I can take my life after. Me suggesting we do a double suicide wouldn't work because he wants me to live (He explicitly said that). This is very, very selfish of me but I wish he would follow me after I die. But i would have no way of knowing that.He could follow me, or he would have to suffer even more on this shitty planet, or perhaps he could live on and move on from it. But whatever the case is, I would still cause him immense pain. But if he were to go before me, he would have no way of knowing what happens next.And all I want is for him to think and believe that I stay strong and live happily with my life, even if it's a lie. I already don't have much reasons to live, anyone to care or be cared for besides him. That sounds very corny but it's the truth that I made up for myself. I've already crafted up many notes, ways of telling him my goodbye, and I dont want to use any of it. Honestly, if a miracle ever happens and we both lived happily ever I'm gonna cringe alot at this post. But now, the future is very bright and I don't like it, it blinds my vision.Maybe I'll update if something (good or bad) happens. I just wanna feel happy.;Actually, you dont have to answer that, I know that the answer is yes.Recently, things hasn't been g;;4;2;2024-04-16 12:29:09;2024-04-16;Tuesday;12:29:09;2168;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:34.832534
1c5eten;Extinguish the Sun;Round-Appearance7898;"Like an end to all of the world as we know it. No bombshelter bullshit, or prepping to survive. Even if one would survive, there would be noone and nothing else left.This ""wish"" or hope gives me some sort of peace.Because suicide is more like a fantasy to me, than an actual option. My parents, my sister and a handfull of good friends would be hurt and perhaps blame themselves if I'd end myself. I would've prefered that it would be an actual ""backupplan"" though.The thought of losing any of them breaks my heart already, and I truly hope my time runs out first, as to be sure that I wouldn't ever have to mourn them.It sounds very selfish, I know... Thats why a total wipeout of everything that existed is ideal in my eyes.For the better part of 15years now (I'm in my 30s) I've struggled keeping up a ""mask"" or facade just to run along with what society expects from us. There have been times where I was happy, sure. Most recently this happened (ended) 2 maybe 3 years ago. During covid.Then I lived a life I never imagined was possible, I was lucky enough to be in a situation where I didn't have to work for an employer, didn't have rent or most of the usual monthly payments, and lived a very minimalistic yet simpel life. Together with a great partner who shared the same beliefs and felt similarly about the world we live in.With her I could drop the facade, release the mask and actually show myself in a way I've only did with 2 or 3 very close friends. She wasnt just my girlfriend, she was (is) also a best friend.All we did for work, was taking care of ourselves to provide for ourselves and other than that we smoked pot whenever we liked, we fucked, laughed, took naps whenever we liked.This ended a few years ago, first the lifestyle (for me), when I got a new job and appartment, and I found myself back into this hamsterwheel, chasing the cheese.Immediatly I felt the stress returning. The disgust of society and hatred toward the regular, 9-5 routine.Needless to say, this (amongst other reasons) didnt improve the relationship we were having, and this too ended 2 years ago. I still miss her tremendously. (you got me, it is ofcourse a heartbreak/sad romance story that got me here)We are still in touch, but after 2 years I'm beginning to lose any hope of picking this back up with her, nomatter how badly I want to. She seems to have moved on with her live, and being friends with me is apparently enough for her. And at this point, I don't see anything I can or should do to convince her otherwise.And even though in these last 2 years, I've experienced some good times. But this was more of a day here and there. Perhaps a weekend. And then this void would present itself again.Loneliness, anger and mostly a form of grief are feelings that are constantly with me.It got to the point that on a daily basis, I visually think of a revolver, and the taste of the barrel.Or how the fibers of rope would feel around my throat... Or: what if I just let go of the steeringwheel one day... These admittedly dark thoughts actually give me some relief. A feeling of freedom even.But, as I've said in the beginning, I'd hate to leave behind someone who cares for me who'll be hurt or feel guilty or whatever. So I struggle on through life.Life equals suffering, as Buddhism has taught me.But this struggle, this pace of survivalism in the daily routine, makes me more and more careless.I don't care about my job, or my future, very little interest in the hobbies I used to enjoy, or whatever. Let alone my wellbeing.. I think I've read somewhere that there's a name for this. Like a passive suicidal state or something.I try to make most of the day. Live it like it could be my last. In other words: I try to enjoy it, here and now. It's my overthinking that often gets in the way of doing so. Then I'll find myself in an almost katatonic state of mind, and general unease or annoyance in my daily routine. Like: what if I get hit by a bus tomorrow? (Yay) That would mean I used my last hours working for a boss who doesnt care about me, paying bills and taxes to a government who doesnt care about me, but worst of all: being mentally stuck in a vicious circle of overthinking and missing someone who used to love me, but also missing a live that feels as if it has been taken away from me.The fact that there is such a stigma around suicide (and mental health in general) also makes this worse in my opinion. Whenever I do feel the need to talk about this subject, most people (not just family or loved ones, also therapists or people who are supposed to help) say stuff like ""no, you have so much to live for"" or some generic shit like that. There is hardly anyone who I actually can have a genuine conversation with regarding these feelings or this topic. My best friend, and ex excluded. With them, I was able to. They understood. But if the people who you can talk to are the same whose absence from your life cause the pain you are in... Well that's anothere paradox to this whole predicament.";Like an end to all of the world as we know it. No bombshelter bullshit, or prepping to survive.

1c5eovy;If god is real, he would let me die in my sleep. ;Last-Major4114;It’s selfish that I can’t kill myself because of the impact it would leave on the people around me. I have been in and out of suicidal thoughts for the past 2 months and it’s not getting any easier. I want to disappear. My brain doesn’t function properly and I just don’t know what to do. August last year my husband decided he wanted to separate. That killed me. But I think where I truly lost my soul was 2020. It first started with a missed miscarriage which absolutely ripped my heart in half. Then I had seizures which led to a temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosis. Then after that my dad passed away due to cancer. A few months into 2021 my best friend committed suicide. I have accepted that my soul has been lost since then. Now coming back to my current state. Since my husband and I seperated (still living under the same roof) it’s been hard. I have started seeing a new person and he’s been so above and beyond it’s hard for me to grasp my head around why I deserve to be treated in such a way. Now leads me to my thoughts. He has a child with his ex (no problems all good) but now my brain is torturing me with the thoughts like “what would my life have been like if I didn’t lose my baby.” My soul died when my baby died. And now I am just confused what do I do with my life. I just want to sleep forever.;It’s selfish that I can’t kill myself because of the impact it would leave on the people around me. ;;1;10;2024-04-16 12:19:20;2024-04-16;Tuesday;12:19:20;1315;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:34.835092

Had an abusive stepfather since I was 9, he was awful. My bio dad was not interested in me, never was a good relationship and I haven’t seen him in at least 25 years. I’m now estranged with my only sibling, an older brother, was never a close relationship either, we were spilt up when my parents divorced. The only people who I loved and were close to, have all died. ( my mom and maternal grandparents) I’m especially having a hard time with my mother’s death. Life has been very lonely and lost without her. I am married, miserable marriage. He treats me like utter shit 💩. I can’t leave due to ongoing health and mental issues. I’m estranged from my son, and his 3 young boys. My son is a narcissistic selfish person. I do have a lovely daughter, only good thing in my life. But it is no longer enough to keep me going anymore, she has her own life and no children. I suffer from may ailments both physically and mentally. In constant pain. I suffer from severe anxiety disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, PSTD, severe agoraphobia, never leave the house. Phobias etc… you name it. My husband treats me like crap, constantly like walking on eggshells with him, so unhappy and miserable marriage. I hate when he is home. Lost both my dogs a few years back, miss them so much, kept me going. Now hubby won’t let me get another pet, even a cat, he says no. I’m stuck at home, sick all the time, with no life. I really want it to end, I’ve had enough. I was going to apply for MAID, but then the government has put in on the back burner till 2027 for people suffering mental illness. I wake up every single day wanting it to end. I have no life, no job, bad health, both physical and mental. No money, no nothing.

1c5dr8i;Thinking of jumping;Future_Soil_6580;I feel like I'm in trouble and I know I brought it upon myself, but I don't want to go into great detail about it. I'm scared and worried. I'm catastrophizing, which is one of my bad habits. I just wish there was somebody who would reach out and put their hand on my shoulder and tell me I'm a good person and that everything is okay, nothing is going to happen, everything will be fine, you are safe. I'm not a bad person. Right now I'm staying on the 14th floor. Yesterday I was sitting on the edge of the open window, feeling the breeze and thinking of reasons not to jump. That was before any of this. I considered myself already worthless before any of this. The ground below is empty and nobody else will get hurt when I jump. I'm a worthless, strange human being.

1c5dnza;Honestly, how do i take my life easily?;HistorianOk5555;Well the title says it I have been suicidal ever since I was a kid. And now I just wanna end it. I have a really toxic family, I have no future, i am disgusting and my life is honestly pointless, tried to end it first time when I was between 7-8 years old. And now I’m just so done, I have tried to have a will to live but nothing works, I have realized that I’m not meant for this at all, I literally wrote my first sucide letter in my pink diary when I was a kid. And now to my question, how do I kill myself in the easiest less painful way? I don’t have as many access’s to stuff, maybe pills but nothing to extra.

1c5di4u;This is the worst year of my life;Newguydonthurtme;To start off the year, my grandmother, the last person I really had a connection with in my family, died a few days after I visited her in America. The rest of my America trip I ended up stuck in another state with someone who I no longer got along with and couldn’t even go to her funeral. While there I got in an argument with my spouse over the phone in which they said I wasn’t in touch enough while visiting home and blamed me for  some problems their mom was causing. I was incredibly apologetic but maintained my boundaries. They said some really hurtful things on top of everything.I finally got home and was so happy to see my partner again, only to immediately be told in the car at the airport that they apparently cheated on me with a loved one while I was gone, only a couple days after I left. The whole time they were calling and texting and stressing me they had already been cheating on me.They blamed it all on me. Said my disability made me a burden. Said I’m too depressed. Said I don’t put out enough.I tried to still make things work but after a while it was obvious they were still sneaking behind my back. We finally broke up and I said I want a divorce. Best part of that conversation was when I asked them if I gave them another chance would they even be able to stop cheating and they said “that’s like if I asked you to stop cutting yourself” 🙃A few days later we got a package from their mom. It was hate mail directed to me. Included notes calling me a slut, saying I have stds, saying I’m gonna ruin their life and I’m a bad spouse. It also included an art print of Medusa that was meant to be me. She was and still is unaware we separated.Through all this I found out I might have cancer. A large lump in my chest that keeps growing. I was going to monthly appointments with no straight answers. Finally got a sort of answer yesterday. They don’t know what it is, but they want to surgically remove it to stop the growth especially since there’s now two of them. This means I will have to stay in another country with my ex spouse for even longer while filing for divorce.I have next to no money, they now want me to finish paying off everything they bought me after I move out.I told my abusive mother after 3 months separated because I needed help and don’t have anyone anymore. Now she’s calling me almost every 12 hours day or night and freaking out if I don’t immediately answer. She’s demanding I come home to her right now even tho I need my surgery etc. She’s also making me incredibly paranoid. Saying my ex is plotting against me, probably wants to murder me, wants to detain me against my will, is gonna start hitting me, and that they’re trying to throw their credit debt on me through the divorce.I’m in hell. Idk what else to say. I can’t do this anymore.;To start off the year, my grandmother, the last person I really had a connection with in my family, ;;0;2;2024-04-16 11:15:58;2024-04-16;Tuesday;11:15:58;2801;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:34.851885

1c5d4fd;Think I'm going to do it.;Fair_Put8542;Honestly people may consider it selfish but I feel I have no one I can relate too at all. I have a girlfriend , a good degree and I have hobbys I love. But It all feels fruitless like I'm working for someone else's profit. Just another mindless number to get bent over whenever the tories want a pay rise. And for my partner I fucking hate her the only  reason. I'm still with her is due to the fact she's still in education and she has this almost weird fanatical view of me like some sort of religious zealot if I were to break up with her it would be detrimental to her as she's round the corner from exams. I feel guilty every minute I'm alive I understand and can sort of empathise that people would want to be in my position but I feel nothing but apathy and melancholy towards the world. It all feels like a frivolous scurry to a somewhat upwards position so I can let someone's rich auntie or daddy's special boy with a god complex because he's never experienced strive or even had a reevaluation of themselves after doing anything fuck me and everyone else over. They just drown it all out with a cocktail slurry of tik tok, sex and mid tier drugs. I see people on their phones and it pisses me off no one engages in the hobbies I enjoy because they can't do it on their phone with fun bright lights to keep their melted dopamine Receptors disintegrated into a ignoramus mush.

1c5d32y;Idk what to do anymore...;PlanetEarthIsWeird;"Edit: I get really bad intrusive thoughts... the main ones are throwing myself in front of a train/jumping off a bridge... if anyone has any suggestions to help ease that... I would greatly appreciate it 🙏🏻 I drank with my friend Sunday night and did some cocaine. We hung out. And it was fine till things got super overwhelming being around people. Plus, I had to hide from this toxic girl she likes because had this girl seen me... it would have been super bad my friend said.That made me feel like shit. And you'd think when we hung out she'd be more open to listening to my concerns... she was talking over me almost the entire time. And I have such a pet peeve about that. And it might also be trauma from family not listening to me growing up...etc.Anyways... I left her house a little after 9 AM yesterday. I took a nice walk. I kept drinking after getting home. Listened to music in the afternoon. When the evening hit... everything hit me at once. Everything I've been going through and trying to shove down.So I started bawling my eyes out. And I got the point where I just didn't care if my mom and her boyfriend saw/heard me. She saw me, asked me if I was OK (mind you I play the parent role with her usually) and I told her I was depressed. Then she was like ""oh the new bass you got isn't helping?"" (I'm a musician... and I did get a nice bass guitar recently to start playing after years of not playing) And that question felt very dismissive. Like of course music helps me. It's one of the only reasons I am still alive. But my bass can only do so much to help.8:30 in the evening I decided I had enough being awake. So I took my night meds... only this time instead of 2mg klonopin and 50mg seroquel... I took 3mg of klonopin... then that turned into 4mg.I never do that. At the time I was depressed and felt like dying. I know I'd obviously have to take a lot more in order to OD. But it says a lot for me that I did that.I'm tired of my town and the toxic people. They're mostly alcoholics/drug addicts. Sometimes I wanna go far away and change my name... start a new life.I know I have to try harder at being healthy. It's just so hard when I don't have a support system... and I'm traumatized by previous therapists.I'm sorry for the vent... I just don't know what to do anymore. And I feel like God forbid something bad happens to me... basically no one will care. I'm sure most will be glad I'd be gone for good. I'm never enough for anyone else... and I've been trying to be enough for myself/show up for myself but it's such a struggle.";Edit: I get really bad intrusive thoughts... the main ones are throwing myself in front of a train/j;;0;3;2024-04-16 10:51:38;2024-04-16;Tuesday;10:51:38;2561;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:34.857947

1c5ci3c;the end is near;Personal_Tonight5181;I’ve had my suicide planned out for about 6 years now. I am going to do it soon after graduating highschool…which is next month. i’ve held off from fulling committing for some years now so it’s kinda relieving to know that it will be over soon.There is no talking me out of doing this, so don’t bother. i’m a little scared that i won’t be able to do it the way i have wanted and at the time i had planned, do to personal reasons. however it will get done no matter what. I’ve began to appreciate life more as my time has dwindled. i don’t appreciate living, but more the concept, how strange it is that i’m able to type this problem of mine with a way of communication from years of evolving onto a device that emits light from tiny pixels. how strange it is that we are this insignificant in the universe yet everything means everything to us. how strange the world is, a big rock that coincidentally has all the necessities for a civilized society to form, a civilization too smart for their own good. i guess what i’m getting at is, i am beginning to miss living though i am alive. i wont be able to miss living if im dead so i am right now. at first i thought maybe i was having second thoughts but i was wrong. i’ve put much thought into this, more than i think anything else in my life. i spent my entire life thinking about the end rather than the present. if things could be different then i’d choose for things to be different rather than ending my life. but that’s just isn’t the case. it’s not that i don’t want to live so much as i just don’t want to be existent. i no longer want to feel, feel sad, feel guilty, feel tired or alone. i am sick of it. i don’t want to think anymore, i don’t want to think about all the cruel things that have happened to me, especially all the cruel things i have done. a man i met once said “Smart people tend to feel sadder because they think deeply. When you think a lot, you may find yourself dwelling on sadder things more often.”-unknown. i’m not saying i’m “smart”, i just think i am too aware and cognitive for my own good. i’ve been trying to do as much for my family as i can before i go. i’ve began a garden in the backyard that my mom always wanted, fixed the boat my dad wanted to take out to the lake, spoiled my younger siblings the best i could. among many other things. i know i will leave my family heartbroken, im not going to sit here and sound stupid by saying no one cares about me. i know people do. i feel guilty as i know i am going to hurt them. but i am truly burdening this family with my medical bills, legal troubles, and down and out personality. i’ve began to save up money to cover my funeral so im not leaving them with one more thing to worry about. i’m doing this for them.there’s a lot more i could add, maybe if anyone wants to know more of my situation or just wants to talk, i am always open. i hope to whoever reads this that you are doing well. if you’re on this subreddit because you are thinking about ending it, please don’t. i know it’s very hypocritical of me to say. just do not, especially if you have the chance to change things around.;I’ve had my suicide planned out for about 6 years now.

1c5bs2q;I will commit suicide if I don't leave schools;Other-Radio-900;Okay so need a little help. I'm a 15F and basically last year when I was in year 9 and I decided to move schools for more opportunity/better education for year 10. I decided to move back to my old school (That i haven't attended in 3 years.)  At the time this seemed like a good idea, and even though at the time I knew I was leaving my friends/memories, I felt like this was a good idea. Though I wish I didn't feel like this. I regret moving schools.To make this easier to explain lets name the school I regret moving to School 1 and the school I wanna move back to School 2. Basically as soon as I stepped back into School 1 I felt out of place. The last time I saw these people was in year 6 and they were so much more different, which I knew was to be expected but still it felt weird seeing these people. I still was in contact with my friend group in School 1 so I didn't have to worry about being alone at lunch. The problem is that these friends are not as mature as me and I didn't really realize this until I started hanging out with them. Our interests and hobbies are not really the same and I don't feel happy when I'm with then. Don't get me wrong in primary school these people were so nice and they still are, its just that I don't fit in with them anymore and I can't join a different friend group because I wouldn't fit in with them either. Its a small school so there is only like 50 students in our year level and majority of them are the popular kids which I would not fit in as they are very sporty and extroverted and I'm not. There is also the nerdy/gamer people which is not me at all. There is also some other groups but in this case I just wont fit in at all. I hate feeling like this, I feel alone all the time even though I have people around me. I always miss my old friends and wish that at recess and lunch I was with them at School 2.Another reason why I wanna move is because the school I go to is an IB program not VCE which I am use to for high school. There is nothing wrong with IB i just find the workload a lot more different and I felt more comfortable doing VCE. I also can't stand how small the school is, idk how to explain it, its like I constantly feel trapped.I just really miss my old friends, wearing my old uniform, taking my old school bus. Everything I miss everything.I've only been here for two terms and I already committed suicide twice during those two terms, because I felt like if I was to go all the stress, problems and loneliness would be gone. I tried taking pills the first time, but I just threw them all up and the second time I tried grabbing a knife but I backed out. I also have social anxiety, so I feel like everyone hates me and the world would be a better place without me. And before anyone says give it some time you'll get use to it. I can't get use to this. I cannot stand being here I just hate it. I will not get use to this and the longer I stay here the more I am going up to my breaking point.Now you might be thinking to yourself, why not tell your parents to move you back? well here is the thing. Finances in my family is not that great and School 1 is very expensive when it comes to school fees, I also had to pay for new uniforms and books to go to this school. I've only been here for two terms and If I tell my parents to move me back to School 2 for next semester, I feel like I just wasted all my parents money and time for no reason. I also made it a big deal last year to move schools even though my parents told me it was expensive. I wish I wasn't so selfish at the time.I am also scared to tell my parents how I feel and why I wanna move schools, my mum is understanding and my dad is like a basic Indian dad (always angry all the time). I feel like if I tell my mum I'm suicidal and wanna move schools she will feel worries and stressed and if she tells my dad this idk how he would react. I'm not sure if he will be upset at me or stressed. I am also scared if I tell my parents, I will get my hopes up to high and they will tell me I cant move back or my old school will not allow me to come back in term 3.I know that if I do not move out of this school and go back in term 3 I will not be alive anymore. I really am impatient and I am slowly losing control. I can only hold on for so little and I feel like crying every single minute. If I can't go back to School 2, where I was a lot happier, I am gonna stab myself or do anything so that I won't suffer anymore because I can't keep praying to God every night to kill me in my sleep or waking up every morning and getting ready knowing I am gonna go to a place I hate. If I am able to move schools and go back to my old school next semester, then at least I am able to know that I only have a term left of misery and things will go back to normal when I move back.I have made a plan to tell my mum how I feel and tell her I'm really suicidal and I wanna move back to schools. Idk how to do it or when is the right time. Please can someone help me on how I can tell my mum this and prepare myself for my dads reaction when my mum tells my dad later on. I am really struggling right now and I pray every single day that I can go back to my old school.;Okay so need a little help.

1c5b2b9;I want to kill myself but I don't have the balls to do it;Terrible_Battle7916;"Hi. Im 27 yo male, and ive been thinking about suicide every day since i was a child. This is the quite boring and cringe story of my life. I was born in a middle class family with both parents i had a decent education although my dad was a raging alcoholic. I was constipated and I shit myself everyday until like 5 years old because i couldnt control it. This led to trauma because I was constantly mocked by other children and sometimes beaten by the female kindergarten teachers when they found out. I tried to hide this issue as much as possible from my parents. Over time I became a very turbulent child because i wanted to attract attention,  so constantly being the clown or being fired changing schools etc.. Then something weird happened, I don't know how but I got over sexualized, maybe I was abused in my early childhood or maybe it was because of the school I was in which was very ""alternative"", but basically when i was 8 years old we started to ""play doctor"" with a girl the same age, and eventually we had sex, multiple times. We knew it was wrong and we hid from people. But after a while she wanted to stop, and I didn't. I was half ass raping her at times and being very insistant. I tried to erase all of this from my memory but as I grew up I realized how uncommon/fucked up this is (even on the internet people in this situation are few and far in between), I still feel very guilty and weirded out about this to this day.Middle school was the worse, no friends, was bullied, but sometimes i was the bully too to feel accepted. I had very intrusive suicide thoughts already, and would often lie to my parents about being sick just out of depression and fear going to school.I was rejected in all the social groups I got into so you get the memo in your head that if you're rejected everywhere you are the problem. Then in high school it got better. made some friends, i was starting to be more confident, extravert etc, and even had a girlfriend for a few months. But when we broke up I was devastated, like way too much for what it was, i cried so much. I started very bad habits, smoking weed everyday, binge drinking every week, and even more procrastination. That's also when I started to realize the scope of my mental health issues, i always knew i was fucked up but started to make sense of it. Very anxious, obsessed with what other people think, ashamed of myself, low self esteem, talking to myself all the time, depersonalisation, mood changes, perfectionnism, lying and deceiving friends for no reason etc... but one more than others, I have a sort of truman show syndrome and extreme procrastination stuff mixed in with OCD which I will try to explain.Again this is not diagnosed but i will say to myself ""I start to turn my life around on April 17th at midnight"" So I will do a sort of ritual, make sure there is no imperfect things around me like I will for example subscribe to 1000 YouTube channel before so its a perfect number. If I have money I can spend it so it falls exactly at 1000 euros left. I will clean my apartment to an extreme maniac level to make sure I'm fully prepared for midnight, things like that. Once it starts, i think people watch me and my life and so I try to act perfect, saying perfect things (talking to myself so they can hear me) and make sure i am 100% perfect and not say anything cringe/make mistake or be uncomfortable around people. The problem is, it always end up happening a day or another. So then usually after a few days I give up, have an existential crisis, and prepare for another one a week later or so, ""this time it will work"". While I'm not after a midnight try, I will do nothing at all, dont clean, dont try, avoid people and so on, since it will all magically fix the next week when this time it will be real. This led to having different personalities and people kinda notice.Been doing that for ten years, hundreds of times, week after week, and year after year, went so fast, but a lot happened since. After high school I dropped out of college , twice. I gradually pushed myself away from my friends, becauae I was always getting way too drunk at parties which led to me crying or get angry. As I felt very guilty every time i still did it again and again and again to the point it eventually ruined my life and that of other people. At 19 I grabbed a woman ass at a party, no one knew, I apologised, but I get guilty ever since. Then at 21, I got arrested driving drunk and high while speeding. I also insulted cops (can't remember much) so yeah I avoided jail by a thread but had my license revoked and a criminal record. Later on I purposefully spent my 10k inheritance from my grandparents into booze, weed and giving it away to charity in like 5 months, because I thought I didn't deserve it. My mom was mad, but I went back to her place for a while. There I really isolated entirely from all my remaining friends and became a full NEET, not working, I spent my entire days smoking weed and on the internet , which had a toll of its own on my mental health lol.I got into some pretty bad rabbitholes and incel stuff. I was very sexually frustrated, in a weird position since I was both not virgin since 8 but also never fucked ever since. Also I have incest porn addiction. Even the few times I was approached by women right after high school, I rejected the opportunity out of lack of confidence. I never hated women, I know Incel stuff is bullshit, but I have those constant intrusive thoughts and despair regarding women. This got the point I entirely avoid talking to any of them in fear that they realize my incel thoughts or think I'm weird. So as I isolated myself over time I also got into a bad sunken cost mentality, that since I was already 23 year old and a total loser, that would define me forever. The more time passes the more you think this is too late.In spite of all this, there is one (weird) thing im obsessed with since I'm a child, it is a deep fascination for the usa. This has kept me going over time. I spent days, months, looking at google maps, learning about the country, watching american medias and TV shows etc... and it basically hit a couple years ago, that since I don't have the balls to kill myself anyway, I should try to turn my life around and emigrate there. A high school friend of mine who didn't give up on me also helped pull me out of this spiral.Since then I have been doing retail amd restaurant jobs, started making new friends around. Although I know I'm very immature and strange, but I try to force myself to appear confident and appear funny etc... despite my very low self esteem. So after a while I even managed to get a girlfriend, and so I finally break that 16 year drought lol, and it started good, I felt so happy like never before, I tried to do my best for her etc... but several things made it complicated. I wasnt really attracted to her tbh, I just wanted to try something and I realized it is extremely selfish. Also, we werent that compatible as she was much older and I felt like an immature teen next to het friends in their 30s, all working 5k tech jobs and me being a waiter, felt out of place. Anyways, we were both with our own confidence issues and relationship slowly faded and we eventually broke up in good terms. One other thing is that I suck at sex. I have both erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation, which means 2 minutes of nothing for me and the other person. That is odd since I never had that issue by myself when I masturbate. So some time after we broke up I went to sex workers, I wanted to just have more confidence and try to have normal sex but both times didn't get hard. And yet both my girlfriend and the sex workers told me I have a big dick, but i just have too low confidence and too much depression I think. I realize all this may have to do with the fucked up things I did in my childhood, but the issue is its a spiral, im depressed because I feel lonely and can't do anything because im depressed. Just like I smoke pot because im depressed and the more I smoke the more worthless I feel.Anyways after that I moved to another city and now im trying to get my life back together, but I struggle. Switching jobs, no friends here, just a shitty weird life. The only reason im still alive is I don't want to hurt my mom by killing myself. And I can still watch the American idiocracy shitshow unfold from the other side of the altantic. Most of the time I just really wish I was born in a perfect middle class suburban american family with no mental issues. But I know that it's a dream and I probably would have the same personal issues even there (and also im still grateful to be born here and not third world but again i feel guilty about that) And im not sure America needs another degenerate pothead. Recently this took a different turn. I got into religion and realized the LDS church is the best option. It's an american made religion, they frown upon addictions like alcohol and tobacco and they have a sense of love and community which I desperately need. They also emphasise traditional gender roles and protect children from sex influences which given my peculiar experience is very important to me. The issue however is that I don't believe a single word of the Bible nor the book of mormon. It's all made up but I realise everything is, so I may soon convert, the only thing is I'm worried for now is how my mom would react since she's very anti religion. I also went to see a therapist for a while but I was paying 80 euros an hour to hear things I already knew. It would have taken years if not an entire life lol and im broke af anyways. I tried to apply some of it though step by step, to break the procrastination cycle and forgive myself. But how do i forgive myself after all the shit ive done? All the violent, cringe and sad stuff that makes most of my life? I've hurt people and ive hurt myself, it seems i cant let go of the past and unconsciously self punish myself into oblivion because I think I deserve to die. She also told me I might be on the autistic spectrum but I never got diagnosed and when I looked it up, a lot of symptoms don't match. I know I have some severe mental issues though, sometimes I think my place is more in an asylum than out here lol.So yeah I'm at this point I'm lost, I am.constantly bored and depressed, can't even enjoy anything or laugh, I try to pull myself out at least working jobs, but I usually quit after 6 months. I hesitate between killing myself or go all in and change my life and try to emigrate to the promised land, but for that I would first need to 1)Hire a lawyer to get rid of my criminal record 2)Get back to college 3)Manage to get a work visa or a green card lottery, which in itself is hard enough to get. Anyways, ill try on the 17th and well see where it goes. Probably going to want to violently kill myself on the 18th and drink myself to sleep because I said cringe things while talking to myself which people in my head mocked me for. Yeah...Please save me";Hi. Im 27 yo male, and ive been thinking about suicide every day since i was a child.

1c5awbh;I realized i have to be smarter about it;avocadoswag;I have seriously wanted to die since i was maybe 15 or 16. I had thoughts before that, but that was the age I started trying. I've overdosed on my prescription meds a handful of times, I've been in inpatient, outpatient, seen multiple therapists, psychiatrists, taken the meds, done the work for about 10 years now. But every time something really bad happens (a loved one does, I have a breakup, I get cheated on, I lose a friend, I do poorly in school) I can't help but fantasize about ending it all. Every time I do something mean or embarrassing my instinct is I have to disappear and end it all. I just keep making the mistake of failing. I catch myself trying to jump off an overpass or run into traffic, I take pills and just end up in the ER or waking up the next morning feeling like shit. So I've started making plans for a more permanent end. My job right now is so stressful, I just went through a breakup and I have no friends in my city, and people keep telling me I can't just quit. So I'm going to just end my suffering. I'm buying a car soon. I'm going to drive it far enough away that no one can find me until it's too late, I'm going to take my anti anxiety meds, and I'm going to use an exit/suicide bag to inhale helium and deprive my brain of oxygen until I just pass out and die without realizing. It's so foolproof, there's no going back. If I'm not acting on impulse I'll surely be able to carry it out. I feel bad for whoever has to find me, maybe if anyone has any tips on how to alert authorities but not fast enough that they will be able to stop me that would be helpful. This plan is about a month in the making, I'm already collecting all of the supplies. I need to make sure I do it right this time. I'm sorry to my one true friend and my dad, but I don't really have anyone else that will miss me.;I have seriously wanted to die since i was maybe 15 or 16.

1c5ad7m;Decided to finally do it;Decidedtodoitpeace;I’ve tried a couple times before. Heroin overdose twice. Didn’t work.  Pills and booze once before, didn’t work. Once after didn’t work. I’m in my 40s now, and when my wife decided to leave me a couple years ago, I met her at our last Thanksgiving dinner, and tried again. I went home, grabbed the gun I had secretly bought, after secretly taking shooting lessons when she had her one day to herself each week, went to the hotel I secretly booked, and put the gun in my mouth, pointed up towards my brains, and pulled. 9mm Glock has the least chance of any handgun misfires. It was even on sale. I’d practiced the motion alone in the woods on the weekends, so I wouldn’t chicken out. I even wore hearing and eye protection.  It didn’t go off. I went and had lunch and watched a movie in my roof, after a drink at the bar downstairs.  Tried again, and another misfire. Once on the bed. Second in the tub. Thought it was hilarious. Threw the gun in the trash dumpster behind the restaurant downstairs. Wrapped it in newspapers and wiped it clean.  Now, 1 1/2 years later, I’ve bought another. Found a place in the woods near our house we bought together. No one can see me, I’ve check by making a fire.  Also, no one will notice my car is gone because I can walk there in about an hour.  When she takes the dogs to her moms, I’ll feed the cat. Leave my phone at home with my id and cards in it.

1c59swr;I just want it to be over;Inside-Ad-B213;I'm thinking about suicide again. I'm 18f, I was diagnosed bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder like...5, 6 years ago? This starts to feel like destiny to me, like I'm meant to be melancholic and depressed for the rest of my life. I started to feel better at the start of 2024 and I thought things are gonna get better. I quit my medicine and therapy (mainly because I don't want my family to waste more money on these things, especially when the people that 'treated' me doesn't even gaf, I live in a country that mental issues are heavily neglected). But it's getting to me again. Those thoughts I can't get it out of my head. I have no friends at all, online or irl. I have no one to talk to. It's not that I mind, I kinda already got used to it. One thing I hate about myself is that I always live to impress. It's exhausting and soooo much pressure. I'm never good enough, there'll always be someone better than me. I'm jealous and it's painful. I know I have problems, hell, I even know what problems I have. But I can't fix it. And I don't have the motivation to do so. Suicide seems like the quickest and most effective solution of all.I attempted suicide a few years ago. I used to have a few friends, they called my parents and 'saved' me. I didn't want to be saved. I wish I locked the door and succeeded. I used to have serious problems with my parents, that's what makes the suicide a few years ago so much easier than now. We changed, we grew. We learned to tolerate each other. If I suicide now, it's gonna ruin their lives, my grandma grandpa's lives. They cared, I kinda don't want them to feel bad.I don't even know why I'm saying these. Okay probably because part of me doesn't want to die, I guess...I don't know what more can be said.;I'm thinking about suicide again.

1c59pl5;Like 16 years later;nomishkaa;I went into an inpatient psych ward after tearing myself up pretty bad and i had already made a few attempts by this time. My mom had me looked at by a hospital, which I really wish she didn't, like I'd have rathered talk to someone else after the cuts healed and i couldve waited that long. I still get sentimental about that time i spent in there and its the only reason ill buy myself fig newtons cause i remember having them every day at meetings. At that time I had felt that way for years already. Like since I was 7. I was confused all the time and everything thing I did seemed to get me trouble or embarass myself. I'd go out with friends when I was supposed to be doing homework since I just really needed that and I didn't care that I'd get beat for it. Eh anyway, the grippy fun place told me I have bipolar, psychotic depression, and adhd (I don't think I have adhd though). I stopped taking the meds shortly after when I said I made all of it up to live with my dad in another state - I didn't, nor did I care to live with him, it was just - away. Ended up not being a horrible idea, I tend to forget a lot of the parts where my dad really changed the way I look at things now. But being around that much alcohol and drugs + other alcoholic/druggies every day wasn't exactly helpful. I still get the feelings, recently had a self harm incident worse than I ever did before, and have been having thoughts again. At kind of a weird point now since I've had these feelings for so long deciding if I just give it another go or just disappear somewhere. I feel like I know I'm going to try again because I'm too worried about what my family and people who have cared about me would say or think. And I kinda at least wanna leave a lengthy note or project of some sort behind. Mostly cause I don't trust some of these mfs and they'd act like they had no clue when I can't imagine how anyone could be that fucking dense at this point. Anyway, I see some of your guys' posts and replies, I'll see how things go and even posting here helps a little bit. But it's definitely getting harder and harder to keep going and I don't have insurance or anything to help afford therapy or anything. I wish I didn't feel like I was guilt tripped by other people that I wouldn't even have to worry about if I did quit. But I'm sure as hell not watching myself die slowly either, so I guess I better make this attempt count cause I'm running out of fuel to keep getting back up and i know eventually these things holding me back won't be there. Theres some things i like about living but mostly a lot of stuff i feel like is corrupt, horrible, unlucky, and just kinda fucked up sometimes. Hopefully you guys that are considering something tonight try to keep finding a reason to give life a little extra try. For me, it's been rough but most of the time I've kept going after it got really bad I had some really big life changing things that i really enjoyed after that I wouldn't have otherwise....also wouldn't have messed them up either but....I'd imagine it's possible to not mess up friendships and stuff too. Anyway, it's not very motivational but hope you guys make it another night and try to look for something to go another extra push. I'm running out of steam to keep doing it too but I'm also apparently too weak to commit either..but it also reminds me how I was too weak to commit to leaving my family when I was a kid until I was 14 until I eventually did too.;I went into an inpatient psych ward after tearing myself up pretty bad and i had already made a few ;;1;4;2024-04-16 07:00:23;2024-04-16;Tuesday;07:00:23;3467;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:35.752091

I know im really young and i hope im not some edgy teen. My step mom has no clue about my mental health, in front of my family im a normal fuctioning person. My dad constantly yells at me for sometimes being sad which sounds really stupid. I dont cut myself, but i scratched my wrist pretty badly on axsident and my dad thought i cut myself and started yelling at me for it calling me emo and saying a bunch of messed up shit, i love my dad but i dont like him at all. I share a room with my step brother, he is genuinly the worst person i know, i cant get a break from it. Im constantly surrounded by people, people i dont like to be specific, im never physicly alone, But somehow im so lonely. I have no one. Im the most hurt ive ever been in my life right now. At school im a fucking loser, no one likes me, im the weird annoying kid i guess. But this girl liked me, and we started talking. I know to adults kid realationships sound stupid but try to understand. She was really the only reason i looked foward to waking up. Most nights i hoped i wouldnt wake up in the morning but when we started talking that changed. But of course it goes wrong right? Me and her get in some argument about something stupid and she says the whole we should stop talking thing, and then she texts me in a like a week and things go back to normal. This had happened like 4 times. But this time it was fr. The thing is that she really likes me, and i dont understand why. Im a peice of shit loser no one likes, shes called me a pathological liar and shes right. The thing is im afraid of myself, theres something serouisly wrong with me, i am not ok at all. I want it all to end. I cant handle this much pain anymore. Ive been numb to everything for the past year. My life has gotten so much worse. I thought it was bad then. Someone please tell me u understand. She was all i had and now shes gone to. All i feel is stress anxiety pain depression and FEAR. The only reason i havent killed myself is because of my religion. Im a christian, not that i live by it anyway. But i think god has a plan for me, weather u reading this are religious or not GOD is the only reason i havent ended it. I already know what i would do, how i would do it. I plan it out in my head, i plan ""smool smooting"" in my head, ""deleting"" everyone who is mean to me for no reason. I feel like im sick in the head. I see things that arent there sometimes and i hear voices rarely. I hallucinated a conversation with the girl i talked about earlier, then i opened my texts and the whole convo was GONE. i feel scared that i may be INSANE. Why do I have to be like this. Why couldnt i be the other guy. Im fucking losing it. I want it to all end now. Its 11:38 as of typing this, and i genuily hope with a small DARK part of my heart that i dont wake up. Its fucking sickning to me. My stomac is in knots constsntly. I consider suicide everyday but i think if i get any lower i might DO IT. The only time im happy is when im asleep, i wish i could be asleep forever, maybe in a dream where im happy, were im with HER.

1c596w6;I'm tired of being mentally ill.;;I'm rotting away in my apartment again hoping to escape this through a person I'm trying to reach, risking a restraining order if I don't back off right now. As someone else just said. I will. But what else am I supposed to fill this void with. I'm so tired of being this way. Every single day I just know I'm mad. And everyone can tell. As soon as they get to know me. Why can't I just die. Why do I also have to be scared of death. I don't even want to get better anymore. I don't even know what I want anymore. I'm so I'll that I live in maladaptive daydreams. Looking back on how I view the world it's nonsense. My words are nonsense. Why was I even born. Why. I'm tired of being me. I'm tired. But death scares me. I don't want to do anything. I'm disgusted by my own existence. Damn it. Why did I have to survive my last attempt. All I had to do was to just lay still and not call the emergency in desperation. Then I would finally be at peace now. Ah you know. I might as well give my reason for reaching out to that person. They cursed me in a way. They reached out to me when I told them about my suicide attempt, looked me in the eyes and told me to never hurt myself. Now, whenever I think of suicide, I see and hear them. I hate them for it. Because now I can't die, and I miss them, even though I know it was just professional or whatever. Absolutely meaningless.

I am now thinking about making another plan but not really a plan. A friend's birthday is next month, (ironicaly my birthday is the day after) and i would give them something i owned. Long story short, we planned on doing a movie night but they were busy and i have the special collectiors edition that had a rare director's cut for about year now and i still never saw it because i wanted to wait and see it with them but they are unfortunitely always busy. If i give them that, it would show them that they mean a lot to me and that they were the only people who gave me any hope. It would be the perfect final gift before i end it all. They won't have to constantly deal with me asking them if we can hang out. I realize i only get in the way of people's lives with my bs sob stories.

1c585n2;I have nothing letting me stay alive;Calibeaches2;I just feel like I have absolutely nothing left. Anybody who would look at me would probably think that I live a really nice life, and it is truly a curse that how I feel on the inside doesn't remotely show on the outside. I feel like everything is pushing me towards suicide and I feel like no matter how much I ask for help we're advocate for myself that nobody truly hears me. I just don't have the voice of people want to listen to. I'm not the type of person that people will save before it's too late. I have tried everything I don't have friends, I don't know how to navigate the different resources to get true help. Even tonight I tried calling for the first time a domestic abuse hotline only for them to find out that I'm just a tenant and I live in an emotionally abusive household. Why can't I just find sustainable help? Why does it take so many steps and jumping through hoops just to find a safe place to sleep at night? People act as though tenants have all of these rights but when it really comes down to it they have to still advocate for themselves and if they're in a situation like mine, who is going to believe that it's too much? I'm hurting, I don't want to commit suicide but I cannot find help. All I have to do is buy some alcohol get drunk enough and I have enough pills to hopefully end it. How can I even have a possible chance If every single time I ask for help I just get ignored? Why should I have to sit here wondering how I can possibly feel safe in the depths of depression and completely overwhelmed? How did I end up being one of those people who are just another statistic just another grave site there's another sad story about suicide when in reality I have asked for help and so many ways but because I don't have a strong enough voice nobody hears me.;I just feel like I have absolutely nothing left.

My wife doesn't really gives a shit about me but she is an amazing mother to our boy. We remain married to take care of him, and she is a better person now than before.

1c57p7j;I’m tired to say the least;BlackandBlue718;So, without going into too much detail, life’s been a lot and I don’t think I can do it anymore, I’ve been contemplating about taking my own life. I’ve been thinking about it for a couple of months now and at first I was able to fend it off and distract myself from them, keep the thoughts at bay, but as time has gone on, they just keep getting worse and worse, the porn where I pretty much stay up till the early parts of the morning, sleep depriving myself so that it doesn’t come to happen. I don’t much care for myself and don’t see a bright nor good future ahead of me, really the only thing that’s stopping me, is my friends and family, or those that really care and have love for me. I keep thinking, “today might finally be it”, and I feel so close to doing it, but then I have memories and thoughts about everything and everyone, even those who aren’t even in my life anymore. I think about some of the great times we had and even the terrible ones, but because we were together during them, and I also think about how they would take it, my death I mean. And I know, some of them much harder than others, especially my father and best friend, I have a feeling it would truly kill them from the inside, and it’s just a shitty feeling. But I also think to myself, “fuck…what an amazing feeling to just not wake up again, to not care about anything or anyone again without any care or trouble”, it’s almost a soothing feeling and I will admit makes it even easier to go through with it. And even last year, it almost to it, but then I met someone. She was a good friend, and saved my life without even realizing it, and she helped so much. But things happened and afterwards, things got worse again and the feelings and thoughts came back, and with everything else in life and my depression seems like is getting worse and worse by the day. I have been in therapy for some time now, and it has been great, but deep down, it’s like…I don’t care anymore, I don’t care for myself nor do I care about anything in my future, because I don’t see one nor anything good coming from it. And I guess what I’m trying to say from all of this is that I’m afraid…if that makes any sense;So, without going into too much detail, life’s been a lot and I don’t think I can do it anymore, I’v;;0;3;2024-04-16 04:54:00;2024-04-16;Tuesday;04:54:00;2180;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:35.779873

1c57p3m;S.O.S. ;Potential-Historian6;If anyone takes the time to read this thank you. Never done anything like this but here it goes. Don't think this is really gonna help but im running out of options and maybe putting some of it in the endless void of the internet will give me some sense of peace even if just for a moment. Sorry in advance for the bad spelling and being all over the place. Not sure where to start. I turn 28 next week and my life is pretty terrible all because of bad decisions and some trauma both physical and mental. I went through alot when I was younger. I've had 4 open heart surgerys the last one when I just turned 21 and the timing of it all couldn't have been worse. Dropped out of college. The only girl I've ever loved broke up with me about a month before I got the news about my next surgery and she wanted to get back together the next day but I was young and stupid and did everything I could to convince myself that's not what I wanted and damn was I wrong. Whoever said better to have loved and lost than never have loved at all can go fuck themselves. I guess all anyone wants is to feel loved but I tried to convince myself otherwise and became so cold and isolated. I walked away from something so special..Didn't even have the spine to text her back.. I handled it so poorly...I really wanted to reach out not long after but never did because it just didn't seem right and for some reason lately all I can think about is how different my life would be if I was just honest with people who cared about me. Her brother in law was like my brother and always tried to reach out and i was to spineless to even reply half the time and when i did i was never honest. I just know I wouldn't have become the monster I am now. But I knew either she'd pull me out of this hell or I'd pull her in and I guess I made the right choice. Selfishly I wish I could go back but I can't. And fuck me it's consuming. But went through what I did all alone and it changed me. I've spent the better half of the last decade being nihilistic, drunk and lonely trying to fight fire with fire and boy did I get burned. I hate this felling..it's so consuming. From the outside looking in it'd be hard to tell.. Obviously goes without saying but im not bragging about any of this I'm talking about fucking killing myself to complete strangers on the internet for god sake...if anything it just proves how weak minded I've become..I'm lucky enough to have family and a few Friends that love me. I know how stupid and selfish it is but there are days i wish i didn't or i wouldn't even think twice about it. Im pretty tall, in good shape and supposedly good looking. Wouldn't say I'm rich but i have money and always will but let me assure those of you that think money would help it doesn't. What it does do is very bad things to good people and like Tony Stark said no amount of it has ever bought a second of time. I'd give every nickel I have and ever will for just a single minute of the past back. But nothing will ever change what I went through, what I did to her and how I handled it. I've tried everything to escape this feeling. I've talked to doctors. I've talked to family and friends. I've exercised 3 to 5 days a week for months now. I've tried doing things I used to enjoy but I just can't shake this. The only reason I haven't put a bullet in my head yet is because I know the pain it'll cause my Freinds and family especially my mom. But it's gotten so bad I just don't know what to do. I live in America and grew up around guns and hunting so that's how I'm gonna do it. I literally have a bullet with my name carved on it. 45 acp black tallon. I just don't wanna risk surviving and don't want to feel any pain or discomfort. I've experienced enough of that for 100 lifetimes. If there is a hell I'm certainly going for the things i have and will do but thats fine because I'm gonna find whatever it is that did this to me and its coming with me. But with my luck when i ask to see who or what it was the devil will just hand me a mirror because at the end of the day i was the one that did what i did. Not speaking to her again was so spineless regardless of what i thought about my health.. Goddammit I really am trying to look at the bright side even tried faith but it's hard to believe in a loving and caring God if you have suffered the way I have and saw the things I've seen. I was 12 during my 3rd surgery and experienced things in a children's ICU that no one ever should, let alone a kid. I saw kids die. I heard it. I smelled it. Saw parents get dragged out screaming the name of their dead child. I still feel it in my bones. Was never really honest with anyone about all that either. For some reason I just try to run away and bury my problems but the cup finally runneth over.I guess its the combination of alot of bad things but man does it suck. I'm fighting every day not to but i just don't know how much longer I can. God if I was just honest. If you made it this far I do appreciate it. If you've ever experienced this feeling please leave a reply it'd be nice to actually hear from someone who has experienced similar feelings. I know how hard it is to talk to people about it..the best I can do is make some post about it on the internet no ones probably even gonna read.Hope you find peace and happiness.;If anyone takes the time to read this thank you.

1c57m9o;My Thoughts As A 17y/old Male;missile_storm;"I have suicidal thoughts everyday and as of recent it has gotten worse. I’ve realized that I'm not sought out or wanted by anyone, not even my friend group. I’ve come to say this because my “friend group"" consists of me and 8 other people yet I'm never really invited to any of the hangouts or to go do things anywhere and they constantly make plans without even telling me or inviting me, and sometimes they talk about the plans in front of my face like I’m not even there and if I then ask what they are talking about they change it up and act like it was nothing. Two of them seem to care about me and say that they like me more than they like the others but I find it hard to believe them. It might just be the fact that I don’t believe them because I’ve been betrayed by people that I trusted and told my trauma to so many times in my life, but when they say it I just get this feeling that it isn’t true. The only time I’m invited anywhere is mostly when I’m needed to fill in a slot or for them to try to get me to help pay for things. They have a group chat that has everyone in it and one that has everyone but me in it’ which the second one is the one they talk in most of the time when they are trying to make plans for things. I’ve been used throughout most of my life by people and I’ve lost everyone that had either shown interest in me or had actually cared about me, and when I say lost I don’t mean it as if they moved or we grew apart. I mean it as in they either killed themselves or got murdered by people either in front of my eyes or at their home by a family member, and I’ve always blamed myself for not being strong enough to save them or help them so I got into lifting weights and got decently strong but then had gotten a sciatic nerve injury and hadn’t been able to do much and so as of now while I’m in my senior year of high school and I’ve lost the will to live and am on the edge of killing myself. Another thing that adds onto it is that I had met a girl a while back in July of last year and we hit it off and started dating. It was going well and we both had some things in common. We both liked the same music and acted pretty similar for the most part, and everyone who saw us said we were a good couple. She also had some trauma that she was worried to tell me at first cause she thought I was gonna leave her when I found out like how her ex’s did. Instead I just let her cry to me and had loved her even more because she trusted me enough to tell me everything she has been through. She later asked me to talk about my trauma to her so I did, which in turn had actually made us a lot closer and more comfortable together. After a while of it going good though we both got hit with some more trauma which had made her break up with me and in turn all of my past trauma came flooding back in and had hit me like a train. It has been months since then and I still can’t get over her. I tried looking for other people but none of them had been anywhere near as nice, passionate, and caring as she was. All of this brings me to where this weekend I had gone to my senior prom and had seen her and a mutual friend of ours that I hadn't talked to since the first semester because she went to online schooling. My ex had invited our friend because she really wanted to go but had to get invited by someone in order to be able to go. While at the prom that friend had come up to me and asked if this dude had liked my ex, which I had told her that he does but she doesn’t show any interest in him. My friend had responded to that by saying that she doesn’t show interest in guys to which I said that she had shown interest in me before we started dating. My friend had then responded to that by saying that yes she did but she now hates men, so I asked why which she had in turn said that it was because I was my ex’s first time of ever dating a male and that our relationship hadn’t ended well so she no longer likes men. That means that I had apparently been a horrible boyfriend to her or something so now I really just don’t know what to do with my life anymore. So at this point in time I'm really just debating on ending it all because all I ever do in life is mess up and bring pain to people around me. I really don't know what to do or why I should continue on living anymore.";I have suicidal thoughts everyday and as of recent it has gotten worse.

I somehow thought that i could turn left onto this road, it was a one way road, so i went head on with another vehicle. I dont know what to say or what words to use, but i dont understand why I am even here right now. Im embarrassed and ashamed and im extremely worried about the other car i hit. Im pretty sure this means any money i just made from my new job is now gone, plus i probably dont have a job anymore considering how bad this accident was. I should have ended myself weeks ago so none of this happened. I literally can't even think about what else to say, i keep getting myself in worse and worse positions. I don't understand. How did any of this happen why did i not see what the road was like? Why couldnt my gps just load properly... I dont understand. I always end up causing issues. Now how am i gunna pay for this ticket or rent or anything??? How am I supposed to be able to drive ever again? I just want to know how the lady is. I wish i was smarter.

First i was talking to him about how he definitely shouldn’t do anything stupid like that and i reminded him how God has a plan for him, but he said “i don’t need your words . this was just the last straw. i know the consequences.” That’s when i went onto reddit and seen i should let them talk to me so i did, he then told me how he’s thinking about taking his moms car and driving it till it has no gas and ending it on the side of the road, then he tells me “or hang myself with this belt. That’s what im thinking. But im too pussy” i ask him what else is on his mind and he tells me “nothing . I don’t wanna talk anymore. I can’t think straight and it’s hurting my head.

1c56y8e;I'm a FAILURE;desiCaesar;"This depression has brought my life to a complete halt. I had an accident last July and it has only aggrevated my premature depression into a full blown disorder. I may have valid reasons for being depressed. I have social anxiety which I want to get rid of but am unable to. I feel jealous looking at my friends socialising with many others as easily as a breeze. Let it be with juniors, our batchmates or seniors of my college, they've no problem. The moment I step out of my hostel room, I need no phone. I unconsciously start observing others and how ""different"" I am from them.Alas coming to academics, I was pumped up last year to study new coding skills (being a CS undergrad student) and work hard for this year's placements. But last summer had brought this depression. All of my friends are preparing well and applying for internships while I haven't even made my resume! 'Cause I have no hope or will to live for the future.Actually I am an introvert hence I hesitate to step out of the house unnecessarily. But when I starting going out of frequently insearch of training institutes as part of the summer break, I mad a couple of friends and also frequenting to theatres to watch all the ""feel-good"" cinemas. But this had hit me hard as a brick wall in giving me the realisation of how much I was different from others- like a social outcast.All this made me lose lustre of my life I have been rooting for death/suicide ever since. I don't rely on medications or therapy as I know they ain't gonna change my past. I just wanna sincerely apologise to my parents as being their only son, I've failed to bring them assurance and comfort in this unforgiving patriarchal Indian society.

1c56xjt;My biggest fear [vent];killla_whale;I’m 19m and I lost any semblance of normalcy a while ago. It’s been 2-3 years of hearing this siren call to end it all soon. I was in excruciatingly in love with someone who I got too comfortable with. I told her abt how I wanted to hurt myself and end it all and it was too much. She said she had demons and couldn’t keep me in her life. Just like that all I loved was gone. She was the reason I was sticking around honestly but I didn’t tell her. I may have come off as too uncaring and maybe I should’ve said something different but I never deserved it. I only know how to push away ppl. I’ve always been scared of being seen and friends just reminded me how undeserving I am of any of it.I know it’s unlikely but I want to find someone to be there when I end it. I’ve planned on staying at a motel for a night pretty soon and I’m ok with doing it solo but idk what I’m asking. I’m here because I don’t want to contribute to any of it anymore. I had dreams of moving to Europe and getting away from it all but it’s becoming clear to me that it’s becoming more and more infeasible. Sucks to be poor I guess. Sucks to be born with parents who stuck around together long enough for me to grow attached to the idea of a family, but not long enough to understand why they split. Sucks that my dad lives 1000 miles away and is an old perv. Sucks that my mom is stuck chasing worthless men. Sucks that my life could’ve been different but I chose to avoid confrontation and flee. That’s no way to live. I see no way I can continue and I don’t want toy either. It feels like I’ve taken the train as far as it goes already and I’ve missed a stop. I’m alone in a world of 8 billion people. I know I can make new friends and maybe love another but it’s not enough. That’s not why I want to end it, I need to because the hurt is compounding. It’s bleeding into my life, I’ve become a burden to my single mom, imagine that. She’s pregnant again so idk there’s a replacement I guess. My whole family tree is homophobic so of course it turns out I’m bi and my whole family thinks I’m a fag. I’m already dead to most of everyone so let’s make it official. Writing this out doesnt make me feel better. I hate what I’ve become and pretty soon I’ll be leaving.

1c56vqp;I messed up;False-Quarter-5417;my laziness finally caught up to me. I messed up my whole life from being lazy. I can no longer see a future. I think once tomorrow hits my family will find out how much of a disappointment I really am. That’s why I hope to do it tonight. I used to be the kid who got pretty good grades and my parents were happy for me. So they began to trust me. It got to the point where they wouldn’t ask me to show them my grades, and I even got a scholarship during high school where instead of taking high school classes I could take college classes at the university, so I did. I think this was my biggest mistake. I had never touched an ounce of homework I guess I always got lucky doing before class and teachers. So when I got the college classes that homework hurt so hard. I always prioritized my free time at home, and it started damaging my grades. Badly. I managed to pass 4/5 classes on the first semester. I failed English. It’s important to note that the year before I had gotten my first C and D, and no one noticed. No one told them about anything. I got lucky. I wished I hadn’t. I wished the school would’ve told them earlier and I had gotten caught without the repercussions being so bad. The second semester started and I don’t know why, I think I got cocky or something because I never showed up to any of my classes. I just didn’t want to go to school.  1-2 months ago my school called because I missed too many days of school and informed my parents that I had failed English Here I am on my second semester failing 6/6 classes. My brain did not process what it was doing at the time. They asked if I was failing the classes currently and I admitted and said yes. But it was like 2 or 3 weeks into the semester so I could recover. All they basically said was lock in. This same day they found that I was cutting myself all over my body. They didn’t know how to handle it and I don’t think they were in a position where we can afford  therapist or however that works. Nothing changed. They trusted me again. After breaking the trust , they gave it to me again and broke it again. I continued not to go to class. I guess I was embarrassed to go to a class I never showed up before. But then again I feeel like I’m just always making excuses, it’s toxic trait I have and the more I think about it, I’m not a good person. Everyone thinks I am but I’m not. I just want this feeling to go away. I wish I could just decide not to wake up one day because I’ve gotten so close to ending it but I never have enough force to push the knife into my heart, but now I have no excuse I’m backed up against a wall I put myself in. I basically have to retake junior year at the high school and my parents have to pay for all the classes I failed. I feel horrible, we don’t even have the money right now because my baby brother was just born. I hope he helps them grieve. And I did this for what. To TikTok doom scroll? Like seriously. I’m a horrible person. I’m about to cause so much pain to my family I do not want to see because it would break me too. I just can’t. My life doesn’t even seem real anymore. I have no memories of this school year. i think this has been set in stone for a while tho, i have indeed been rotting in room for the past year. Besides that though i lived a wonderful life with the best people i have ever and will ever meet, and had the best experiences. I think why im so content to die now, is because i did complete my life goal which was go to Japan. I also got baptized recently hopefully it helps them since they’re religious. Overall I had a fantastic and great life. It’s just disappointing it has to end early but I’m okay with that now, because it was me who ruined the  life given to me.;my laziness finally caught up to me.

1c56kbc;I will kill myself next year.;forevernap365;Hi. I really don't know why I'm deciding to post this. I've decided that if I'm not happy/content by January 1st of 2025, I'm killing myself. I don't want to get into details in the very off chance any of my family members read this, but I am so excruciatingly miserable. I know there are plenty of amazing reasons to keep living, but I don't think they're good enough for me. The negative parts of life outweigh the good parts and I don't think I can handle the pain anymore. I want to get help, but my situation is so difficult. I feel like I'm screaming into the void while chained to a wall. I'm giving it one year. I hope it doesn't come to it, but I just can't. I'm going to try my best to get better, but it's been a long long time with these feelings and I can't handle life for much longer. I'm writing a journal for my family to read if I go through with it. My death date will be March 3, 2025 since it won't interfere with any major holidays or birthdays in my family.

1c564p4;1 month left to live;stardewzazaman;In a month I'm going to be homeless. I have nowhere to go, nobody wants me. I have handful of friends who will be able to have me every once and a while but it won't be enough. I don't have a job, I can't bring myself to work anymore. I don't know if I'm just lazy, or too depressed, or somethings wrong physically idk. Work drains tf out of me, school is already draining me alone. I can't do both. It looks almost impossible to graduate, but I can't drop out either. If I drop out I'll never get out of poverty and I'll end up like this again anyway. I have to do an internship this summer as part of my degree requirements, but I can't hold a job on top of it and it doesn't pay nearly enough to live, so I'm stuck. I can't go back to my mom's, I can't fathom telling her I'm trans or admit my life is in shambles, and that she's right that I'm a disappointment. I can't burden anybody with letting me stay the whole summer with them. I can't afford an apartment. I'm scared to live in my car bc it's getting old and I'm scared something will happen to it. I'm in credit card debt. I'm sad. I'm always sad. I'm always numb or crying or angry. The last few weeks I feel like my body's been preemptively shutting down like it knows what I'm going to do, I'm slowing down. I can't eat without feeling ill, I can't sleep anymore or I sleep too much, I'm exhausted, my head always hurts, my body always hurts. Just walking to class is exhausting. I'm tired and I don't care anymore, even if all my problems could be solved I still want to go. I'm not happy. I haven't been happy in a very long time. I've been using this mood tracker for 4 years now, and I was looking thru all the data. Every year the amount of good and happy days go down significantly, and the bad and numb days go up to make up for it. I don't even think I have the ability to feel happy anymore. Even when I'm with my friends, everybody's having a good time and I'm distracted from it all feeling like I don't have a single problem in the world, I still feel empty. It gnaws at me.;In a month I'm going to be homeless. I have nowhere to go, nobody wants me.

I feel like dying because I truly liked him and wanted to be with him and he dumped me over nothing. I keep blaming myself.;iLuvChipotle222;I'm really struggling after a complicated situation with a guy I met on Tinder. We clicked instantly, sharing many interests and values, and after a few dates, things progressed quickly. However, we soon encountered trust issues. He went through my phone without permission, misinterpreted what he saw, and accused me of talking to other guys. Despite my efforts to clarify things, he didn't believe me and broke things off. In a moment of desperation, I even reached out to his mom (who doesn't even know me), which I regret. We tried to reconcile, but he expressed that he found me too needy and co-dependent, and ultimately, he ended things, citing his own personal issues and the need for space. I was deeply invested in this relationship, especially since I lost my virginity to him. This was all in a span of one month, and I truly liked him and wanted to be with him for the long term. I'm strongly mourning what could've been. I feel like this is all my fault. I just want to call him and text him to work things out, but I know it would do more harm than good if I did that right now. Now, I'm left wondering if I should hold onto hope that he might return, or if it's even wise to consider giving us another shot, considering how things ended. What should I do to improve my chances of getting back together, or should I let go?I've been in tears all day and very suicidal.

I don't feel like I can tell my mother since I don't actively have a plan to kill myself and I just know that I'll die within the next year, I don't know the exact date. So, sending me to a psych ward isn't going to help. I feel like someone's going to kill me and it's somehow okay.

I love my son so much and i hate that i feel like i do wanna commit suicide because i know he'll miss me. I left his dad 3 weeks ago, i have no job no car and living back with my mom. I literally am so useless. ive been applying everywhere and not hearing anything back from anywhere and i cant help but shake the thought of how usless i am and its literally all i think of myself everyday. and ever since we came back to my moms my son has had trouble getting used to here so i have to try my hardest every day and night when its time for bed or his naps to get him to actually want to lay down with me and watch tv, he goes with his dad on weekends and he always tell me how easy it was for him to get him to bed or how he doesnt throw tantrums with him. And with me its the opposite i love my son so much im with him everyday and i try my absolute hardest ti keep him happy everyday and every chance i get, but i dont get the side of him that his dad gets and i feel like now im just not good enough for my son either, that im failing him somehow or im not keeping him as happy as his dad can, and this just makes me feel even worse this adds onto my feeling of not being good enough for anyone and being so useless. I was contemplating commiting suicide this Saturday when he goes to his dads. But seeing him now up and smiling at me makes me realize i cant leave him behind. But oh how bad do i want to die.

Does anyone have tips for social functions? Im autistic to my knowledge (undiagnosed but my counselor and phych both said the only reason they dont flat out say i am is cause i need a test for official diagnosis) and i find maintaining even basic and shallow social function to be met with failure. The most i can do is classroom aquantinces on good terms and maintain it. I cant even properly comprehend what friend even means and things similar to it no matter how hard i try do to the unpredictability and implications that each and every person puts into their version of the word and im tired of not getting it. Despite being a human, a species biologically known for its reliance on social relations, i fail at such a base physiological need. I tried even maintaining a surface level social function with a small streamer and their community, but ended up being banned cause “it would be better for their mental”. Mind you they were very nice and aconedating as i was upfront with my social ineptness, i was just failing so hard and unable to notice things that would have told others how to modify behavior. They even ended up directly telling me sometimes and i was both very sorry for the mental strain i was causing and appreciative of the feedback, but in the end i still failed. In the end i always fail. No matter how many changes i make, its never right. It never works. I restructure and restructure continuously through my life to try and get it right and i fail and fail and faik and fail and fail and fail again and again, over and over. And im just so tired, so alone, with no hope of improving meaningfully at this rate. I just wish i had a normal brain. Even if i kept my fucked up life that i dont even want to get into here, if i had a normal brain, i could atleast get the basics and work from there. But i dont, so i wont, and it seems like ill never be able to fix this issue.

I’ve been living with my single mother for years, and we have never gotten along. She’s always told me it was on me, since I’ve been manipulative since I was about eight years old and I’ve been antagonizing her since then, according to her. I have always found this confusing, since I don’t remember ever making the conscious decision to do that to her, but maybe I did. I resorted to trying to be academically great to satisfy her, since she just believes Im a bad person, and it’s worked for the most part, she gets off my back, but then she’ll have a moment every week where she reminds me the only thing in good for is school. I believe her now, I don’t see what else I have to offer anyone really. I’ve been told I’m pretty and according to all my professors I show promise, but beauty fades and what good is intelligence or promise if you are bound to be alone forever? Our fights can get pretty ugly, we both say things that are hurtful, she’ll apologize the next week and buy me things to make up for it. Then, the next time we argue, she’ll throw it in my face that she’s always taken care of me and bought me things and I’m ungrateful. She tried to choke me once and almost did, that’s the only time I’ve ever been scared of her. She thinks I don’t care about her or anything in my life, that I’m this nonchalant person, but that’s only because I don’t have the energy to argue with her anymore. I care about her opinions too much, if she thinks I’m a disappointment at any point, it’ll send me into a spiral, and I’ll do anything to get in her good graces. She’s always been very judgemental on others looks so I developed a bad ED when I was 14-16, hoping she’d notice I was making an effort, that almost got me hospitalized. I take everything she does to heart because she’s kind to everyone else in her workplace or the family. I know she can be good to me as well because we have good moments, which makes me feel guilty for making her out to be such a monster but, the entire thing is just a big blob of mental turmoil I’ve been living in for 18 years. It feels pathetic and I feel stuck in this loop where I want her approval and I hate myself for wanting it, then I realize there is probably a lot of truth to what she says when she’s angry and I won’t want to get do anything for days. This leads to me thinking about suicide for extended periods of time . Usually, these episodes will take place for a week at most and then I’ll manage to lift my spirits. However, recently I noticed that no matter how much time goes by, I always come back to this thought. I don’t see how to fix it, and I find this slightly annoying and even pathetic as I don’t think anything is horribly wrong with my life. Other people have it worse, my mom says there’s moms out there that have beaten and killed their children, I know this is true as well, I just feel stuck. I have a completely debilitating sense of dread for the future and my ability to live on for 50 more years or however long it takes for me to go, life seems to lack so much of the luster it had when I was a kid. I don’t even know if I want to keep trying to go on for that many years if I’m never gonna get rid of this feeling or have anyone that I can feel lighter around. Hopefully in the next year or two I can muster up the courage to go through with it, I’m thinking of an overdose, but I want to do it before I turn 21, I don’t want to go on that long. I guess I just want someone to tell me how to look at this in a more positive light, right now I don’t see the way, maybe there is one.;I (f18) have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was about 14 years old.

1c52w4n;I hate the fact that I cannot kill myself;AnonymousIncognito__;I have tried to kill myself multiple times. Been suicidal since I was 7. I have bipolar disorder 2, and I know getting medication is gonna be someone’s response. I have been medicated for 7 years and I got back to college lost my mind and got on pills again then rediagnosed with mood disorder to bipolar 2. i stopped taking pills after 3 months and was fine, and then I just dealt. The last time I attempted I tried to hang myself and couldn’t. Tried dying from slicing my wrists and bleed out but it didn’t work. I have work in the morning and I just literally have completely lost it. I have nothing to keep me here. I won’t qualify for assisted suicide in Canada because the bill hasn’t been passed yet and because there I don’t have treatment. I was raped, in over 15k in debt, have no place to live after the semester is over, my animal is sick, I am sick, I have to get surgery soon, I have too much stress, failing college, have absolutely no money, have no energy, and just literally no room to live. I cannot end up in a psych ward because then I would just want to kill myself even more. Which is why I never told my therapist. I don’t believe in therapy because my therapist abandoned me after 7 years because I was “too much”, fully knowing I have abandonment issues. Sometimes I wish my abusive ex literally just killed me, because he still haunts me to this day trauma bond is real. I have had a gun to my head so many times by him. I just literally do not want to live. I just wanna close my eyes, go to sleep and never wake up. I can’t though, because each time I attempt I fail. I have too much going on, my mind is against my body and vise versa. Last time I tried to overdosed nothing happened I just ended up with liver damage. I can’t legally own a gun because 1 I have my med card and 2 I am mentally ill. I try so hard to smile through the pain and go through life. I look at these news reports of people who kill themselves, and just go wow. I wish that were me. I wish I was successful. I am trying to strangle myself but I know it is stupid because my natural instinct will take over like the time I tried to hang myself. I have friends, but in reality I really don’t have anyone. I have my biological family and adoptive family to try to balance and its just annoying. I pray everyday I get hit with a car, get into a bad accident I just die. i physically cannot kill myself because if I fail I will be a vegetable or literally end up brain dead and then stuck living a worse life. accepting this life isn't an option. i wish there was a button I could press to self destruct. i am just done. why is it so hard to kill myself. my purpose has already achieved, nothong worth living for.;I have tried to kill myself multiple times.

1c52rwn;A bad subliminal made me almost kill myself (subliminal users please help, but ofc anyone can respond);Mean-Ball-8758;Hello, so idk my story may be a little different from like a normal suicidal thing. Not in the way of like “oh im better my storys worse”. No, in fact i think my story is plenty stupid to most people. I listened to a negative subliminal, and i wished a multitude of things. I wished to be pretty, i wished to be smarter, i wished for me and the people i cared about to die of old age and no longer be suicidal and start to heal. And not only that i wished specific stuff on ways to heal that were specific to them because i hated seeing everyone around me suffer. Well, turned out, this was an opposite subliminal!!! The opposite of what i wanted to happen, happened! And i wished so many things that realizing this and watching these bad results come to fruition has made me go literally insane!! So of course i did what most subliminal users do and listened to a flush, but it removed a lot of results i wanted- so i listened to a permanent results subliminal which brought back old desired results. Wellll i have intrusive thoughts and my fear of getting those results back caused them to not only come back permanently but to loop repeatedly in my mind as the subliminal stated. Now whether or not it truly did loop in my mind doesnt matter, it matters that i believed that it did and my belief in the negativity was so strong that things just got worse from there. My friends problems got so much worse, and i became hated by so many people. My grades slipped fo almost failing, and i became stupid and worst of all my best friend almost committed suicide. I have since been flushing this subliminal and doing desired results subliminals but im always living my life in fearI constantly felt like i had to die to save everyone and that i had no choices, and i still feel like it will never go away. Im sorry ive said way too much but you know its how ive felt for the entire year. I feel so out of control and i have almost committed suicide myself many times. It doesnt help that i feel like nobody cares because everyone hates me and im all alone sooo idk im sorry lol.any advice or support anyone can offer would be really appreciated;Hello, so idk my story may be a little different from like a normal suicidal thing.

1c52mev;HELP!!! I dont know what to do anymore ;Ok-Pianist-9729;I am a female who is 19. I feel so out of options. I've tried every stimulant and currently I'm on adderall and it doesn't work at all. I feel tired and weak and get angry quickly. I start shaking and feel nauseous. Adderall used to work when I was younger. It doesn't anymore.In general without medication I feel so hungry and tired all the time. With medication it makes it worse.  I can't get regular sleep without continuously waking up everyday. I've been feeling so hungry over the past few years. When i complain they test me and my labs come back normal so they just shrug. I'm sorry tried of living. Everyday is so miserable. Without my meds I lose everything, get mad, I can't function, I can barely take care of myself. With my meds I feel sick and miserable too.  I am on duloxetine because it's the only med that doesn't apparently cause weight gain. It kind of works. I gained a bunch of weight after starting the depo shot a few years ago because my cramps were debilitating and i would throw up and be unable to walk, and my period is very heavy so i tried to opt out of that experience. 50 pounds later i hate myself so much and i still feel so hungry every day. I have switched to using patches continuously to skip my period but the best part is when i take my adderall i start BREAKTHROUGH BLEEDING and severely cramping. how am i supposed to win???? Then the stupid ass doctors just tell me to take ibuprofen, which i can't because it doesn't work as well anymore, and it interacts with duloxetine and Tylenol is just about as useful as my PINKY TOE. I've tried so many diets, calorie counting, drinking water, i wake up in the middle of the night hungry. I could eat until I'm so full i can't move but i would STILL BE HUNGRY. Doctors don't know what's wrong with me and don't know why my adderall doesn't work. My A1C and glucose is perfect.It's gotten to the point where I pretty regularly cry about being hungry no matter how little or how much i eat, and I'm even STARVING ON ADDERALL.I have been trying so many different doses of fucking every stimulant And i would literally go home from school and work crying and i have been crying in the bathrooms lately. I want my body back and my life and my money i spend it all on food and I struggle in school and work and i just want to function like a normal person.I get angry doing school work and cry daily so I have just not been showing up, and I have been calling out of work too. I DONT KNOW HOW TO GET A DOCTOR TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!!! please help please help I'm so MISERABLE.  I don't know how to fix myself and be my former self again. I wish i never FUCKING TOOK THE FIRST FUXKING SHOT. I'm literally in tears as I'm reading this right now and yes i SO FUCKING HUNGRY. And no, i cannot afford therapy.In conclusion, I cannot function or sleep or study or work and i am constantly hungry and i have ran out of options. I even tried to hypnotize myself.

1c52m5l;I told my friend I wouldn't live to 30;happyplatypus_16;Hi,Tonight I told my friend I consider like a sister that I wouldn't live till 30.It's not that I want to die but may be suffering from DID (dissociative personality disorder).I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but the diagnosis may evolve cause apparently we misunderstood my symptoms. I know there is really little chance I have not DID.One of my alter already tried to kill our body in the past so I know that I won't have enough control to prevent him to kill our body.I just don't want him to hurt anyone else. I find the situation really ironic cause it's the first time in my life I don't want to die all the time. I realize that I want to have the power to decide when it will happen. In my country, there's some people that can access medical suicide and I will try to have that. I know that it's a really difficult journey I'm starting but I will do it. Medically or not. I don't want to live my life in an hospital or at the asylum. I'm scared as hell but i feel peace thinking about that idea. That makes me think it's the good decision. It won't happen until a few years so I'll try my best to enjoy life till then. My sister was really hurt but understood and told me she'll be there. I know I'm not alone. I know I'm loved. I know I will have to die at one point.

1c527j3;The guy at the suicide line helped me, i want to thank him now;Emotional-Drive-6960;"So this happened a few years back in around 2018-2019.

But then, i suddenly couldn’t, i stopped myself and i burst into tears. Sitting in the same room right now and it just feels like i made the right choice. In the morning when i woke up i decided to call the suicide hotline in the US via skype, because back then i didn’t have a hotline in my home country of Pakistan. I talked with him and he made me laugh and giggle a little, i was still a little childish back then. He asked me if i had any dreams and i told them to him while my eyes were puffed up, red, and filled with tears because i hadn’t felt that much valued in a long time. I told him about my dreams and he told me and i quote “Hey, if you really want to achieve your dreams and your goals then you really shouldn’t do it. Hey, one day in the near future you might be able to achieve your goals but ending it now would mean you’d lose out on it” and it just made me cry and think about it for a second, it made me feel so much better, i can not explain how thankful i am to that guy.

1c523cv;Had a mental breakdown and I am scared I will kms;unfunnypieceoftrash;Had a mental breakdown today and I’m scared I will eventually kmsSince January, my mental health has steadily declined, after experiencing loss of my grandpa and seeing his corpse, doing stressful internship for a month, last year, experiencing earthquake at the start of the year, I started having extreme health anxiety and physical symptoms, going to multiple doctors and ERs, having no friends except for my long distance boyfriend, meeting him for the first time in February then having to leave him at the airport which further traumatized me. Then leaving my moms house for the first time and moving to a new place triggered anxiety and stress like I’ve never experienced before, I started getting weak muscles, dry mouth, skin and eyes, insomnia. I have started my first adult job in April, working nine to six, and only realizing they will be making me work night shifts and day shifts alternating and with long hours. Which made me realized I made a mistake and I don’t want to work for this company in this position. Ever since moving and starting this job I would start crying almost every day, feeling nauseous, my skin and mouth feel dry and I get headaches. Yesterday when I realized that I can’t handle working at this company and that I made a big mistake agreeing to work here, I thought of how stupid and worthless I was and I started crying unconditionally in public, tears streaming down my face as I walked home, feeling like there were weights on my legs. I wanted to collapse to the ground right then and there. When I got home I had a mental breakdown, thought I was going to kill myself, I felt so scared and felt so unsafe. I started screaming and beating my fists against the wall until my hand hurt. I called in sick today for work and they are planning on making me move for work on the 18th to a different location and stay at a hotel to do some kind of speech in front of an audience. I don’t think I am in the physical or mental state to do so. But my family tells me to not quit and stick out the first three months but I do not feel safe anymore and everyday I am distracted by my physical symptoms, I feel so lost as to what to do, if I quit this job I will have nothing to show for, I will be unemployed for life. I feel so stuck and hopeless. For years I haven’t gone to a therapist or taken medicine to alleviate my issues. I was fine to an extent last year. I guess all my stress compounded and is now trying to destroy me.

There is no reason to know me.You admitted it. I know you like thinking you're better than me. And you are. I have nothing exceptional to show for myself. I'm nothing and all I do is joke about it. The only things I could even be considered decent at aren't even useful. Other kids at my school think I'm a freak. They aint wrong but ykkk... Im difficult, spoiled, and whine and cry at every itty bitty inconvenience. Probably gonna bash my head on a hard surface again later. I'm gonna be honest kitten, daddy's about to fucking lose it.

1c51t5g;Apr 15th 2024;mentlhealth;"Ughh I hated today so much. Yesterday I worked from 11 pm to 4 am on writing the script for the video with like 2 30 min breaks which I used to play ff7. When I woke up this morning I was insanely tired because I had to go to school at 8 am but I just went ahead and got my mom to take me to school. In school all I did was draw and read some pages of ""Norwegian Wood"". It was pretty uneventful up until the 3rd class, in my 3rd class a girl fainted and we had to leave the class room and because after the 3rd class we have a 30 min lunch break most of the students from my class went ahead to go get lunch. I saw a group of around 10 kids who make fun of me go down the stairs and heard them laughing because the girl had fainted which sort of solidified the idea in my mind that I wasn't crazy and most of my classmates were genuinely horrible people. Even though my 3rd class was canceled because of the fainting incident I still decided to wait until the bell rang to go get some food. I usually don't eat on my lunch breaks because I use the money which my parents give me for other things such as; books, games or even hanging out with my friends, but this time I had decided to just get some food as I was feeling particularly hungry. I ate a pizza slice and a donut and sat on a short knee high concrete wall which was in the yard of my school as I read a bit of my book. I then headed to class and as soon as I knew it my classes had ended and I had to go home. While I was in school I had a very silly thought in which I sort of compared myself to Sisyphus. I did this because I realized thaf my life had become a constant cycle of waking up tired, going to school, writing things down in school, wishing I qas home, getting home and then writing at home till 2 am each night. This realization made me sad but I decided that I had to have this sort of a monotonous life as the end result would be a video of which I would truly be proud. I got home and talked with my sister for a bit before laying in bed and scrolling instagram. This however was a mistake as I fell asleep and lost about 2 and a half hours of my day. Ultimately this wouldn't have really mattered anyway as I ended up not doing any work today. Me not being productive genuinely made me take a hit to my mental health as one of the only things which is still keeping me going is the feeling I get when I'm actually productive. At like 12 am my mom kept coming into my room and arguing with me about going to sleep so I promptly kept trying to convince her to let me stay. This seemed to work as she left my room, but alas she came back around 30 minutes later and this time told me that tomorrow she would have both my internet and the houses internet turned off so that I can't use my pc. I of course had to argue with her at 12:30 but she was being childish so I decided to just leave her alone as I realized she wouldn't listen to me no matter how hard I tried. My mom has always sort of acted like a toddler, not really listening to reason or admiting that shes wrong, she constantly lies but absolutely hates it when I use the word ""lie"" for her this word is on the same level as saying a swear word infront of her or something. Of course her childish behavior has made me lose any respect I ever had for her which makes her really mad. I find it funny that my mom never takes accountability for mentally abusing me and then she keeps pestering me to do things like clean my room or study when I'm not able to do that because of this great hole of depression which I reside in. Sometimes she'll decide that she wants to try being a good parent and ask me whats wrong but whenever that happens I of course always tell her that it's all alright and that I'm doing well when I clearly am not. This is because everytime I've told her about a serious issue I have in my life (i.e me having suicidal thoughts or me getting bullied in school) she always seems to understand and be genuinely sorry for what I've gone through but later down the line she uses these things against me. For instance we were having an argument once and she told me somthing along the lines ""what? You want to kill yourself? Well then go ahead and do it"". This happpens quite often and I get very depressed when it does, that's why I've decided to stop talking to her about my problems. This has also made me unable to truly vent to a person, so much so that I have to use a burner on reddit to post what are essentially diary entries for the whole world to see just because I think a account without anything linkekd to it is safer than actually talking to one of my friends or something. But in my defense I recently had a friend tell me something that genuinely crushed my soul. So much so that I stopped talking and moving for 10 minutes after he siad it and just sat there crying my eyes out in a hysterical manner. This happened through discord so I promptly muted myself so they couldn't hear my weeping and so they had no idea what was going on. This also happened infront of my crush which made things even worse as she sort of kinda agreed with what he said. Now let me explain what happened. Me, my crush and 2 other friends were in a discord call together as usual. Me and my crush were talking and she said that I'm literally like some character from a video game ( i can't remember which character cause I sort of disassociated after what happened). I proptly said that this character in fact wasn't like me but instead that I thought that another character was more simillar to me. (Now I won't specify which character but at least I'll mention that he's froma book. I also want to mention that this character isn't really a good one as he has a lot of sexual thoughts, is very depressed and sometimes misogynistic. Now let me get this clear I don't relate to the misogyny part as this aspect of him is only present when he is in a way more horrible mental state than anyone could ever imagine and while I might not relate to the misogyny in every other aspect he is exactly like me. Same thoughts, same speech patterns, same level of depression, same everything basically.) I want to mention that at the time and still to this day I have never fully opened up to someone, not my crush, not my friends and definitely not my parents, so basically nobody knows the real me; What I think about, how I act, how my life is going and how my relationship with my pparents is, are all aspects of me which not a single person on this world (except for myself and you who are reading this) knows about. When I mentioned this character she replied in a sort of disgust ""Well that might not be the best person to compare yourself to"" this is because she doesn't like the character for who he is, this is fine but she hasn't even read the entire book so she doesn't know about the development this character experiences. I would've liked to reply with ""Well not you nor anyone here knows how I think so I'm not sure if judging me like that is alright but ok"" but I didn't say this as I didn't want her perception of me to change from someone who is a bit silly to someone who hides who they really are from others. In this moment my friend who I'll call Jhon asked us who the character that I was comparing myself to was since he had heard me and my crush talking about this book on numerous occasions. He decided to google it and after reading what the book was about he said ""So this is who you've been pretending as to and looking up at your entire life?"" That sentence was one of the most soul crushing sentences I've heard in my entire life. After he said this my crush said ""Jesus man you didn't have to say it like that"" in a sort of neutral tone which in my mind represents that everyone around me was thinking the exact same thing. I went silent and proceeded to mute my microphone and weep profusely at what was just said. Now I understand that you might not really get why I would cry at this and its very simple, this whole thing was spoken in a different language and so I've tried to translate it as close as I can but there just really isn't a correct way to say it with 100% accuracy. Now this made me sad because with that sentence he made me belive that basically all of my emotions and everything I went through in my entire life was all just a farce. The things which I belived made me a sad and somber man with no will to live was juust me overreacting and being overly emotional. This sentence made me think that everyone thought of me this way, as some guy who was trying to act sad but truly wasn't. I had realized at that moment that truly nobody in the whole world knew what I went through, rhey didn't know about the heart breaks, the pain, the emotional and mental scars which I had aquired throughout my life. They didn't know about any of it and though I was just someone who acted sad because he though it was cool but in reality was genuinely happy. This of course isn't the truth and is a memory which continues to haunt my soul and I think about it almost every time I talk to any of my friends. I'm sorry for writing this late but I didn't think I would have anything to write about today until me and .my mom had an argument. Yesterday I reposted my original post about my life and mental state but not a single soul saw it, and so I've decided to post this one as well.  Maybe this one will be seen and I'll finally get some help and confort for what I've gone through.";Ughh I hated today so much.

I hate myself as it is everything from my teeth to my toenails it genuinely makes me feel sick if I see myself in a mirror, thing is I workout a LOT because it's the only place I can go to get away from it besides work I'm not fat have abs decent arms but it all makes me sick.Anyway I'll be gone soon anyway if not self inflicted probably due to something like sepsis from a tooth that I genuinely just don't have time to get dealt with I work throgh the day 7 days a week, go to the gym at night and every other second is spent dealing with some issue that happened to come up out of nowhere involving one of those people. I don't know the point of this post not like anyone can actually do anything besides tell me to get away, like I haven't tried but I genuinely can't say no to those kids.Oh and if you are wondering why this is posted in here I have everything planned for the 1st of next month, what I'm going to do, the time,place, will is written everything is set up.

1c50pwt;Spiralling Forever;inspektorkemp;"I feel like I know too much. The economy is crumbling and capitalism is devouring itself. I got fired from my shitty capitalist job in my shitty capitalist city because I couldn't keep my mouth shut about how terribly I was being treated. In between scrambling to find a replacement job and the unchecked terror of potentially being forced back into retail, I'm grappling with my PTSD in ways I never have before. My life has been a constant cycle of naive innocence and bubbly confidence, and crash-and-burn arcs where I feel like everything falls apart around me and nothing I do matters. I was hit by my father as a child at the age of four or five. Once. Once was all it took. One strike on the backside at so tender and fragile an age was all it took to destroy something crucial inside me forever. I live in constant terror of authority figures. I walk on eggshells around everyone I interact with, to appease them and not provoke their ire - yet the other side of me wants to stand up for herself, to bite back when bitten, to lash out when struck. She isn't going to let anyone hurt her again. But unfortunately, being an adult in this awful, awful world means letting lots of people hurt you, spit on you, throw you under the bus, and to smile and take it like a good little servant. I see the snideness, the condescending attitudes of those above me, those who wouldn't piss on me if I were on fire, those who think giving employees pizza parties and snack food makes up for their terrible management and unfair labor divisions. When I detect disrespect, I become crippled and paralyzed. I cannot decide if I need to scream at them or start crying and apologize. Neither are socially acceptable. Even a professional apology does nothing, because one social infraction at work is all it takes to get the ball rolling. They've singled you out. They know you're too smart to buy their bullshit, and that makes you a threat. Adulthood is an endless parade of convincing people far more powerful than you'll ever be that they don't have to be afraid of you. As if you could ever lay a finger on them whatsoever. Adulthood is kissing ass to people who would happily put a knife in your throat if you annoy them too much. I can't deal with it anymore. I never wanted to be an adult. I never wanted to exist in the first place. Being born was a violation of my consent. I wish I were never brought screaming from the unconscious void into a bright, loud, confusing world where everyone is mad at me and yelling at me and telling me how to dress, how to walk, how to talk, how to feel, how to exist. My life has never been my own. I suppose no one's is, but that just makes me angrier. I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself just to spite these stupid fucking assholes who couldn't see how much I was hurting, who couldn't stop my basketcase of a father from hurting me, who wouldn't stop the bullies at school who could smell how weak and pathetic I was. I want to hack my veins open and bleed out all over their porcelain, perfect world, to drag them all through the mud so they finally understand that the fantasy land they defend is one that took a sweet, innocent, beautiful little girl who just wanted to love and be loved and broke her down into a maddened mess of sadness, isolation, and hatred. I used to be bright and sweet. I am now dim and bitter. I am angry. I am hateful. I am a screaming infant with a chainsaw, torn between hacking apart the fabric of reality that lies before me, and turning it on myself so that I can shut my eyes and feel the pain finally go away. Pathological demand avoidance. ADHD. 'Highly sensitive person.' Autism. Oppositional defiance. Rejection sensitive dysphoria. CPTSD. They're all insufficient terms conjured up by a system that rewards moneymaking instead of helping people heal. I have attempted twice in my life. I know damn well how useless emergency services are. How they and the friends that call them smile to your face and tell you everything is going to be okay, but secretly want to hit you and scream at you and ask what the fuck is wrong with you, stop being a freak and get back in line with everyone else. Nobody else complains like you, so maybe you're the problem. Nobody else runs away from home intending to cut themselves open and bleed out in a ditch on the side of the road on a cold October night, feeling so utterly alone and rejected and hated because your stupid fucking 'therapist' can't help you because your anxieties are bigger than ""I'm stressed about school,"" because anyone read as masculine by this system is seen as a threat to others first and foremost. I remember how that awful young lady talked to me, like I was a potential school shooter. It made me feel like scum. Like I was a disease. Like I needed to annihilate every trace of myself, like when she told me 'your friends aren't therapists,' that it was indication I was the problem. Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I don't care anymore. Maybe I'm sick of trying to have my pain be understood that I want to die just so that everything will stop. I entered this world very, very frightened, and have only grown more scared with each passing say. I'm a young adult now. The fucked up part is that my life isn't truly that bad. I've got stable housing for now, though I might have to move in with my abuser again thanks to getting fired if nothing else comes through. I have a master's degree, but it's in a dying industry that AI is tearing to pieces. I can write. I can make art. I can act. I can sing. I can do all these things that I once loved and maybe still do, but none of the social skills needed to make it anywhere in a cutthroat world. My inner child wants to scream and cry at being made to try. People tell me I have to try. Maybe I don't want to try. Maybe I don't want to live. It should be my right to choose, shouldn't it?Telling me I have no choice makes me want to swan dive off the nearest parking garage right here and now. I know it won't fix anything. I know inevitably I'd fail and be forced onto some drugs that might actually make me want to smile again for a year or so before I'd inevitably get another job where I'll accidentally piss off another insane boss because I didn't smile wide enough at their small talk and I'll be right back where I started. I was set up to fail from the jump. I have a car, a home, a girlfriend, hobbies, friends, education, memories, skills and qualifications. But...But none of that matters under capitalism. Sorry.I'll smile at the customers wider next time, I'll kiss the interviewer's ass more next time, I'll be more submissive and agreeable, I won't cry, I won't say anything the next time a supervisor puts hands on me. I'm an abuse magnet. Everywhere I go, people see a victim. And they're right. Capitalism breeds victims and I'm a prime model. Sorry. Sorry for existing. Sorry. I'm so sorry I made you upset.I don't want to do this anymore, man. I want to run into the desert and let the elements take me. I want to go back to the bathroom where it happened and self-immolate while singing my favorite songs until I die. I want to bleed out in a field of beautiful flowers, so that something gorgeous might grow from the demise of so pathetic and sad a life. I want to sink to the bottom of the ocean and let corals and starfish grow upon my sunken bones. I want the atoms of my body that once belonged to stars to drift off into the aether and become part of something great. If I cannot have a beautiful life, perhaps I might have a beautiful death. I'm scared. I want my mom. I want to go home. I can't do this anymore. I'm a prisoner in this torture chamber, and it's never going to stop until Death takes me. I haven't the strength to destroy me myself, so I'll keep trudging on day by day until something finally breaks me. I want to go home to my old bedroom with the dinosaurs on the walls I painted with my sisters and my grandmother before my childhood cat knocked paint over everywhere and tracked it across half the house before we caught him, curl up in my racecar bed with all my stuffed animals - the teddy bear, the pink unicorn, the Pokemon plushies, everyone - and close my eyes and let it all just disappear.

I need to atone for how evil I am by being executed by the state.My autism makes it very hard to function in my day to day life.  I'm in college rn and it's just extremely hard to function like a normal human being.  My dorm room is a fucking mess and the floor is covered with trash and it got so bad there's fucking mice.  Imagine ""rotmaxxing"" on tiktok but literally.  I don't have a roommate but it's still super awful.  I've missed so much class and although my grades are decent I'm still struggling a ton.  I go days without showering or even washing my face or changing my fucking clothes, and I only eat like 600 calories a day.  None of this is by choice, but the structure of living in a dorm vs an apartment or whatever is super super fucking difficult.I'm a very fucking bitter person.  I have so much resentment and anger bc I have literally zero supports for my disability and instead of actually trying to solve it or push through like a normal person it just turns into anger.  I have a deep-seated anger towards more disabled special needs individuals because they get more support and so I take my anger out by bullying and dehumanizing them online.  I'm always looking to start fights with anybody online and this has affected a number of my online relationships.  I'm not proud of this whatsoever obviously but I still fucking do it.  Besides that I just feel rly angry and judgemental towards people in general and I rly have a negative view of almost everybody I know besides my family and a few friends.I'm irredeemable.

And every time I take steps to make my situation better despite the anxiety I have of stepping out of that bubble, there's about 2 more things that'll knock me even farther back than everyone. I try to reach out to family and friends, but most of them will either say everything will get better and then go back to treating me as if I never reached out; or they'll just ghost me with zero regard. I tried to reach out to the therapists and forums like this, but they all either gave me the wrong numbers to places, stuck me in looney bins, told me to put up with life, or straight up ignored and didn't even answer any calls. And all that just to come back home to realize shit's getting too expensive for me and my family to live, and I'm out here thinking that my mother and siblings are better off without me. I'm wondering how it is that I do everything right, but I still get wronged. At this point, I'm just done. I'm gonna clean up a lil bit, and go off myself. The real question is, should I go catch carbon monoxide poisoning in my car, take some aspirin, cut myself up or wrestle the gun from my mother and use it on myself. I'm pretty sure I could do it, but there's like multiple ppl in the house right now and I'm kinda skinny.

1c500y3;How do I (40’sM) reach her (13F) before she makes an attempt?;pimppapy;My daughter has mild autism (high functioning). She is most like me in almost all the ways possible. I was personally taught, through religion, that suicide is a one way ticket to hell etc. when I was younger than her. For me I always had that to fall back on whenever the invasive thoughts made me consider ending it all. But as I got older, got an education in STEM and seeing reality for what it is, I ended up leaning towards agnosticism, so I lost the fear of hell. But simultaneously I had my kids, and the internet to teach me and fully understand that suicide is a selfish action. No parent should have to bury their child and at the same time no child should lose their parent to it. Because of that I see my own parents and children as my anchors and no matter how depressed I feel or how hard I want it to end, I’ve resigned myself to suffering in silence until it just happens naturally. One of the many curses of having this much empathy I guess. But now my daughters therapist is telling us her concerns on how she should not be left alone, needs to be distracted etc. but it’s not possible to be on top of her 24/7. We also feel when she notices the overbearingness of us, her parents, that it’ll cause another issue. She doesn’t open up to me the way she does with her therapist, nor as much as she does with her mom. But ironically, her mom only knows what’s she is told and has had no first hand experience with what she/I are going though. I feel like I made a mistake in not pushing them towards religion, even though I stopped pursuing it myself due to other issues that being in that community caused, that I didn’t want my kids to go through. How do I reach her without having her shutdown on me thereby fueling it further ….? I’m afraid she may see it as a betrayal by her therapist and make things worse.;My daughter has mild autism (high functioning).

1c4z9px;Fear of death is ironically making me wanna kms;Beautiful_Gain_9032;"the main reason is simply the fact that life is meaningless, and i i believe that ""making your own meaning"" is BS. if it helps people great, but my mind only follows what it thinks is true, not what it wants to be true. Telling me to create meaning in a meaningless world is just the same illogic of ""join a religion you know is false because it will give you meaning"". It doesnt work that way. Just because muslims, for instance, might feel a meaning to live from their faith, thats only because they actually believe it. Someone who doesnt believe it wont get meaning from islam because they dont think it has any basis. I see ""create your own meaning"" just as stupid as pretending to believe a religion i don't. if the religion isnt actually true, that means the ""answers"" they give for the meaning of life are also untrue.i have no reason to live. whats the point of anything? why work? to make money. Why make money? to pay bills. Why pay bills? so i have a home. Why have a home? so i dont die. Why not die? idk, im going to die anyways, all im doing is prolonging the inevitable.Thinking about death so much makes me want to die. every time i hear a news story about someone dying i feel intense pain for them, even criminals like OJ simpson, hearing he died the other day sent me into a spiral thinking about death. All i think about is death. What it will feel like, being horrified of when my time will come. Its a family members birth day, when i think about her age my mind automatically does the math and realizes i only have 20 more years with them, aka 1-my-lifetimes worth of time left max, if im lucky. Then i realize i only have 2x my current lifetime of time left to live before i die. I then get overwhelmed about everything i want and realize ill never get it because im disabled and too much of a social anxiety freak to even step foot outside my home, and too paranoid to share my secrets with anyone irl, let alone find someone who will ever want me. I wake up after 10 hours of solid sleep and feel like i havent slept in 10 days. If i walk .1 mile i feel like im going to faint and wont quit yawning for the remainder of the day, and cant stand because i get so tired. all i think about is death and how im slowly killing myself and i have no power to change it. All of this helplessness makes me just wish i had the courage to end it myself. That way theres no worrying about when, no more suffering, no more stress. But then my mind thinks about death again and wants to run away, but then the anxiety that death gives me makes me want to die.

1c4yse6;I regret telling my friend about how I’ve been feeling.;Alternative_Bit7133;A couple nights ago I opened up to one of my best friends about how I’ve been thinking seriously about ending my life. We had a long conversation, it made me feel better and I ended up making a promise that I wouldn’t kill myself. I made a similar promise to my mom recently after I opened up to her. Well to be totally honest I regret telling both of them. One, because I just gave them a metric fuckton of stress they know have to deal with. And two, because a few days removed from telling my friend my thoughts and feelings of suicide have gone right back to what it was before. Now if, or when I do end up ending my life that’s two more people who will be hurt even more by it. God why did I fucking tell them. If I didn’t and I killed myself then at least they could tell themselves they had no idea and there’s nothing they could’ve done.

1c4ylt4;Level 4 hoarding + 5th-grade dropout;Critical-Ad3329;this is a long ramble I might delete, Please give me advice and feel free to ask questions if it's confusingI am 14 f, I have not had my own bedroom since I was 4 years old. My mom made all the upstairs into a closet for her hoarding. I sleep on the couch, In 2018 they adopted a cat but never spayed her, It's led to a long line of them having kittens, them growing up and having their own, We have so many cats I have lost count, but I'd guess around 30. We struggle every week to afford food for them, The litterbox has not been cleaned in a year, and even when it was they never used it. Everything smells so bad of cat pee when you walk into the house it'll burn your eyes and nostrils. Everything is sticky from it being repeatedly peed on. There's dried cat feces on the floor everywhere, The only rooms not completely filled are the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. I've been homeschooled my whole life. We were doing an online course but they suddenly stopped paying for it when I was in the 5th grade and I haven't been in since. I am so tired of not being able to breathe, having no privacy, no friends, I am so tired of living like this. I'll never be able to get a job and move out cause I left school so early. I'll never get married, I'll never have a group of friends, I'll never even be able to leave this house. I want to tell my therapist so she'll call CPS, but I'm scared because I've heard how horrible it can be and I still love my family.

1c4ydyn;Goodbye;;"This is a throwaway account so don't worry about messaging me to change my mind or to sway me another way because there is no point. I just have no one to say goodbye to so I thought I would say goodbye to strangers on the internet as that seems sufficient enough. I also don't exactly know when I'll do it but I still feel intrinsically that I have to say goodbye, so I thought I'd get ahead with it.I am planning on dying sometime in the near future if things go to plan, just have to order the nitrogen gas to do it. It will be painless if done correctly and I will finally be gone.Here are some of the basics about me. I have been sick for most my life; mental illness, chronic conditions, incurable stuff ya know. I am not the brightest tool in the shed, in fact, I don't even believe I really even shine. Perhaps if I was smarter this wouldn't be my only option, but I am not, and I am too tired to do anything about it other than this as it is the most simple solution. I am not beautiful either, and I know the biggest rebuttal to that is that beauty is all subjective or specific to the beholder, but even then, I am not beautiful as it stands today which is all that matters personally on the subject of beauty for myself. I don't believe in God, though I was raised up Christian but after a particularly close call with death and a couple of other things, I personally have decided for myself that I don't believe God exists. My favorite color is blue and my favorite food depends on the day but I usually hover around sushi or chicken.I don't want this post to upset anyone, I just felt the need to say goodbye to someone, to pretend for a minute. If it's any consolation, I lived a relatively happy life, in fact, I would consider my very early childhood years as the happiest years in my life, things have of course changed since then, but I do have happy memories. I have been remising on good memories from when I was young as well recently, and those have provided me quite a bit of comfort throughout all of this, so just know that I won't be sad either. I feel at peace with all of this, in fact, I feel really relieved that my life will finally end. I am not nervous or scared, just content. It is almost as if I am floating in my emotions, not quite settling on one or the other, but just hovering above them.Reading back through this, I realize I am a bit scatterbrained in this post, but I feel like I've gotten everything out that I wanted to.So goodbye friends, may the world be a little brighter without me.";This is a throwaway account so don't worry about messaging me to change my mind or to sway me anothe;;0;1;2024-04-15 21:37:49;2024-04-15;Monday;21:37:49;2533;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-18 21:05:33.672444

1c4y3dx;Is this really how it ends?;imhaide;"Who cares about throwaways.  M25I've been struggling pretty significantly these past 3 years. Currently medicated, weaned off my old meds (Paroxetine) into a new one (Anafranil). It sucked, I tell ya. What I've dealt with, is agoraphobia, depression, anxiety and OCD. My psychologist wants to go further with my diagnoses, she suspects autism, personality disorder or aspergers.   Problem is, I cannot in my current state of anxiety even show up to actually get blood work, EKG or show up to appointments. My doctor (he works together with my psych.) prescribed Oxazepam, but I'm so deathly afraid of it. To not make it long, life has basically fucking sucked. A lot of medical emergencies and deaths in my family. Uncontrollable thoughts and rituals that will make me horrendously anxious if I do not do them. Dissociation, making things not seem real, endlessly a feedback loop to fuel my anxiety and panic. A failure, a family stain, someone who's weird, that guy that people says are ""Nice"" but I'm so fucking awkward. Rotting alone in my apartment, grasping to even have something, just SOMETHING to look forward to, trying so damn hard to have a consistent schedule. But for what?  The hatred I have for myself is out of control. My biggest enemy is myself, and I struggle to turn it around. Like, anything I fucking do, it does not matter, it'll be met with negativity and no praise, even the difficult hurdles. I try man... I try so fucking hard to not let things consume me, but I just have a feeling that I'm losing control. I've sincerely tried to turn things around. To have a schedule, to move myself, to change, to attend appointments, to conquer my fears, to meditate, to have a diary, to read self-help books, to listen to music, to look out the window, to get fresh air, to fucking end this illusion of danger, that my mind instates. I just cannot take it anymore. I want to feel real. I want to get out. I want to eat. I want to experience. I want to love. I want to experience life. I want to live. Please.I've really struggled to see what good would be on the other side. Working tirelessly and thanklessly at a job that probably drains my health even further? I really wanted to work with music, but anything creative is even more dead-end. At best a hobby on the side. Who'd even listen to the bullshit I even make? I've spent 10 years, and I've got nothing to show for it. I just want to live life. Not be a fucking cog in the system.  I've tried to end my life before. It failed, as I puked the medicine up. I will spare you the details. Suicide note prepped too.  To everyone on this subreddit; Life is not fair, and will never be fair. That does not mean you're not entitled to experience love, warmth, security. Try to be better to yourself. Kind of ironic I say this when I obviously could not, but it's a genuine request. I was not strong enough, and that's okay! Really, from the bottom of my heart, try. Exhaust every resource you have. It's okay to be egotistical, you're struggling after all. I think my biggest regret is seeing my mom trying her best to help me. No mother should ever see their child fall as far down as I have. She doesn't deserve it at all. My parents are really trying their best. I just cannot shake the feeling of being a leech, a fucking greedy pig, that takes and takes and takes. It makes me nauseous, that I, a 25-year old man cannot even fucking look after myself. It's so pathetic, so dehumanizing. I wish things would've turned out better. My siblings too.

Every single time it seems amazing and i'm super happy for the first little bit, then it just fades completely and i have no idea why. They just drift away and slowly start showing less and less interest in me before just cutting it off abruptly/ghosting me. And I never know why, I never get any reason as to why or anything i did wrong so I have no idea if im doing something bad that I can change about myself. I know im not controlling or abusive or anything like that, I strive to be the absolute best partner I can possibly be and will go out of my way to do anything for them. I really care about them so deeply and would never do anything to upset them. Its also not like im a loser or anything, im 20 in my junior year of a stem degree at a big college, i have a part time job/internship that i make decent money from (enough to go on dates and things like that).

1c4xjyd;How am I supposed to love myself when my friends and loved ones have burned me so many times?;seahawkspwn;"I'm just so sad. I try so hard to make meaningful connections and friendships and keep in touch with people without being a burden.Very rarely do people reach out to me. The ones I call and are aware of my problems seem to think everything is kosher and they don't need to ever check on me after I've told them that I literally want to be not around.They gaslight me when I say I want to have a higher bar for my relationships. For people to even put in half of what I feel like I do into my friendships would be wonderful. I went to a ""good friends"" wedding on the other side of the country in October. He has been in my city without hitting me up and hadnt seen me in like 5 years before I flew in for his wedding (since he graduated college a year ahead). My date, who I foolishly told everyone I'd marry someday, took away that the married couple looked happier than us and that we shouldn't be together. My friend who got married and his best man were friends a year ahead of me and I met both of them my freshman year of college. They treated me well but it was clear I was always below their friendship and in recent years they've gotten together to watch college basketball once a year in a conference tournament of their choice in March. For years I've just wanted to be a part of that or anything that will let us catch up and while they say they are my friend, that apparently is too sacred of a tradition to include me in beyond this pity year. They bought Tix to the games without me, hotel without me, and so I only sat near them a couple games the 3 days I was there out of 5 and had to get an Airbnb. I drove them all around and we had a good time, aside from the one night they got tipsy and started arguing so I left for my Airbnb to not get in the middle.My grandpa is dying, my parents aren't here, my relationship has left me shattered, my therapist keeps having a reason to reschedule me. The friends I try to make in my city don't seem to care about me and will never initiate conversation. Rarely want to do things. Girls will take my number or chat with me for a day and then ghost. I'm not even that ugly, why am I so undesirable and disposable?Why am I not enough. I'm so kind, I'm funny, I'm smart, I'm open minded and willing to do different things.For the life of me I can't seem to hold down a friend who doesn't eventually decide they don't need me. I still think about these people. Nobody from my past ever reaches out to me to see how I'm doing. Whether it's ex coworkers I was friends with at work or other college buddies or whatever, I don't cross anyone's mind.I wish I just was never born. My whole life I've felt this loneliness and I've tried to fill it however I can but the hole keeps getting bigger and bigger.I can't stop thinking about how I'd do it. I just want the emotional scars to heal. I just want people to want me for me.";I'm just so sad.

1c4xcxl;(M17) finally killing myself later tonight. Never been more confident;Routine_Total6865;"Title says it all, really. Tonight I'm gonna huff a fuck ton of deodorant until I pass out and eventually succumb to it. And honestly? I can't remember the last time I felt this happy/confident about something. I don't feel nervous at all, and I'm ready to welcome death with open arms. I can't wait.I've simply decided that I'm not cut out for this world or anything it expects of me. I lack any sort of motivation for doing well in school, keeping in contact with friends, getting fit, getting into dating (i.e. I've never been in a relationship or even kissed anyone yet, and I made a conscious decision to avoid both of those things a long time ago; meanwhile most people my age are fucking each other regularly), or anything like that. I honestly find it laughable that anyone would ever feel the need to do any of those things, to give you an idea of the mental state I'm in.So, in essence, I'm just deciding to cut everything short. It only makes sense, because I was never going to do anything with my life anyway. Just thought I might as well share this here before I go.

Now who’s the failure? You don’t need to be nice with me, I don’t deserve it and I’m fine with it. Please be good to your brain, I wish I would’ve been with mine … too late.

1c4vnf9;Finally letting go...;MirageMasterXS;"I don't even know how to start this or even why I'm typing words onto a screen right now. I just know that I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of giving. I'm tired of fighting. But most of all, I'm tired of loving too hard and being too much for people in a world that I don't feel like I even fit into anymore.  I sit here right now, in front of a screen, and all I can think back to is the night of July 6, 2021. That was the last time I fell apart enough to attempt ending the book that tells my story for good. For some reason that I don't understand ... it didn't end that night, no matter how badly I wanted it to and how much I wish it would have.  Why do I feel that way? Because ever since that night, the only things I've managed to do are push my closest friends and supporters away from me and cause pain in countless people's lives because I'm too broken or stupid to know what to do with my emotions. I know 99% of people won't believe me when I say this, but no one understands the depth of guilt I feel every day for everything that I've done wrong and everyone I've been a burden on or caused problems for. I wish every second of every day that I could take it all back, to a time when I'd never shared my struggles or the deepest parts of myself with anyone. If I could, then no one would ever have been hurt because of me. If I could, then no one would have had to push me away because I caused them problems and discomfort and chaos. It's never been fair to anyone.  Even if taking it all back would mean that I was completely alone in this life... I would accept that loneliness and personal pain because at least then, the only person who would be feeling any discomfort is me. I'd rather be hurting than ever have anyone else hurting by my words, my actions, or my existence.  My step-dad committed suicide in 2016, just before Christmas. For a long time, I was angry with him. I couldn't understand the depth of what he was feeling that pushed him to that breaking point and over that threshold. But over the past few years, I've grown to understand. I realize now what must have been on his mind, that sometimes, there are pains inside our minds and weighing on our hearts that are simply too much to overcome or live with. Because that's how I feel now.  When I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after my suicide attempt three years ago, I was scared in the moment because even though I had an explanation for why I feel things the way that I do, I also knew that there's no true escape from it. There's no combination of medications, no amount of surgery or treatments, that will ever make the broken parts of my brain work the way that they're supposed to. And that makes me unbearably angry inside, because I don't want to feel the way I do every day. I've been in therapy every week, sometimes every day, since my suicide attempt and I've grown to see my mental health struggles like I do cancer: a beast that even when it's asleep inside, never stays away forever.  No one on this earth, and no one who's been in my life over the years, deserves to have to deal with the chaotic mess that I am. Someone told me a while back that they couldn't be in the life of someone who causes chaos, and I finally understand what they meant by that. Because I am that someone. I'm so broken and jagged that I can't help but cut anyone who tries to pick me up or hold me close. It's inevitable. And it's why everyone should genuinely hate me and steer clear from me at this point, because I can't stand the thought of hurting anyone else.  Times like this, I sit here and I ask God, ""Why? Why did I have to be this way?"" I wish I knew the answer to that question. Because if I knew why, then maybe I could have changed it, or at the very least kept myself away from all the people that I eventually hurt and burdened.  At this point, I'm also wondering why I was born into an era where the world says, ""Handle your own issues, and let everyone else handle theirs."" Being alone is the worst feeling I've known in my entire existence. I thought that it was human nature to want to be around others, to feel included, and to have a group that one can belong to. But, at least according to today's world, that's not the case and I'm an outlier among a sea of people who don't want communication and don't want connection, at least not unless it can do something to benefit them.  I get that I'm not like 99.9% of the world, that my desire for consistent (not constant, but consistent) communication with those I care about and value isn't how the rest of society is built these days. I get that my depth of caring for others, my depth of feeling in general, is a lot and it's hard for me to put it in the right words, much less for anyone close to me to understand. But I love people, and especially those I let in, because that's how I'm built and it's all I've ever known how to do. I don't like conflict. I can't stand if I cause discomfort or disagreement. I've only ever wanted to love those close to me and be loved for myself in return. But who I am, what I am, and how I am makes that impossible.  I'm pouring my heart out here and putting it on my sleeve one last time because I know that, after this, I'm never going to again. When being authentic, letting my feelings out, and not hiding behind a mask only creates pain for those around me, then I'm going to keep the armor on. I'm not going to let anything out into the open anymore. That way, even if I am hurting, I'm the only one hurting. That's the best possible scenario.  I know this is hard for anyone to comprehend, but the depth and intensity of my emotions makes it physically painful when everything falls apart. As I'm typing right now, I feel like there's a hole in my chest, because I'm so overloaded that my heart just ... can't, anymore. I wish I didn't have to feel this way. Everything I've ever experienced, I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy because this ... everything that I feel inside ... is what I imagine hell on earth to be. Maybe it is my own personal circle of hell, because I haven't even gotten to that part ... but I know at my core that I can't possibly be a decent person. Not after the people I've hurt, the chaos I've caused, and the destruction I feel that I've dealt.  I feel lost in a pit of blackness because even in high school, I never envisioned making it this far. I never thought I'd make it to live as long as I have because even back then, the feelings of emptiness and worthlessness were eating at me. Even then, I never felt like me without the mask was enough for anyone. How can I be ""enough"" for anyone when I'm always too much? When no matter what I do, I only ever overwhelm and destroy the people I let in by the end of it all? Every single one of them, all of you ... you all deserve better than I've ever been.  I think this is the moment that I've finally lost any hope I might have had in myself that things would be OK. When you try to run from your inner self too long, it always catches you eventually. And it's given me the realization that I'm too broken, too abnormal, and too overwhelming to ever be able to function normally on this earth. The ones that I've let in know that, even if they haven't said it out loud to me.  That's the only other thing that has weighed on me in all this. Present-day society is such that the easiest course of action is to ghost someone, to swipe on to the next person, or to avoid any sort of communication when one feels uncomfortable instead of caring enough to be honest about things and wanting to try and fix them. I've made every mistake in the book, I feel like. I get it. I'm a bad friend, a bad person to be around, and an emotional weight because of my core self. But even when I've made mistakes, I've wanted to try and make things right. I've wanted to try and not lose friends, not lose connections, because I care about those relationships and they're valuable to me. But I understand now that I value people more than anyone will ever be capable of valuing my level of caring in return. That's not to say that people don't care, but I realize that people can't care like I care, because caring as much as I do is an abnormality. It's not what should be.  That level of valuing people is why I reached out first to others for so long. Because I care, and I'll always care, no matter what. But when I stop talking ... and no one is there to talk back because I didn't try anymore, that's when I realize that all I've been doing for the entirety of my adult life is ""watering dead plants,"" to use a phrase I learned when I was hospitalized. Just because I care about someone doesn't mean they care about me in the same way, and that's always been the hardest lesson that my brain has tried to wrap around in my entire life.  I wish I had a switch that I could flip to turn my emotions completely off. I'd rather feel nothing for the rest of my life than to continue to feel everything like a wildfire all the time.  If everyone in my life is pushing me away because I'm causing them problems and discomfort, because I'm too much in their lives, the easiest course of action is for me not to be there. Because at the end of the day, I want the world to be a happier place. And if the world is better because my pain isn't in it anymore, then at least I feel like I've done one thing right in a sea of mistakes.  I realize now that I'm jealous of my step-dad. Because he got the escape from his pain. Even my granddad ... who passed from cancer a little over a month ago ... he battled his mental health for many, many, many years ... including at the very end, and even though it wasn't what ultimately took him from us, he too got his peace from all the anguish he'd been feeling for so many years.  At this point, I just want peace from my own thoughts, my own feelings. I want peace from this violent roller coaster that makes me feel like I'm a helpless passenger in my own body and my own mind. I want to feel like I can truly be myself, but I know that not only is that not possible, it was never realistic in the first place. I let myself believe in ""what I wanted to be"" rather than in ""what reality is"" and that only ended up ruining my mental state even worse than what it was before I ever had any hope at all.  Therapy, medications, friends ... things always worked for a little while, but in the end I've always fallen back into this pit somehow. I guess ""who I really am"" is broken and empty, and that's how it's always been.  So many people have told me that I don't need to apologize for who I am, but I feel it's the opposite. I AM sorry. I'm sorry to every single one of you reading this and I'm sorry to all those who will never read this because they were already destroyed by me long ago and are probably glad that I've given up fighting. My deepest regrets will always be those I've lost because I was too blind to see my own faults in the first place. I've never forgiven myself for losing any of those relationships and I never will. That blame is my cross to bear for the rest of time.  I've wished for months that God would just strike me down, that in a single moment it would just ... all be over. I don't understand why he hasn't already, because it's what I deserve. When someone has caused the kind of damage that I have, the kind of hurt that I have, I don't deserve to still be here. I don't know why I am. I wish I had the courage, right now, to do what I tried to do three years ago and close the book forever. Because writing more pain into the pages of the world by being myself isn't worth living anymore. That's not living anyways.  I don't know what else to say that I haven't already said at this point. But for the few people who believed in me past the point when I could even believe in myself anymore ... y'all probably kept me going longer than I would have on my own. I hope y'all have all the happiness you deserve in the world and can live free of any more burden from me, because none of you should have ever had to stand underneath that cross with me.  To the ones who said I deserved to disappear out of existence, y'all were right.  And to those I love and care about, I'm sorry for loving y'all too hard. I wish I'd known a different way.  I'm going to stop typing now. If anyone made it all the way to this point... thank you for caring in that respect. Be happy, be well, and now y'all can be free of me. That's what's best for the world.  And please ... please don't waste any tears on me. I'm not worth the energy of being sad. I promise.I just had to write all this out. I had to get it out so that I can break completely and let go. I'm sorry.";I don't even know how to start this or even why I'm typing words onto a screen right now.

1c4vegx;I feel like I peaked in high school;Smolio84;I’m a 19 yo college dropout with what seems like no future. Despite how badly I wish it wasn’t true, I think the old fucks that say it are right: high school is the best time of your life. I hated high school. I hated waking up early to go do some random bs for 7 hours a day and then coming home to do even more work after that. I hated the condescension of every staff member towards me and I hated the helplessness of it all. Through my distain I found a way to make the best out of what felt like a bad situation. I was a duel sport athlete through all of high school. I played 4 years varsity hockey and 1 year varsity baseball ( 2 years JV and didn’t play junior year). I had a large social circle and felt comfortable enough to really be myself at school. I didn’t put too much thought into my future because honestly I didn’t want one. I have struggled with my mental health for most of my life, and I didn’t truly see a future for myself anywhere. I have passions for sure but they’re not suitable careers in my opinion. I decided I was gonna major in computer science and see what happens. 9 months after my first day, I’m now a college dropout with just a hope of becoming an electricians apprentice. With my whole life being dominated by sports and school, I never really made time to get a job in high school. I have zero credible work experience. My friends are all off at college or have jobs that keep them tied up most days. I’m the only one that’s doing nothing. I’m the only one that’s a complete loser.Even though I’m trying to get a job in case the apprenticeship falls through, it’s a bit difficult with no resume. My parents are screaming at me constantly to get a job, but somehow won’t accept a dishwashing job as real work. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. To whoever’s out the reading this, don’t grow up too fast. Enjoy your time in high school, even though it feels like a pain in the ass.

I'm tired of working so hard to make so little. I found a shift that pays five dollars an hour more than what I make now, had more hours and yet more days off. I had recently found out my insurance through work doesn't cover some things that are very important to me (I am a transgender man and have been paying out of pocket for testosterone for years) and the Amazon job would have covered it and more. I'd done the math, $950 a month more than I make now. Enough for a dental bridge. I had 7 teeth surgically removed due to dental neglect as a kid and grinding my teeth. I have tmjd which causes my jaw to do all sorts of painful things. I need the bridge. I applied for care credit specifically because I would have been able to afford the payments with my new job.Then the day came to go in and turn in my i9 documents and I couldn't find my social security card anywhere so I missed the appointment. It was too late to reschedule and they've removed me as a candidate for that position. You have to understand this is a shitty thing on top of a huge pile of shit that is my life. And now because I lost this job opportunity and I'm so poor I have to cancel the only fun thing I had in my future because I won't be able to afford it.

1c4u82h;i wasted too much of mine and others time.;rancidbunny;"i met the love of my life after being in so many godawful relationships. Ive had a knife to my throat, pistol whipped and forced on even after making my r@p3 known to my partners. Its never once been respected apart from my current partner but even than ive managed to muck up the first and only good one and its too much for me, too much guilt for me to bear, im not religious but after pleading with god and praying for some kind of savior and here my blessed wife came. Yet here i have gone and sullied it; ruined beyond belief because I thought i was ready for some good only to find out the people i grew to despise and hold ill intent for are the ones who rubbed off on me the most, another rotten apple next to the rest no different. I didnt cheat on her if thats what youre wondering; i lied. I hid my past. I just wanted to bury it and move on but it always creeped its way in, messages with my mother that i didnt delete, pictures saved to my iCloud but not my iphone gallery i fucked up plain and simple and after telling her she was special and one of a kind that was stomped on after she saw old pictures maybe a video here and some messages about them with my Mother or sister. It was all ruined. Watching her turn miserable already made me feel horrible i took away that untouchable feeling of her position being one of a kind. she is truly one of a kind and she has no clue and it blows my mind. Whoever takes my place in her life after i pass i pray they are everything she ever wanted and more; god bless i hope all the struggling/wavering souls in here find peace and love and win those battles.

I could go to Meetups and we can argue about how abortion is wrong in almost all cases, how you can't actually change your gender, and how there is no patriarchy. But I don't think I'm ever going to like it here.Or I could just muster the courage to walk in to a gun store and shoot my bigoted self. (That's what you're thinking, right? I'm a bigot.

I would do anything for that person why can't I be loved. I stopped cutting myself some time ago but I am so deep in my loneliness and depression that I want to start again. I started smoking again but it's not good enough I want more I need it the pain in my chest won't leave and I feel like I am drowning. I always wear a jacket anyway so no one will see it and no one will ask me why I wear a jacket because I always do. I dont know what to do anymore I am so lost. I hate feeling like I am bothering people when I text them. I am talking to this girl she is a old school friend and I want to get to know her not to date her I am just lonely and want someone to talk to. OK maybe I want to be loved but yeah. But every time I text her she takes so long to answer and I get that she has school and that we live in different time zones i am 17m BTW. Every time I ask if I am bothering her or if she wants me to stop texting she eathe ignore me and answer a other question I ask but not that or she said I am not bothering her and that she does want to chat. But I don't feel like she does. Plus I am so scared she sends me stuff like a (x or 🫶) and I never know if it's as a friend or if she likes me last girl that told me she loved me and stuff ended up telling me she likes me as a brother Anyway I do t know what to do and I can't just tell the girl I am talking to how I feel and that I am scared and depressed because 1 that would be weird 2 I would seem like a weak idiot 3 she would probably not answer and skip the text.Sorry I know its not well written and most of it does not make sense if you red everything thanks and hope you have a good day;I am not well I feel like shit and my emotions are all over the place.

Idk maybe a brain injury, a bus hitting me, a fatal accident of some sort, I even wish I had c4ncer so I knew I would die soon. I just want to end it all but don't have the courage. I am sitting on the couch trying to not think about it but I cant help it, nothing distracts me from the feeling. I tried eating, watching a movie, colouring a stupid picture, reading, I can't sleep and I don't have anyone to go out with.

1c4txkj;I think it's finally time;Jolly_Ad626;I just wanted to leave this here.. because I'm not telling anyone and I'm not leaving a note. I'll just leave this here and it's all I even have the energy to say...My life has been riddled with childhood abuse, relationship abuse, mental illness and even single time I make progress... I literally lose everything.I had a baby 7 years ago. I took care if her 247. She went to ever doc appointment. Never a rash. Never a bruise. Never a scratch. Hit every growth goal. Extremely healthy..  I was depressed while I was pregnant. The father tried to strangle me and kill me when he found out I was pregnant... then he left and when she was born caused nothing but he'll in my life. So I had to take welbutrin because I would have killed myself 100 percent without it. Well when I had her I went to a psych and got on the meds  I needed. I was drowsy and fell asleep late one night watching TV after I tucked her into bed and my brother heard her crying before I did. So they called cps. Cps couldn't do anything at all bc nothing had been done wrong! I did everything to take perfect care if her.. so my mother kicked me out while cps was there and I had nowhere to go   they told me since I no longer had a place to live, she'd go to foster care or I'd have to adopt her out.. hearing the foster system.horror stories I adopted my perfectly healthy, beautiful child who I loved more than anything in this world. The woman said I could visit her whenever but as soon as u tried she threatened to say I was attempting kidnap which literally broke me completely.  I was left with no baby. No home. No family     after that I got on heroin. I couldn't cope. I eventually got clean and to this day I'm sober...Yet since being sober I've realized all the horrible things that have happened to me. I have been raped. Forced to watch someone being raped.. waterborne. Stalked. Arms beaten so badly I could not move them. Hands so bruised I couldn't work. Black eyes.  Strangled until i passed out several times. And then finally when I think my life is getting back on track... my fiance tells me I am the worst thing to ever happen to him and that I ruined his life. How? He cannot tell me. This is a sick place full of sick people and I simply won't tolerate it for another day. I wish everyone the best.. please don't abuse people. Please don't scheme on people. Love your children.. it matters so much... im getting a helium tank today and going quietly in the woods. I dont want anyone to find me. I have been hurt abd wringed everybturn of the way. I do better for myseld. Work extremely hard... its still taken away. This life is nothing but a curse.

1c4twfx;Nothing left ;reidecksdark;Since I was 12 I've always wanted to do it but after all the hospitalizations, residentials and cycling through every SSRI I thought it got better. My drunk mom would sometimes argue and escalate to the point of her suckerpunching me and calling the cops but couch surfing is cool and I eventually ended up living with my grandma. Highschool was easy, very anxiety inducing but not much to complain about. Got bullied for being gay in elementary school but never in highschool. By the end of it I got a No Child Left Behind full ride scholarship to a good school in my town. Then one of my friends died. We talked and cuddled occasionally and I had accidentally outed him by telling one of my friends out of excitement. He had told me about him cutting himself and suicidal ideation and I tried to talk him out of it as much as I could before I told a counselor. He got a girlfriend and we drifted apart before someone came up to me one day to tell me he drowned on his own vomit in his sleep. It broke me but I was about to graduate so I tried to keep going.  One day my grandma started arguing with painters outside her door and I started arguing with her because they were doing their jobs. It escalated to the point where I punched a filing cabinet and pushed her over. I went back to couch surfing after that. I started taking whole bottles worth of lithium and whatever I had and fell asleep. I'd always just throw it up and never tell anyone. Then she died of cancer and I never said goodbye.I'm living on my own now. No friends. I insulted a man who I'd dream about dating in highschool just because he didn't talk to me. I don't have to feel bad about someone finding my body anymore. I have no goals or aspirations. I have to dissociate to get through anything outside out of anxiety. I hate everything about this life. No matter what you do, something just always pushes down the Domino's. I'm so sick of hurting. It's heavy and I'm scared.;Since I was 12 I've always wanted to do it but after all the hospitalizations, residentials and cycl;;0;2;2024-04-15 18:41:55;2024-04-15;Monday;18:41:55;1951;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 21:05:31.628954

I tried every dating app and i have gotten nothing except getting called an incel. Maybe i am just a worthless incel. I already know i am not worth loving. I haven't earned anybody's love. I have been told nobody deserves anything good and that only god gives us good things. I have not been religious for 4 years now but i at least know that i don't deserve anything good, and since there is no god, i will never truely deserve to be loved. I have to earn it.

I had a therapy session already and i keep delaying the next one because it just costs too much. If i was dead, my family wouldn't have to worry about money as much and they would end up happier.

It took some work but I made it through. Recently however I’ve found my way back to rock bottom. A lot of it stems from my experiences with a close friend of 5 years stabbing me in the back recently but it’s compounded by a lot of other things going on in my life. There are a lot of life goals I wanted to achieve by now that just feel out of reach (getting a girlfriend, having an active social life, not having to live with my parents etc). I’ve tried putting effort into each of these to make them happen in the past but the sheer amount of failure, especially with dating has burnt me out completely. I’m at a point now where I can feel myself completely giving up on not just my romantic life, but also my other personal goals.

1c4t6k9;(Sorry for my English, it's not my native language);DEMONHAPPYEND;"I don’t know why I’m writing this, because I know that I’m a fucking loser and I don't deserve the right to speak. However, several websites told me to talk or speak up, but since there is no one in my life, I decided to voice it here. It seems to me that this is unlikely to help me, but I’ll try anyway.  I want to kill myself, I wrote down why below. However, I just have no help, all the internet sites say that ""to get rid of suicidal thoughts, talk to your friends or have fun."" I have no fucking friends and there is nothing interesting in this world for me.I have been living in Germany for several years, however I am from an poor Eastern European country. I have problems with the language (German), I have terrible grades, because the teachers simply refuse to help me, they force me to write texts without using a translator or at least a dictionary, so my texts are very terrible from a grammatical point of view and I just get terrible grades for this. I already repeated the school year because of bad grades, but because of the terrible attitude of the teachers towards me, I have to repeat another school year. I want to say that I am already several years older than my peers.  Because of my bad language, I have absolutely no friends. (I used to have friends in my homeland, but they rejected me and we no longer communicate). The Germans just don't accept me, I'm trying to be funny, I'm trying to be interesting, I'm just trying to be a fucking normal person. However, the Germans simply do not accept me. I'm the worst student. I'm bad at absolutely everything. There is not a single thing that I am better at than anyone else. I'm bad at everything. I have the worst grades in the whole school. I get ridiculed all the time, I get bullied and people just hate me.  P.S. Changing schools is not an option, I have already changed 4 schools in total.  Of course, I've never had a girlfriend. I've never been on a single date and I've never celebrated Valentine's Day because I'm fucking ugly. Previously, in my homeland, I was quite active and I talked with many girls, but every time, any conversation had several endings:  -ignore  -block  - “Sorry, I’m no longer interested in you” / “Sorry, I found someone else”  From every conversation, no one explained to me what I did wrong and what my problem was. Either ignore or block.  My parents hate me. There wasn't a single day when they just calmly talked to me. Every day they shout at me, sometimes they beat me up, simply because I (for example) forgot to wash the dishes because I came in very tired. Every time I try to talk to my parents about a serious topic that is important to me, my parents reduce the conversation to the fact that I am a fucking loser.  A few years ago, I found a purpose for myself. I wanted to move to Japan and make manga. However, this whole journey was terrible. All the people (including my parents) to whom I told my goal laughed in my face and said that I would not achieve anything and would die in poverty. And the most offensive thing is that they are fucking right. I learned to draw for several years, but my maximum was curved geometric shapes, although I drew for several hours every day. Time passes, and I still remain a fucking loser. What else do you need for manga? Write interesting stories and know Japanese. I write various stories, but not a single person in the world will read what I wrote, because no one cares. Japanese is the most fucking difficult language in the world, I'm trying to learn it, but I can't do it without a teacher. I can’t hire a teacher, because this requires money, my parents don’t give me any money at all (they will never give money for a teacher), and I can’t go to work, because if I go to work, my grades will become even worse.   It makes no sense for me to live a life. I have absolutely no one who even cares about me. My goal is impossible for me, except for the work of a mangaka, I don’t see myself anywhere at all. I can’t fucking do anything, I’m fucking ugly, I have no motivation to live, every day is the same. I’m not mentally healthy, I need to go to a mental hospital, but my parents won’t let me go anywhere. I want to kill myself, but I'm scared because I'm a fucking loser and I cannot look into the eyes of death.  The only good thing is that in a year I turned 18 and I’m sure this will be the last year of my life if I don’t go to another world earlier.If you read to the end, then thank you very much.

1c4t3gg;I don't think it's possible to get better;ConfectionInitial397;When I was younger my mom was emotionally abusive and my dad was emotionally, physically abusive and neglectful because of this Ive wanted to die since I've been 7. I also grew up being an undiagnosed ADHD/autistic. I was bullied severely at school and lost all my friends 2 year ago. When this happened I tried to runaway from home after I realised there wasn't anything to attempt suicide with. My life got alot better since then, My parents have changed and they are no longer abusive, I no longer get bullied at school and I have a friend but even so I still don't want to live. A week ago I attempted suicide, which isn't unusuall for me because I've been trying since I've been 9 years old but this time I done it because my dad told me he cared about me and I didn't believe him so I thought this would be the best way to test out if he actually did. About a months ago I attempted because my friend didn't answer my message and the only thing I could think about is that she had finally had enough of me and that she hated me and was going to leave me. I don't get why I done it bcs i don't want to die but I don't want to live eathier. I just feel like such a shitty person all the time and that I don't deserve to live.

1c4sb04;Feeling depressed and borderline suicidal ;wicxaphase24;I'm a 26 year old female living in London. I have a child and a partner I live with, my friend group isn't extensive and I can't talk to them about my mental health because they're tough love approach sort of people and I'm very emotionally heightened. I lost my job in November and my partner lost his in January we've been applying for jobs every day but we've stopped even getting responses, not even rejections. Our finances are so bad I've resorted to shop lifting our dinners which has resulted in multiple bans from multiple places, for context I'm not a criminal, I've lived alone since I was 16 my relationship with my family is turbulent to say the least and I've had to support myself since I was a teenager I have done nothing but work since I was legally able but recently things have been hard. I've had to start selling things I love like my clothes and collectibles even bedding and furnishings just so I can make ends meet. My best friend died in December and everything's sort of been a downhill slope from there. I'm so embarrassed and angry at myself I hate myself for letting my family down and making myself look like a fool in the process. Something I've been afraid to tell anyone is that I sometimes think if I killed myself then this would all go away? The crippling debt, the embarrassment, the constant reminder in the back of my mind that I'm a failure. The voice in my head is so loud right now telling me I would save everyone a lot of headache if I just jumped off my balcony. Sometimes I think even if it didn't work at least maybe people would finally understand that I'm suffering. I get everyone has problems but I'm in a constant battle of heart vs mind. Do I steal or do I starve my head says do it and my heart says you're not a criminal don't be one. I can't do it anymore I need help I've called the samaritans I've spoke to mind everyone tells me I'm not a bad person but I feel like a useless person like a waste of a skin sort of person, like I'm inhabiting space someone else would have made way better use of. Does that make sense? I don't know. I don't have anyone and if I tell my partner I'm this depressed he will just spend every day on edge and I don't want that for him. What do I do?

For years I’ve been trying to tell myself that shits gonna get better, but the grass is never greener on the other side. I just graduated, bought a cool car(paid 5000 cash for it), but now I only feel stuck. But good thing I’m 100k in debt and can’t find an actual job for my business degree. Then the jobs I do just get me enough to earn ends meet, feels like I can’t even save or invest unless I heavily budget everything I do. My current job is so boring and tedious; I don’t have patience for it and the entire time I just rethink my life and apply to other places. But guess what, the grass aint greener! Everywhere wants 5 years of experience, and entry level spots don’t exist. So i just gotta get anything to make money. It’s pathetic. I legit have nothing to look forward to in life, and don’t want to enjoy my goals at 60-70 years old. I have all of 3 friends that I met through online gaming, and 0 physical love life. I feel like I relate to nobody except my 3 homies, I wish I had their mental fortitude to just slave away at the system. What ever happened to the american dream? I look back and see endless opportunity back in the day, before you could work full time pushing shopping carts and own a home with a single income. Family values in this country and across the world died, I will never own anything like my grandparents or parents. In fifty years i’ll die alone with nothing to my name, that or I’ll end up killing myself speeding in my car one day.

I've already been to one years ago and i felt tense and unconfortable. I alao don't want my family looking at me with pity and worry again. I hate it, it makes me feel sick. I thought i could wait until i got a job and moved out my parent's house but 4 months later i haven't found anything and since my field most of the jobs are telematic and my parents of course told me i should stay if i get one of those and save more money.I don't deserve their kindness. I'm a horrible person. I yern for friend but always push anyone who approach me and feel unconfortable talking to them just to cry minutes later and hate me more but then i took 5 years to cut my toxic relatiomship with my old friends. I'm stupid and dumb. I thought i was fine being alone, and i certanly like it. I like being alone but sometimes feel lonely. I don't make any sense.I hate myself.

Well it was a bad time and it took me a lot of time to get somehow okay but I did. However, my way of coping with bad feeling was hurting myself and eventually my parents found out. I didn't get much of support from them but I went to therapy. I thought it helped me and I got better so I finished it. But I didn't tell everything to my therapist, didn't tell her about my suicide attempts and how I was really feeling, I don't even know why I didn't tell it. I was sure I was better, the person I love came back to my life, my parents started treating me a little better and I got better at school. But now I feel like it's going bad again and there's no reason for this. I started hurting myself again because I don't know how to stop feeling bad, and suicidal thoughts are here again. I think about my last suicidal attempts and I have this feeling like I miss it, like I wish I did it. How can I get better?

1c4rglf;Does the suffering never end?;Existingcause1;I remember years ago I used to fear death.  The fear that atheists are right and there is no God.  When are physical body fails that is it.  That there is no point whatsoever to our existence.  I've always believed in God, but these never ending years of suffering has me believing  less and less. My faith wavers more and more with each passing hour, knowing my life's only going to get progressively worse from here. If this is it and we have just one life, in my case one miserable life,  I'm actually starting to look forward to eternal death if that's the end result.  There's a comfortness in it.  No suffering at all just peaceful non existence. Already living a life of non existence anyway, it's just not peaceful. I just want the fucking peacefulness. 😞 I'm so tired. My family is the only reason I'm still here, I don't want them to suffer.  But I don't know how much longer I can hold out for them.;I remember years ago I used to fear death.

1c4r37f;What horrible being am I?;TkfjfjcjcjcJcckckcjz;"I questioned the authenticity of my humanity before, I never felt basic human desires, I never starved for happiness. Today's event made me think about this once again. A close friend of mine revealed their suicidal thoughts after I spoke with them about their emotional presence. ""I don't want to worry you or scare you, but my suicidal thoughts have been growing lately"", they said. Since a long time, I have felt something. I thought to myself ""why I would be scared"", "" why would I be worried""; I know the consequences of suicide but neither am I worried nor afraid of loosing this person. ""Please don't worry about me"" they said, but all I worry about is the lack of humanity in myself, as an egoist does. ""I don't want to scare you"" they said, but you are worthless to me.  It depresses me seeing this human, who in the past often said how worthless they felt, feel of value once but be wrong; simply I can not give them any value in my life. Of course, I am supporting them, of course I give them a feeling of value and hopefulness. I know how they feel and aided them before. I just can't comprehend how such a close person is worthless to me...  Furthermore, I can't tell if their death would move me, certainly there is something wrong with me, but what?

1c4qtav;I am falling downhill ;Fogeythedinosaur;"I feel like I'm battling with myself to keep myself alive. The only reason why I haven't taken my own life yet is because I am a coward who keeps failing at it. I'm in constant pain, quite literally, suspected arthritis or auto immune disorder but no positive test yet so not sure what is the reasoning. They only want to treat my symptoms which increases my suicidal ideation and doesn't help with my pain at all. The best way for me to explain it is every single joint in my body is inflamed and stabbing me, it's like I have gravity multiplied on me because everything feels heavy. I feel like I struggle to stand as my whole body shakes as it struggles to hold my weight. Most days my pain sits at a 7-8, but for the past month or so I've been at a 8-10. It's not getting any better and I've given up on healthcare all together. Despite all of my best efforts so far nothing has decreased the pain, I am only getting worse. My health continues to decline, to where now I'm experiencing nausea, moderate food aversion, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue everyday. I feel like I am already dying and I have no support system. My partner is a selfish man who only considers his wants and needs. Despite me telling him exactly what I need to feel supported/helped it seems he does the exact opposite. I say I want to live away from the city and he is still looking for homes in the city. Before we lived in our current apartment I requested at least a yard, at least a yard our kids can play in. We are now in a second story apartment building. I'm struggling to go up and down the stairs.I also suspect he thinks I'm pretending, exaggerating, or faking my health issues, despite 4 years of this experience he still downplays and invalidates me. He had a herniated disc that he received surgery for, so of course his pain is more than mine. Of course he is the priority and how dare I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. I'm just a lazy bitch who needs to do more. I have no family, my mother died when I was young and everyone else is toxic. They are a family that enables narcissists. So of course I am the bad person for always calling them out for their poor behavior. I'm the root of everyone's problem, I'm the reason my dad's an alcoholic, I'm the reason my brother is poor and still living with dad and becoming/is an alcoholic, I'm the reason my sister is in an abusive relationship, I'm the reason my youngest sister is miserable, I'm the reason for everything bad. Apparently I am a worthless good for nothing that should just roll over and be their doormat. If I don't and request my most basic of boundaries be respected they shit all over it and do what they want anyways. So after years of trying, I cut them off. Then there is the state of the world, it doesn't want me living in it. Why do I try so hard to change a world that doesn't want to be changed? Why do I strive to have a better future that I will probably never experience? Then the cherry on top of all of this is I have a panic disorder and CPTSD, it's leading to symptoms of agoraphobia. I have bad panic attacks outside, to the point I am gasping for air and getting tunnel vision. I'm not going to be able to be proactive on my own when I can barely walk outside my apartment. So I'm rehoming all my pets but my cat, as I know he will actually be taken care of by my partner. I have distanced myself from almost everyone I know. So even if I did have a support system, that died years ago when I stopped reaching out. I kept telling myself it's because ""they deserve better"" especially my dog who doesn't get the full activity he deserves. I kept telling myself it's for their best but there's also that little voice that's saying ""you don't deserve them"". That I am not a good enough person to take care of any pets, that I am a shitty terrible owner and they'd all be better off without me. I've realized I made a lot of steps towards suicide. I am disassociated and detached from the world. My motivation continually decreases. And my health makes it hard to really want to fight or advocate for myself. It's been me taking care of myself for my entire life. I didn't get to have a childhood, I haven't had the ability to just rest and relax and have a normal life. All I have done is suffer, and I just want the suffering to end. And in order for that to happen I have to make a lot of decisions that quite frankly I don't think I have the energy to make. So it just seems much easier to let myself rot, to stop fighting, to stop trying. Because despite how hard I try, despite how much effort I make, I am always in the same spot, crying about something else, and wanting to die. Life really isn't worth it if there's nothing but suffering in store for you.";I feel like I'm battling with myself to keep myself alive.

I used to be super suicidal when I was around 13, got worse when I turned 15. My depression stemmed from a lot of trauma and the environment I was in. Life has gotten significantly less stressful and easier to manage in a way, I don't feel like I need to be on survival mode anymore. I have a job, I hang out with my friends, I  make music, I also started going to therapy but... somehow I still feel like I don't want to do any of this. I feel exhausted from living, and I know Im only getting started with life but Im not sure I can keep up with the ups and downs. The main issue Im having right now is that my family is struggling financially which makes it harder for me to pursue the plans I had for my future because we need to eat, it is a CONSTANT struggle. Never ending. I know it's too soon to think everything is doomed. But as I said before, I AM TIRED. I don't know where people get the strength to keep going.

1c4prp3;Potentially lost my last client, feeling partly suicidal. ;ToeAdministrative802;Hi guys,For context, I've been a freelance writer for a while. Never thought I'd get to this position, my last  long-term client, whom I work with on a basis of pitching ideas to which said client always responds and commissions, has ghosted me. No, they haven't been fired. They still work with the company. Now I'm feeling completely lost, my other pitches aren't getting a response, the potential clients who had reached out sometime ago all ghosted (they just fail to respond to my emails) even after doing splendid work (sample work) for them, their words. Sad to see that all the big bylines I acquired over the years have not been enough to secure me good gigs. I have thought of just looking for a full time job but unfortunately, I live in a third world country where so many people are unemployed, and all the people I know got their jobs through connections, despite not being so qualified. Unfortunately I don't have too many connections. I majored in Economics and have experience in finance and accounting but that hasn't been enough to land me a full time job in my country. I honestly don't know what to do at this point, switch to SMM? Technical writing? Finance and crypto writing? Or just go back to school and pursue the only courses where you are assured of a job in my country, teaching or nursing? (medicine is too pricey) Or maybe do CPA until the final level and maybe try to get a job in international firms? I honest don't know anymore. I have around $7k in savings but I don't know the best way to use it since it seems like everything I do fails. I'm tired and tbh I have contemplated suicide because what's the use of living if nothing seems to work out? I find it unfair how some people don't have to struggle in life, some people in my country don't even know what LinkedIn is yet have great jobs.

1c4pjzj;Brain Cancer Conqueror, feel utterly hopeless;Leynahlia;The last 7 years of my life (I’m now 27) I’ve been going downhill fast. I developed some weird mental obsession that drives me crazy day in and day out everyday. The moment I stop thinking about it, I realize I’m not thinking about it which in turn makes me think about it.In July 2023 I had a seizure one morning. Woke up in the ambulance covered in blood. They found a tumor the size of an apricot occupying my left frontal lobe. They operated 10 days later and removed nearly the whole tumor. No chemo or radiation as of yet. I wish the cancer had taken me out. I can’t feel joy anymore. I can’t feel satisfied. I only feel despair and impending doom and severe anxiety. I’m always tired and exhausted. I have 0 motivation. 0 drive. Not even a few weeks into my recovery my dad calls me, sees me sleeping and told me to “Wake the fuck up” dude who physically and emotionally abused my entire family my whole life.I was developing discipline these last few months. Cold showers. Exercise. Eating right. But now I’m just falling back out of it. Therapy doesn’t help. I don’t want medication. My poor mom does everything in her power to care for me and give me the tools I need to succeed. Yet I wake up every morning and feel hopeless. Traumatized. Broken.My girlfriend who was with me through all of the cancer and recovery finally told me she didn’t see long term potential with me. But wanted to keep fucking. I said nah let’s just end it here. I want to end it all. I want to go find some fent snort it and be gone from this world. Nothing helps and the life I truly want is too painful to pursue for the chance at never making it. I don’t want to be a slave.I’d rather die.;The last 7 years of my life (I’m now 27) I’ve been going downhill fast.

1c4ph12;Achievement Unlocked: Rubbing Alcohol!;ssqp781;"Posted on a drunken middle of the night (20 hours ago, via rubbing alcohol in my bathroom); I did drink my parents' rubbing alcohol in their bathroom later, and I've yet to succumb to chemical poisoning. Anyways...Clearly, I have a problem.  I had a problem when I resorted to drinking from a mini bottle of hand sanitizer at uni.  And also when I drank a bottle of mouthwash at new years, alone at home, after being sober for exactly one month.  And after that when I gradually consumed all of my mom's various kitchen 'extracts' at home which contain alcohol.  I turned 27 on Friday, I still live with my parents, and I'm a massive burden financially and emotionally on my family, as well as everyone that associates with me. Therefore, I've thought to myself for a while now that if I make it to 27, I have one year until I stop being 27 to ELIMINATE MYSELF, and once I turn 28, I should certainly aim to live the rest of my life, however long that should be. But, until my 28th year comes, ALL BETS ARE OFF, essentially.  Seemingly, I become slightly more suicidal than unusual when I'm highly intoxicated. I'm still not sure if rubbing alcohol diluted with water would ACTUALLY induce drunkness, it's been worth a shot over the course of the day.  I don't have anymore in my bathroom, but my parents might in theirs.  tldr: I'm just a smug choir nerd can I at least graduate before I die";"Posted on a drunken middle of the night (20 hours ago, via rubbing alcohol in my bathroom); I did dr";;0;2;2024-04-15 15:45:32;2024-04-15;Monday;15:45:32;1392;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 21:05:33.161629

1c4p6bk;I don’t want to be here anymore;Conscious-Charge-847;I’m a 24 year old trans man who is struggling with depression and PTSD. I’ve been struggling with chronic depression for more than 10+ years, as young as 12. I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideations and attempts since 13. This is just a vent because I don’t have anyone I can tell this to nor have I ever shared it with anyone. I don’t know what to do at this point, it feels like I’ve tried everything. Nothing excites me, I don’t feel anything towards anyone or anything anymore, and it’s been this way for a while. The only reason I’ve stayed alive for as long as I have is because of one thing- which was to get my dream job so that I could help others with my own life experiences. I worked towards this goal throughout high school and college- even now I am enrolled in a master’s program to further my skills for his job. I got promoted to this position last year and went through a 6 month academy and a 2 month training program to get to the final field training program that lasts 4 months. I’m about halfway through the program and I noticed the entire time, I’ve been experiencing nothing but back to back extreme depressive episodes and I don’t know why. The one thing I worked towards to stay here is just not what I was expecting or it didn’t bring me the happiness I thought it would. I feel like a burden to everyone around me, that they would be better off without me around having to clean up my messes. I keep fucking up at my job and making it worse. I don’t have anyone in my life to talk to or would care if I was gone. Other than this job, I have nothing. I feel angry, upset, and tired all the time. I’ve lost at least 10 pounds from the stress I’ve been putting myself under the last few months. I even had a breakdown at a re-certification training for firearms because I was fucking up my qualification so bad in front of everyone along with all the stress I’ve been under- I’ve never cried in front of people, so it was embarrassing and humiliating. Everyone around me is just happy all the time with a great support system, and I feel like I will never achieve that, no matter how hard I try or how bad I want it. I don’t think I can do this for another 30 years, constantly feeling depressed, lonely, and angry all the time- it’s just not worth it anymore. The depression and PTSD is too much for me and I just can’t handle it anymore nor do I want to. I’m sure I would just be doing everyone a service if I just killed myself. With this job, I have access to a firearm now that makes it relatively painless for my to kill myself versus other methods I’ve tried in the past. Since I probably won’t pass this program, I’ve given myself to the end of June to get everything together to make it easier for people to clean up when I’m gone. Anytime I try and reach out for help, I get the same cookie-cutter answers of just ‘eat healthy’ and ‘do hobbies,’ making it seem like depression is just something you can snap out of. Whenever I get answers like that it just makes me feel more angry, like no one truly understands how crippling and disabling it is to be like this all the time. If it were that easy, I would have done it but it’s not. All I feel like doing is sleeping and doing the bare minimum to get life essentials done. I’m too fatigued to care about anything else- sleep is the only time I can get my mind to turn off when I don’t have nightmares.  At this point, this post is just a vent, so feel free to scroll. If anyone has had similar experiences or advice on similar situations I would appreciate it- maybe feel less alone.;I’m a 24 year old trans man who is struggling with depression and PTSD.

I'm also genetically fucked up, and this fucks up my head and bring a lot of mental issues.What I have: Anxiety and severe depression for sure. Probably OCD. Maybe a bunch of other things as well.So, there's this thing. There's this person. She's perfect and the best so please do not say anything bad about her. But in 2018 she said some things that were triggers for me. Since then some things have been said and happened that were like triggers scattered throughout the years. But the main ones occurred in 2018 and 2019. Those triggers are related to a main thing, which I will refer to as ""blue"" from now on.I never ever liked blue, I was pretty sure I did not want blue in my life at all. But then with all those things related to blue being said/happening, something slightly changed in 2019, because I thought about blue in a different way but in two occasions for a few minutes only. Then, skip to 2021. I had a lot going on, living alone, fucking depressed, angry, and I was like ""you know what? I'm gonna search on the internet about blue"" Idk why, I think I wanted to hurt me emotionally but Idk why. And then BAM! I discovered a FUCKING NEW ENTIRE WORLD EXISTS, the signs, the names, the stuff...Since then I've been reading/watching/learning about blue every time I have a free time, it's taking over control of my life. In 2021 I still was tricking my mind that I was seeing things related to blue just for a different reason, that I did not want blue in my life. I was just lying to myself. Things started to slowly change in 2022, then in 2023 it took control and I was all for blue. But sometimes I'm reluctant.And now it is fucking ruining my life. I don't know if she really wants blue or if I misinterpreted. But why did she say all those things? fuck my life. I'm going insane.Aftermath: I want to kms so this mess in my head will stop. This is not the only reason I'm currently suicidal, but this thing is taking. a HUGE toll on me.People who do blue of course encourage this. But when I read normal (i.e. vanilla) people talking about this, they're disgusted. Actually even people who do blue say this may have bad results. IDK WHAT TO DO. I CRY EVERYDAY AND THINK OF BLUE ALL THE TIME. I even started to hit my hands/arms every time I have a thought like this so this can stop, but I got to the point I started to get bruises, and sometimes my hands and arms are really sore.I really wish I could go back in time when I didn't know this was a thing.I am not saying this is this person fault. Please do not say anything bad about her, she is perfect. But the truth is the things she said and things that happened were triggers that led me to get to know blue and all this happened.";I have A LOT of problems since always.

1c4nm9o;i’m so embarrassed i want to kill myself;gwennnnnnnd;I was waking home from school and tripped pretty bad I scuffed up my knee and hand and it was right in front of a group of girls who don’t like me, they asked if i was okay whilst obviously sniggering to their mates about it and i sat up and said i’m ok and ran off as fast as possible but I’m so embarrassed I hate myself so much. I usually stay pretty under the radar from literally everyone but i’m so embarrassed and they weren’t the only people who saw loads of people did. I get embarrassed so easily  but this has to be the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to me. As soon as I got home I cried to my step dad and my mum about how embarrassed I was i literally started having a panic attack. God I hate everything so much.Edit: Thanks for everyone being so kind lol😭 I know this seems like a massive overreaction but I have anxiety and have been bullied at school for as long as I remember so yeah maybe it’s only something small like tripping up but that to me is the end of the world, I immediately think the worst and end up having a panic attack, I do it with literally everything sometimes even coughing. Also ppl telling me to suck it up it’s also kinda helpful bc it makes me feel better knowing that it’s rlly not that deep.

1c4n02o;I don’t know what to do with myself anymore;OkArm4380;I want to just be free, but I can’t. I don’t want my family to see my lifeless body, my family has gone through a lot of losses, it really hit them hard. Seeing my cousin so devastated at my grandpa’s passing, I just can’t put him through it again. My parents work hard they’ve been nothing but kind, they try very hard, there’s some misses but they mean well, they’re amazing. Tbh I don’t think I should even feel this way when my life has been fine, But I just lose motivation. I “tried” to kill myself, but I knew it would fail. I tried in a high failure attempt of suicide like strangling my self, suffocating myself with a pillow. I was well aware I couldn’t do it, I knew my body would automatically react on its own even if I tried, cause I was scared , scared to die, but mostly scared at what me dying will do to everyone I love.I gave so much of myself to someone just for my feelings to be tossed around and trashed like it didn’t matter, I made the first mistake, I was so stupid, dense, and ignorant, I’ve hurt them accidentally but I was willing to change and learn, so why did you have to be like that. I’ve exhausted my self, and I’m the only one keeping me together, I’m the therapist of myself that gets to hear every one of my problems, but now there’s barely none. I can’t even be a friend to my friends, I wouldn’t say I’m mean, I’m just there but not really. I won’t go too much into detail about why I feel like this, I’m sorry. I don’t even know what I want with doing this post, I’m just so lost. I had thoughts before, but never trying, even if it’s obviously bad attempts. maybe sometime sooner or later my “attempts” may get worseI know eventually it’ll all be fine, but dying seems so comforting, but suffocating at the same time.;I want to just be free, but I can’t.

1c4msay;Post breakup and I can’t live like this. ;Scrappy-Wolf;I’m open and trusting I always get used by the girl I date….everyone in my life that supposedly loved me. Just wasted my time. I honestly would rather she had just killed me. Back story is that this girl was friends with my gf before her that passed away in 22. We became close and she was extremely supportive during the time following. I fell for her but she had fallen for me long before but because ofp trauma from losing my gf and from being used poop oh I  lolby every woman I’ve dated who would promise the world and then stab me in the back. I’m very cautious and yet for her sake I opefned up faster than I should have probably. She was attached. I was attached. She’s gone through so much this year and our relationship has kind of been a roller coaster but I truly believed we’d make it through. Saturday I got mad because when we started dating we set ground rules…like the very obvious “don’t hang out alone with members of the opposite sex” in my experience that’s where trouble starts well…she hung out with her ex husband and then told me afteghsr like it was no big deal. She said he just came to look at her car that was messing up (something I’d already done twice) and I told her I wasn’t cool with that and it went against what we’d agreed on and she just said “well. Sorry you feel that way but you don’t control me. I can do what I want”. Never said she couldn’t but it was a huge slap in my face. Then I deactivated my Facebook  because that was a source of our arguments. Thought I’d may better if she just had that privacy. But she instead actxjbvrcused me of playing games (I’m not sure to what end any of that would’ve accomplished) and blocked me from everything and said she was done. After all I’ve done for her…why this? I’ve shown her how much I love her and respect her. I she also swings back and forth in a pendulum of being rude and hateful to being sweet and loving. I would do anything for her. The one person who has truly loved me these last two years…now I can’t sleep because of the nightmares. I wake, scream, cry, and vomit. She saved my life and I just wanted to do that for her. But I don’t want to live without her. I can’t. Why does everyone always promise they would never do anything like this…right before they do it. I haven’t since Saturday…even then it wasn’t much. I’ve just given up on life. I can’t eat until I manage to talk to her.

I didn't wanna die such a painful and traumatising death, but as I've tried everything possible to kms, this is my last resort. I think if I get sent to a mental facility (if this doesn't work) I'll just become more suicidal since I don't really think the employees in the mental facilities in my country are very kind (as reported by many ppl). But if I dont get sent to the mental facility, I'm straight up just gonna jump, no matter how much of a pussy I am. If I want peace, I gotta make some sacrifices. Ig I'm not meant to die a painless death, I've learnt to accept it. I hope atleast on the other side, I'm finally able to be in peace, without any form of pain, physically nor mentally.

1c4ldze;I WOULDNT CARE IF I DIED ;Nick-Gerr23;Does anyone else feel like there is no point to life but fully living it at the same time? Yes, life has gotten bad for me in these past few days like drastic changes. As a kid I was aware that I was living life but things just feel like a simulation like a video game that I can’t wake up from. My life feels like the Sims, best way I can explain it. I don’t feel like I’m in control of my actions because I do things that I know are wrong specifically cheating on my ex. I don’t wanna cheat but I did it anyway knowing how it would make her feel. I’m a horrible person for this and I want her back so bad but if I get her back I still wouldn’t be able to have her forever just until one of us died. Then after that what is there? Your significant other carries memories of you and then they die, vice versa. But when both of you die who’s gonna remember the two of you after 50 years. Our influence over the world that we made when we where living fades away like we were never here to begin with. I don’t see a point to life, there’s never been a point to life. I have at least one thought of suicide everyday. I just picture scenarios that involve my death. I don’t think I wanna kill myself but I don’t know why I think about it. If I die then I die that’s it. I don’t fear death because im just thinking that it just means my time on this earth is no more. I’m going into the army hoping that it would help me change in a way who knows not like im gonna be special I’m still gonna be weakminded and pathetic. Luckily long after I’m dead I can rid any type of presence that I had on this earth.  Thanks for listening I just wanted to rant and get these feelings off my chest.;Does anyone else feel like there is no point to life but fully living it at the same time?

1c4ktnz;Looking for experiences on antidepressants / hormonal disbalans and being honest to surroundings about planning your 'exit' ;Sjwameel;Hey there. This is my first time reaching out on something like this. I've been depressed for some 3 or 4 years now and for the last 1,5 years having suicidal tendencies. To give some what of a background story, it all started 11 years ago when my dad took his own life. Took me 4 years to get back on my feet and in the process did a lot of courses about therapy / burn out recovery / trauma healing. A lot of people approached me after I got back up on how I did it and if I could guide them which started my journey as a therapist / healer and I've been helping a lot of people (they say) successfully since. But starting last year I couldn't do it anymore, seeing other people get happy-ish again with their lives while I felt myself sliding down again. So I gave up my practice and moved abroad left behind everything hoping to make a new start. Times have been tough financially, started my own business in entertainment industry and making some good money now but everything still feels shallow, hollow and meaningless. I've never opted for antidepressants cause my dad was on them and it didn't help him nothing so I'm kind of sceptical. The season of building festivals is almost starting which means I'll be working from May until September non stop having maybe 2 or 3 days off which is a crazy period but at least I'm busy and I'll make a shitload of money. But until now I haven't been able to enjoy any of it. My best friend who was one of the main reasons getting me on my feet after my dad died, died from an overdose a couple of years back and I just don't feel I have anything left to live for, there is nothing in my life that makes me want to get up in the morning. The only little boost I've had until now is that I've decided to end it after the season. Spend my money on a nice place, say my goodbyes and be done with it. If feels like a gigantic relieve and I almost can't wait to be done with it. Because of my mom who is already extremely damaged from my dad's suicide I am willing to give anything a chance until September / October cause I feel like I owe her. Next week I'm visiting my hometown in the Netherlands and I'm gonna be honest to her about my plans cause I don't want her to be surprised by this again. I can't imagine anybody taking the time to read until here but if you did thanks that you did. If you have any experience with antidepressants or what I'm suspecting I'm having is a shortage of testosterone or whatever substances. Any experience at all balancing this shit out again would be greatly appreciated. Also people making the same plans and being honest about it to your surroundings please share your experiences. PS I'm not looking for any cheer me up messages I have a lot of people and support but it doesn't get thru to me. Also I'm not feeling emotional or dramatic I'm sharing this in a very calm and objective mind.;Hey there. This is my first time reaching out on something like this.

Everything is hard work, everything needs extra planning, some days never end. And when they do I go to bed knowing the next day can be as unpredictable and scary as the previous.

I’ve told everyone I tripped over a wire and landed awkwardly and they know I bruise easily anyway and am clumsy, so everyone believes it. But it’s got to the point now where I might have to go to hospital because of how much pain I’m in and how bad it looks.  It’s been a week and my whole arm is still bad and I’m just terrified when I go there, they won’t believe my story of falling over and they’ll figure out it’s self inflicted.

I've always had low self esteem - I don't think I'm attractive or particularly likeable. I've sought validation in all the wrong ways that has resulted in a sex addiction that was a major contributor to one marriage ending and has pushed my current marriage to the brink. I didn't really love my first wife but I truly love my current wife. I feel like we were meant to be. I have ruined her life with the things I did in my addiction - the decisions I made to validate myself. She won't touch me anymore and I honestly don't think she loves me but she has stayed with me despite the fact we have no children together, nothing that really ties us to each other except that we fell in love. I betrayed her love and she is trying to cope in her own way but it has sank me into this deep depression that feels like will never get better. I almost texted the crisis line this morning but now I'm at work and around other people. I'm really scared tho - she works tonight and I'll be home alone. I hate my life.;I don't know if I am or not. I know people who have committed suicide.

1c4j23q;I'm writing my note;one_month_left;Throwaway for obvious reasonsI'm failing out of college, I'm too sick mentally and physically, to keep up, or to workI have to go back to my parents over the summer, and since I'm dropping out I'm going to end up stuck thereI can't live with that. They made my life hell for 17 years before I could leave. I won't, and don't want to survive if I have to spend even another year there. So, I'm making a plan and writing a note. One month left, until I'm back with them. I can't risk doing it here in the dorms, someone will find me too quick, and I couldn't let my friends be the ones to discover me.I hope they know it's not their fault. I hope my parents know it is their fault, maybe then they will be better for my siblings. One month left, but I need to talk about it somewhere, and I don't think anyone can convince me to change my mind.

1c4izka;There’s no purpose;Snowy8787;I have felt this way for most of my life, around maybe 4 or 5 years. I feel worthless and lonely. I am a disappointment to my parents. They have accomplished so much more when they were my age. I have accomplished nothing and it is because it’s my fault being too much of a coward to try new things. When they were my age they met each other, learnt to drive buy a car, buy a house etc. I will never admit this to them because I don’t want to seem weak which is what I am.I’ve always wanted a girlfriend but I don’t deserve one and she wouldn’t deserve me. If I was a girl I wouldn’t date myself. How could I love another person if I can’t even love myself. I have no qualifying boyfriend skills. All I want to do is go to work go home and hide in my room. Even if I somehow overcame this I was simply not meant to meet someone special, I am tremendously ugly and short. No girl would want to be with me why would they. I still crave for a relationship despite all this even though I know I shouldn’t. I just wish I could be hugged more, yes I know I’m pathetic.I don’t see any purpose in the future or how I could find any happiness from it. All the good times are in the past now. I will never see Nan again and my parents will never be together again. Anything that I used to find fun I don’t anymore. I don’t enjoy playing video games anymore, I am just playing them to have something to do until it is time to just go to sleep which is my best part of the day. I don’t find much enjoyment in the food I used to love. I find most of the time I just stress eat and find I’ve already just eaten something before I realised it. Even places like Burger King and McDonald’s, it just doesn’t taste the same anymore. It is a similar experience with films. When Is the next time I could watch and enjoy guardians of the galaxy at the cinema with my whole family still together, never so what’s the point on carrying on. I do think about if I never existed if my parents wouldn’t have to be ashamed of a pathetic failure excuse of a son.

I have had this feeling for a few years now, as I became an adult, and life became a little bit less fun.I have this painful feeling, like I have been done dirty. Like this is a mean joke played on me.I see other people. Many of them. Young too. They drive expensive cars, buy beautiful stuff and have no care about anything. I do not necessarily envy them, but when I look at myself compared to them, I feel so insignificant, despite all my intelligence and reasoning. I feel like I am lower than them, in a way.My family is not poor, but it is not rich either. I had no choice but to be born in it. My parents also have this unexplainable desire to not progress in life, this has hindered them a lot, and as much as I have tried to change that for the better, it did not change much. I feel like I have been given a bad and unfair start at life. I know other people may have that too, but this does not make it any more right.Sometimes, this feeling brings rage, but other times, the more intense ones, it brings deep sadness and I completely crash. It all seems so pointless to me. My life feels like it was made for me to lose and suffer for it. I try to fight it, and I try to work really really hard. But sometimes when I look up and I see how insignificant and useless the progress I am making is compared to what these people already have, I just want to die and make it all end.

1c4idzs;disappointment;Real_Accountant_2521;"I don't know why i'm posting this here, but i guess it's not something someone that will soon be gone should worry about.I've been struggling with this feeling of not belonging and incapability of understanding stuff that is simple to others.My family did always think i was gifted, just because i had good grades on highschool. But it was a public school, not too demanding. Of course, i still had to put a little effort into it to get the best possible grades. I lived really close to school, truly, just 4 minutes or so away.I've always known about the harsh reality of this world and the truth that things will not be ok and that we are doomed to basically be slaves the entirety of our existence after becoming adults, but still. I can't believe i am so different! No matter who i meet, no matter how much i try to interact with others, i just can't find anything in common with them! And in college... it's even worse! Everyone is so hardworking and smart, and i feel truly worthless, and to make it worse, i'm studying something i don't even like, and to get to college i need to travel 1 hour and 30 minutes or even 2 hours. I know this is supposed to be common, but i was so used to just... wake up and get to school and then rot in bed. Now i have to wake up at 4 am to get to a place i don't like to study at and study something i don't like or that i'm good at!And after all that ""rant"" i think that's the word for it... I realized ""Wow, i never truly had any aspirations, hopes, dreams or anything that made me special!"" I am so painfully average, then why? Why cannot i perform simple tasks? Socialize? I guess it's just the continuous years of just rotting in bed and playing videogames are finally coming back to me.To be honest, i don't even know where i want to get to with this post, i guess i just want to... leave my mark here?Well, in the end, that's it. I never had any aspirations, nothing that made me special, nothing to hope for in the future. I just... look at the mirror and see a stranger? I sometimes don't even recognize myself, i am truly despicable, and an eyesore, an imbecile who cuts himself to feel... something!Thankfully, i will put an end to it all today, i don't know what to expect from the other side. Hell? Reincarnation? Nothing? To be honest, i just want to rest, this fight is over for me. I wish i could have known how love felt at least once? A nice cuddly boyfriend would have been just perfect! But i guess in a country like this, my unstable psyche and unfortunate physical traits + the homophobia made such thing impossible! Anyways, sorry mom. You've gotten better as a person, but what you did to me back then is something my mind and body won't let me forget.Yeah, sorry for the ""long"" poorly written and barely coherent post.

1c4hxfo;Why can suicide be rational even if you aren't terminally ill?;Primary-Newt-3483;"Edit: Title should read ""can't"".Something that has always confused me is the idea that suicide is inherently bad unless you are terminally ill/in chronic pain.However, many mental health issues are chronic with no cure available. Say a personality disorder or bipolar.Now no-one would say that these conditions do not affect your quality of life. As someone who has experience mental pain (bipolar type II) and physical pain, I can tell you I'd take the physical pain every single day.That's not to discount anyone's experience of physical pain or their opinion to the contrary. That's not really my point.My point is that suicide is often considered a rational response to physical pain. Whereas for mental health issues it's always ""things will get better, think about other people etc.""Things won't get better. They have been getting worse and worse over the last decade (late 30s). No prospects, can't afford to live alone so will have to share with strangers (which is fantastic when you have bad anxiety), addiction issues to self-medicate etc.And think about other people? Why do people not think about those suffering? As the cheesy quote says ""if you love something, let it go"". I want to be able to sit down and have a rational conversation with my friends and family. No-one says you are selfish for wanting to leave a party early because you are having a terrible time. But wanting to leave this plane of existence is seen as completely selfish.Well life is a party we all have to leave eventually. I'm just hating the party and want to go home early. Everyone else will join me at some point so what's a few years in the grand scheme of things?I don't want my friends and family to think it's their fault, but I can't do that without having a rational conversation with them. Which the stigma of suicide for mental health issues makes impossible.Rant over I guess. I'm just done. Sometimes it doesn't get better and that's just life. At least I have pushed my friends/family away enough to ease some of their pain when I take the plunge so to speak. I just wish it could be on my terms and not society's.";"Edit: Title should read ""can't"".Something that has always confused me is the idea that suicide is in";;5;6;2024-04-15 09:27:25;2024-04-15;Monday;09:27:25;2117;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 21:05:34.139161
1c4hrw8;I’m just tired. Straight exhausted.;iamanobody22;This isn’t an urgent post or anything. i don’t have any ongoing plans like “i’m gonna do it on this day, at this time.” I’m just having these thoughts for like the bajillion time and at some point my dam’s gonna crack. I’ve dealt with depression since I was 16 (realistically started by 14 but I didn’t recognize/understand it yet) and I’m currently 23 now. I know depression isn’t something that truly goes away. You hopefully just learn to deal with it better. The worst spikes I’ve had was at 17, 18, 19, and 21. At all of those points, there were countless instances of me saying fuck it and going through with it, but I always managed to stop myself. After a full year of working on myself, and getting to a point where things didn’t feel numb and actually felt like what I assume people aren’t depressed feel like (aka “nOrMal”). But after all of that, boom. All hot ass. From 22-present I’ve been sad. I used to think I was so numb to even shed a tear these days. Boy, I was wrong. I cry every night now.So, even though this thought of kms-ing has been in my head for well over 8 years now, I’m thinking I might actually do it this time. Although my thought-process/emotions are completely different this time. All the other times in the past, I felt like I was going crazy, like the 2 halves of me were in a constant fight to live or die. Each time I was on the tipping point. Yet this time, I’m just over it. And not in the sense like I’m super depressed and tired of living. Mmm I don’t know how to express this properly…it’s just different this time. Like instead of thinking “I’m tired of living (with sobbing regret and pleading for a sign).” It’s more like “I’m tired of living, not only is everything numb, but the concept as a whole just seems boring and not worth.” I’m passed the point of being tired of depression, I’m simply bored of being depressed. I’m bored of life. Again it’s different this time. Like I’ve felt empty so many times before, this isn’t that. There is something there, something to life, it’s just meaningless rather than empty. Perhaps it’s time to log off. If I end up, well, ending it all, I feel like my expression through it all is gonna be so nonchalant. (Also I’m down to reply to people with questions about anything really, if that’s even something people do here. Idk I’ve never really use reddit before.);This isn’t an urgent post or anything. i don’t have any ongoing plans like “i’m gonna do it on this ;;0;4;2024-04-15 09:17:03;2024-04-15;Monday;09:17:03;2354;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 21:05:34.140585

Nothing incredibly special, but I have a wonderful partner who supports me, and I’m surrounded by family and friends. I even have a good academic and social career. In the past I struggled with SH and multiple attempts, not for any particular reason. (Moreso because I just.. didn’t see a point to anything. I didn’t feel satisfaction or any incredible drive to live despite all these good things. It felt like I was doing everything for no reason, really. I guess it’s more a question of what my purpose is?)I don’t think anything has triggered these thoughts recently, but I notice them in the background a lot. Nothing about my life is miserable, but they’re still there. I even took up going to the gym and journaling. I’ve never tried medication or therapy, and I’m wondering if it actually works?

I don’t feel “happy” and “sad”, sometimes I feel things close to them, but not them, and sometimes I feel things utterly different. my mind is so confusing. I don’t understand it. I don’t get it. It’s just like static and fire in there, at least the best as I can describe it. sometimes it burns brighter or louder. I’m drawn to edges, to cars. My scars are too small. My brain hurts. I just don’t understand this anymore. I can’t even describe it properly. It’s like there’s a world in there sometimes that I can walk around in, and sometimes people but sometimes not, and if I walk around in there for too long, or if I go to the ice lake, I might come across a creature. It feels like there’s a galaxy in there but only sometimes. I’m constantly bombarded by ideas and sensations and sights I don’t understand. I see things sometimes. Or hear things. Or think silly, abstract, paranoid things. I think things that I know are so far fetched. And yet. I’m just confused. My mind hurts. This is getting worse. A few weeks ago I wasn’t getting out of bed. Two days ago I went to the hairdresser and she said “are you one of those long haired people that only wash their hair once a month?” And proceeded to brush my hair so rough and make so much noise I overstimulated and ran out of there sobbing.

1c4g1ea;Suicide is the only option if things don't work out by the next month ;Nice-Dirt-link;I (24 f) have had a fairly successful life in the past but it all came at a huge cost everytime. Starting from school, I had a very difficult time at home as my parents have been very strict and loved me conditionally. Never opened up, got threatened to be kicked out if I didn't do well at school, never praised. Hence I developed self confidence issues and I never think I'm good enough. When I was trying to get into a good college, there was a time frame of two months when nothing was clear about the near future and my parents lost it. I got into a good college but life was mediocre, I had no freedom from home, was not pretty looking so didn't get attention and people weren't nice to me, couldn't discover my passions early on, did not establish an amazing name, struggled with placements, took me much longer to find the job which suited me compared to rest. Eventually, I was happy as I ended up with an okay job. The job nature was not which made me passionate hence I was preparing for post graduate exams. Post one year, I lost my job, however decided to switch to a better place. I got a very good offer and an acceptance from a ok to bad post graduate college. However the job delayed the joining and I had to join the college. I was doing very well in the college and I ended up with multiple internship offers including the best one. I was very successful and performed better than almost all my peers however didn't get the expected results in terms of not getting a full time offer. I was devastated as it was my dream. Placements shook me, nothing matched my profile and the pays were equal to my previous MBA salary hence making my MBA degree absolutely futile. Today I have used up all my earnings to pursue this MBA degree and I don't have a job. All years of my hard work since my childhood have been wasted and I've nothing left. I've used up all my resources, done everything I can to get out of this situation. I feel alone at home, suffocated, hated and ridiculed at now. No money in my pocket, can't go out anywhere, suffocated at home. Now I feel like dying is my only option as these patterns of failures have always repeated in life no matter what I do however hard I work, however smart I work, by any way. If everything in life is pre-decided why do I even try anymore. I can't live more years in my life like this anymore, dying seems easier.

I’m sorry, Dear. That I will leave this world and won’t be here anymore to comfort you. I’ll be turning 20 this year- I get a little goosebumps thinking about it. What if I regret it? Probably won’t considering my brain will be in shreds. I turned out to be a real piece of shit and the world treated me like it- life is so dull, joy stripped away from my being. Cats are my only real escape from reality, their silly little guys- I’ll miss the two strays I’ve been taking care of, I’ll never get to see them grow and be more silly. They’ll forget about me eventually and just be silly by themselves without a care in the world what am I saying, I’m scared, I’m so scared that my life will fade in instant and I will miss everything- I’m so scared at the thought of death and I’m just so fucking scared I don’t want to do it but I have to, this misery is killing me, I just want it to be over- I want this loneliness and this stupid fucking voice in my head to leave me alone reminding me of how worthless I fucking am. I don’t want to die, but I will, I have to. Otherwise I’ll just exist, no emotions, no feeling, no soul, stripped away of being human. When I get like this I think about my partner and the little strays- they’re so cute, they’re so little since they didn’t eat much but they’re growing slowly as I feed them. They’re mean to each other and the fluffy one is the bully but they still love each other. They bask in the sun without a care in the world, once I’m gone they’ll be there waiting for a little treat and some food and protection from evil people and I won’t be there another snnni just can’t n fucking continue anymore fucki I’m sorry I’m sorry I just please, someone promise me they’ll be safe, please?;I am a dead man walking, since 16 I had planned my demise on my 21st birthday.

1c4fdg8;I feel so stupid ;Scatchhate;I’m 22(F) and I don’t feel like my life is going anywhere. I finally left my mom’s house to be on my own with my boyfriend cause my home life was very verbally abusive. I couldn’t handle it anymore. He got kicked out of his mom’s house for the same reason. We met in a mental health hospital and instantly clicked over our stories. And for once, I felt loved and understood. We lived with some roommates for about 2 months before we got into an argument and they called the cops on him. I tried to explain the situation and how it was just a disagreement and he doesn’t know how to express himself properly. (I know, I know… it sounds bad. But it genuinely was just a bad argument about a pregnancy scare we had and he kinda freaked out cause we weren’t financially ready for a kid and we yelled at each other) when the cops took him, it was because he said some pretty scary stuff about hurting himself. They took him to a hospital and we were apart for 3 days. Those were the worst days of my life. My roommate and so called friend convinced me I needed a rebound and drove me to a guys house she found on Tinder. I didn’t know this guy had a roommate there and they both took advantage of me. When I tried telling my friend, she downplayed it. Made me feel crazy and like I was just a whore... I still wake up at 4 AM with nightmares. When my boyfriend and I finally got together again, we decided “fuck it” and left the city. We bounced around from a while, but now we’re both couch surfing with the other side of my family. We put in effort to find jobs and make money however we can. He got a job at a fast food restaurant and I got a job at a convenience store. We both have trauma and deal with our own demons but we have each other. However, lately I’ve been feeling more hopeless and useless. Like I deserved what happened to me and I asked for It. I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend about it. But he just gets upset and as much as he wants to listen, he feels helpless and gets frustrated he wasn’t there. He blames himself, which in turns makes me blame myself for even speaking about it. He doesn’t mean to, and he encourages me to open up. It’s just hard. I have no money, I’m practically homeless. I wanna lean on him but I’m scared I’ll lean too much or ask for too much and he’ll leave. He’s scared for me, and I’m scared too. I hate this feeling. I feel numb. I feel empty. I just don’t wanna be here anymore. I don’t wanna do this anymore.;I’m 22(F) and I don’t feel like my life is going anywhere.

I even got acception into university, my dad sees this as hope that i can live a normal life, but i know ill never be normal nor will i ever come close.  im really socially inept i hide behind my dad whenever he forces me to go anywhere i cannot look at people in the eyes, i got multiple warnings when i had a job at a bakery because of my social skills being unprofessional (ecven though i displayed bad social skills at the interview and disclosed my struggle) until i eventually quit because i am so scared That it made me want to kill myself every night i got homei take antipsychotic because i used to Typically hear voices daily telling me im worthless, to die, i know its not real but i used to ask for signs to do it and would receive them from the universe, like coloured cars and specific animals somehow would always appear, even when i did not go outside That day, at the one second id glance outside id see the sign i ask for. this is not daily anymore and only when im extremely sad nowanyway...Ive tried to kill myself many tjmes since i Was 15 years old.  All of them have been related to some fear and i always believe the universe put me on this earth to kill myself so it gave me this mental illness, gave me the abuse by my mom (left 3 years ago) growing up, gave me the bullying, i always try to die because im terrified always, the first time i did at 15 it actually because i liked a guy for the first time, he told me i was weird and odd and that he would not like someone who acts like me. i knew then i was too different to ever fit in with the rest of them.  that was one of the rare instances i tried to get over the un-comfortability i have and try to befriend someone in person.im about to be an adult and cant look anybody in the face, im about to be an adult and the extent of social interaction ive had exists on-line.

1c4eu1r;I'm in a house with an abusive father with nowhere to go currently;MannydogSolaire;"Hello, I really feel like I'm at the end of my string as I am typing this. My father has currently taken my phone away threatening to wipe it, and this is my only way to communicate at the current moment if he goes through with it.My father over the course of 2 days has had a mental breakdown over basically nothing. He has had breakdowns like these before, but this one has struck a particularly bad point. Over 2 years ago my father had a similar breakdown that involved him smashing several things that belonged to my mom and it got to the point where he pointed a shotgun in her face. It was empty, but he was threatening to shoot her and who knows if he could've gotten a shell or not. It ended with me calling the police and him being sent to jail, which is not what I wanted to happen. I wanted him to get help, but it just ended up making things worse. The day after he came back wanting to kick me out of the house, of which I stayed at a friend's house for the time being and my mom went back to our house. My dad was also an awful alcoholic and would regularly berate me and my mom while he was drunk.While she was there, she told me he had chased her around with a knife and he had ended up punching her in the face and making her lip bleed, which then she left again to come back to the friend's house. The next night he had lit a fire in the house that could've burnt the house down and kill him, but thankfully the sprinklers we had turned on. After that whole thing I spent a lot of time away from him and not talking to him. at a later point we decided to get back together as me and my mom had nowhere to go since listings in California are awful.He hadn't really had any major outbursts for a while until last year where he started to get increasingly more and more angry. Some could go on for a while. Since he was afraid of actually doing something that could get him arrested, he wouldn't touch us in fear I would call the police on him. So he uses that night I had called the police on him as fuel to be verbally and psychologically abusive to me and my mom.He has on multiple accounts told me that ""I'm not your dad"" or ""You're not my son"" to me when he gets in these tantrums I'll say. He has said stuff to my mom about cheating on him, that she isn't seeking help for her mental problems, saying things about how he's glad her dad died and that her mom is a terrible mother, and just overall going after family members that he think wronged him.So I'll just get to the one from recently, My dad has had an extreme mental breakdown over quite literally nothing. It started with just my mom before he, for literally no reason, got me involved. I did nothing to him at all and he decided to call me saying that if I don't pack anything before they came home, he would kick me out. And if I refused he would call the police on me to get me arrested. He has done this before recently about 2 months ago and he actually tried to do it. He again used the same I'm not his son and he's not my dad as mentioned before.eventually my mom and I left and spent time at the mall as he wanted us to go away. While we were gone, he again started drinking, something he knows he's not supposed to do and has done before again to hurt both of us. When we came back, he was drunk and basically the rest of the night he berated my mom while I went to go sleep. The first few hours of the next day weren't completely awful, as my dad was passed out asleep and my mom was going to go grocery shopping. But it all changed instantly because he woke up screaming my mom's name.I stepped out of my room to tell him she was grocery shopping, and when he saw me, he still went on about how I'm not supposed to be here and I'm not welcomed in ""his house"". So my mom had to come back home again because of the fact he didn't want her out. So me and my mom went out again and I had a complete mental breakdown. I was crying hard and I felt completely hopeless. My mom called up my nanny(her mom) and told her about everything that had happened and the possibility of moving to Virginia. She reassured me everything was okay and that I am stronger than I think I am.But I don't feel that way. I feel completely hopeless, depressed, stressed and sick. My stomach is bothering me, my head is starting to bother me, my body feels weak and I feel like I'm going to vomit. I'm 19 and I don't know what to do. I don't have a job, can't drive and am going to college. I feel like suicide is my only way out as I can't wait anymore for this shit to stop. I'm completely at the end of my string and can only find that as a solution. My dad has said so many hurtful things to me and my mom that I can't even list all of it. I don't know if I can wait that time to move to Virginia and I don't know if I can handle divorce. I feel like I'm running out of time with limited options.

1c4ekm2;workaholic parents + Suicidal Burnout;RosePetalsAnd_Thorns;"Does anyone else suffer from a dysfunctional family that centers around money, working alot and forced toxic positivey about doing stuff everyday to ""improve your life""?He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flaresI know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.Anyways that's my rant. Does anyone have similar parents? What have you done in terms of burnout and ocd? I take supplements Like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, gaba, magnesium bisglycinate, and 5-http.I have read a bit of atomic habits and the daily stoic 366 meditations by Ryan Holiday. Please any advice would be helpful. Thanks and have a good dayTdlr: parents work hard and push themselves. They place thar burden onto me and I got burnt out. Haven't recovered and their pissed.

I don’t want to die before I’ve achieved anything. I’m so fucking pathetic, I’m so far behind all of my peers. I don’t want to die and have everyone remember me as this pathetic thing I am. I don’t want to die until I at least have my shit in order, so that it’s easy for my family to get rid of all my stuff and so i have enough money for my own funeral costs because I’m already enough of a fucking burden as it stands. I can’t die yet. I know that.But I also don’t know how to keep living like this. I don’t know how to feel this much despair all the time, and keep functioning. i don’t know how to keep up appearances, and pretend im not fucking drowning when I see my friends. I’m so alone in this. I don’t know how to talk to anybody in real life about this. I’m floundering on my own with no support, no access to treatment, and no way out.My self harming is getting worse. I feel like it’s the only way to occupy the space in between living and dying. the pain is tangible and numbs my mind out for a little bit. Getting drunk helps too but my dad’s an alcoholic and is part of the reason my life’s falling to pieces right now. I refuse to become him. I used to eat a lot to cope but I can’t afford to anymore. there’s barely food in the house now. i used to do art to cope, but can’t bring myself to do it anymore. doesn’t help anyway. not really.I’ve always known I’d die by suicide, unless some random accident or disease out of my control took me out before i got the chance.

The failsafe being a stash of medication to keep under my bed for when the time comes. I won't do it soon, but there's no way I'm making it to old age. Not if I have to struggle with this the rest of my life, I can't handle it for much longer. For now, I'll do what I can. Learn what I wanna learn, paint what I wanna paint, jump on my mini trampoline because it makes me happy, but there's gonna come a time where I've run out of these things. The busy work. There's only so much distracting I can do. One day, I imagine laying down, turning my phone off and taking the pills before bed. I won't wake up and I will finally be free. I don't even want to do it, I don't want to die but it really feels like the lesser of two evils :(.;After realizing lately that the main issue that I've struggled with my entire life will never go awa;;0;2;2024-04-15 05:23:10;2024-04-15;Monday;05:23:10;1164;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 15:19:05.330553

1c4e4xy;I just need to get this off my chest;98542643;"It's been almost 6 months since my ex committed suicide and I can't get over the insurmountable guilt and pain I feel for him. I long for him every day. I loved him so much and would've done absolutely anything for him, but when he needed me the most, I failed him. To summarize it as quick as possible, my ex had a really rough childhood and he was adopted by an American family who ended up homeschooling him. He later joined the military but had no friends when I met him. We had a decent 4 month relationship but I never really felt ""loved"" by him. Now looking back, maybe he had RAD that made it hard for him to communicate/express his feelings. One time, during one of our breakup/makeups (we were officially back together), I found out he tried to cheat on me and I was completely devastated and broke it off. But I couldn't last a month without him so I ended up texting him back, meeting him and implying that I want to get back together. He didn't want to. During the 2 months after our break up, I met him several times, tried to get him to go out and experience the world a little. He was always so sheltered and such a homebody... but he rejected all my attempts. He made multiple, now in hindsight, textbook remarks of being suicidal but I didn't understand and I ignored them. I knew he was depressed but I couldn't understand that he could be more depressed than me given that I was the one who was cheated on. Idk if it's because suicide was such an alien subject to me, kinda like war, that I never imagined someone close to me would be in that volatile of a state. I knew he was depressed, yet I only asked him once, maybe twice, why (which he refused to answer). I'm such a fucking coldhearted piece of shit. Until this, I thought I was a decent human being who was relatively kind. But now.... I don't even feel human. I feel like I'm a danger to the people around me. This is very hastily written but I guess my bottom line is that I used to be hopeful for the future. I have a great family who would do anything for me, I have a great job, I'm not bad looking... on paper I have a lot going on for myself. In the past, I wasn't always happy or optimistic (and in fact, I was probably pretty pessimistic), but I never once even thought of suicide as a solution. It was such a far-fetched concept to me. But I just feel so drained with this pain that I carry inside now... not only do I feel obligated to personally understand the indescribable pain my ex went through, I don't feel deserving of happiness, and quite frankly, my mindset of life and the world completely switched and I've lost all hope. I don't wish to feel better. My family keeps telling me they love me and asking if I'm feeling suicidal and all I can think to myself is that I know they love me, and I'm sorry but that's not enough... and of course, I can't tell them that I do feel suicidal. So here I am... I'm not actively suicidal at this time so no need for concern. Just tell me that I'm heartless, that I'm scum, that I have blood on my hands. That I'm the worst type of shit to walk this earth.... the type that pretends to be good and nice but is actually selfish and uncaring and coldhearted.

I struggle with depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, a recovering alcoholic that has been struggling generally really badly since July of 2021.  I don’t have any friends, he was all I had. I’ve been temporarily homeless and been hospitalised multiple times through our relationship and got hooked on alcohol and was able to get though it all with him by my side. I currently have no housing and is staying at his house and going to be sleeping on my brother in laws couch after (well that was the plan).

I had consumed a large amount of sleeping pills. By the second night stay I could hear the staff outside my room making comments about how they could kill me if I really wanted to die. putting different drugs in my iv and having me chock on a quarter.  the Dr even walked by and said I was basically brain rot in front of my room.  They purposely decreased my room temperature and laughed about it. Because i was in the room shivering. They whould walk by my room every 10 min, purposely making noises loud noises.  Then come check my blood pressure to make sure they were causing it to go up. Then laugh about it. The i heard one say that could bolus me with a lot of fluid and cause heart failure. I felt like the hospital staff was torturing me. This one nurse put on a Hoodie and stood right by my door, it said DIE LIVING. The hospital caused me ptsd. I was so terrified and scared of what the staff could do to me, and of course sorry for me being there in the first place.

He is old but probably has a couple more years left. I almost resent him for making me stay here. If I go through with my plan now no one will care for him as I do, no one will comfort him at night. He will miss me greatly, so I have no choice but to stay. I often think of the hunter-gatherer burial with the man curled up with his beast, lying side by side for all of time.

1c4d0rp;Crps (Suicide Disease);BlazeinBoiii;Going to rant a little, I just turned 24 (male) but I feel like I have the body of a 90 year old, I have rare chronic pain disorder affecting my entire body called crps, crps is medically the worst pain known to medicine hence the nickname suicide disease, I have been dealing with this for 2 years now after a foot surgery and since it has slowly spread to my entire body. I am constantly in pain and have random pain attacks where my pain will increase and my entire body will swell. I am losing full function of my legs and hands as well. My mental health is completely killed and I do not get pleasure from ANYTHING anymore. Things that shouldn't hurt hurt me like a blanket being pulled off me in the night or my gf touching me. The littlest things like a change in the weather will completely set me off or even someone raising there voice at me. I am so numb and emotionless to everything now. The only time I am happy is when I sleep because I don't have to feel anything.I have loving gf who have been with for 6 years since high-school. Funny thing is to we just bought our first house before Christmas of last year, my life is truly just starting and yet here I am wanting to end it. I have no money whatsoever currently and have been paying my bills with credit. I can not work and have just applied for disability benefits but doubt that will go anywhere as I see people taking 5+ years to get approval. We just got a puppy to try and bring some happiness into our lives as well a month ago. We also have 4 cats which we have had for a few years. My gf also can not work as she has epilepsy and extreme social anxiety, I used to be able to take care of everyone but now I can't even take care of myself. I don't know what she would do if I commit but she deserves a life.There is no cure for this disease just ketamine treatments and nerve pain medications, I had 1 small iv ketamine infusion 2 months ago and it didn't do much, I am doing 10 days of high dose infusions with 2 weeks so hopefully that does something but then again my mental state is completely killed and I don't know if I can gather the energy to live a normal life again after dealing with this condition for almost 2 years now. And most people need ketamine treatments for there entire lives with this condition, also something I do not want to do or can afford.;Going to rant a little, I just turned 24 (male) but I feel like I have the body of a 90 year old, I ;;0;1;2024-04-15 04:05:43;2024-04-15;Monday;04:05:43;2346;Reddit;suicidewatch;SuicideWatch;2024-04-17 15:19:05.365152

I dunno... powerful enough to withstand my story, so I figured the subreddit where people announce their own deaths should withstand it well enough, consider this a warning, my story is about as fucked up as it gets, beyond children in chains covered in shit, beyond people getting gutted like pigs, I'm talking about the most vile, the most inhuman side of humanity in existence, if I could trade knowing this with getting stuck in a gas chamber surrounded by jews I wouldn't hesitate, so yeah, you've been warnedI don't really know where to start... theirs many things I accredit for, well, you'll see, so I'll start where I ended.I was on a discord server called the ""insane asylum"", there I did my usual shitposting, went on like this for a few weeks, made some... looking back on it really fucked up friends when I saw an invite for a ""marathon"", I don't remember the exact wording but they described it as a series of progressively more fucked up scenes... you see where this is going, the first video I believe showed a street cam of a guy passing a bus in the city, he lost his balance, fell and his head got popped under the busses tire, his brain matter flew across the street just in front of an old lady with a cane. The next video showed 2 workers in some kind of machine, about 30 fps, completely silent, after a few seconds one of the workers vanished, replaced with a barely visible puft of steam, the third video was my only form of warning... one I still deeply regret ignoring, an where I qill remin you you can stop reading this, you heard the descriptions of the last two videos, you know this will only get worse, don't make the mistake I did, turn back, forget about me, whatever mental gymnastics you need to do to hide yourself from this hell is far, far better than knowing the truth, please... okay, you signed up for this, the hard video showed a naked woman strapped to a gurney, the camera was positioned and level with her vagina, which was tilted because she was attempting to roll on her side, I don't remember if the video played any audio, but I believe I heard her muffled cries, after a few seconds a gloved hand comes into frame, holding a pistol, the figure places the barrel of the firearm into her vagina, she makes a dulled crying noise, and they pull the trigger, her scream muffled to a dulled whimper, and the fourth video, the fourth video is what made me what I am now, what I go to bed each night thinking about, why I'm posting this on the suicide subreddit, and why I pray you won't follow in my footsteps,I have spent many, many years thinking about this 12 second video, I've replayed the memory so many times I'm convinced I've gone insane, I remember every detail, the cracks in the sidewalk, the sheen of the blade, the jadiz eyes of the victim, so I beg, one more time, to leave this post, leave and never return, I don't care what you've told yourself, ""oh their just being dramatic, how bad can it be?"" This is your final warning, after this my life will be splayed like the guts of those children, you believe you could bear my weight? Then go right ahead.The fourth video starts with showing a blackish white male with black, curly hair bound hands and feet with rope, and gagged, it's dark out, approximately 2 am, the only light from the phone one of the bastarts used to film the event, one other figure stand to the right of the camera operator, only visible is the tip of a machete, swaying with silenced excitement, the hogtied victim stares at the camera, their pupils impossibly tiny dots, fleeing from the phones flashlight, the figure with the machete steps behind the bound victim, and rearing his arm, brings the blade thru the man's neck, it glides halfway thru, severing his air channel and flooding his neck with blood, the man turns his head away from the camera, twisting his body in bound agony, it's dead quiet, the machete has since been removed from his neck, after 2 seconds a ""bluegh"" sound accompanied with a spurt of blood escaos the man's opened neck, the only sound heard before he slowly, thankfully dies, after he lays still, the figures approach his bleeding corpse, and that is when I finally managed to close the video, I could feel the machete burrowed in my neck, all I could see was his face, like a doe caught in a trap, seeing everything and nothing, as if he knew he was dead, for hours I sat on my head holding a pistol, recognizing what this could mean for my family, all the past events of my life rising in a blood curtling chorus, all the inexplicable things I've before seen online, the episode of ""fuck marry kill"" I saw on youtube, the liveleak videos all across the web, the various horrific displays of barbarianism all across this place, it all made sense, and that day I still regret not pulling that damn trigger, all this could've been avoided, the thousands of hours begging myself to keep going, that someday I would know peace, some day, somehow, I would be free.I now know that Is a lie, a fabrication my caveman brain made because instinct demanded it, that just because I was fuckes up did mean my reproductive buts weren't, if I wanted to make use of myself it would be to bring more innocent souls into this world, but knowing the fate of those innocent souls...I just can't...A decent while ago I met my would-be lover, they were... impossible, they somehow managed to dull the feverish desires that since plagued my mind, to such a degree she made me feel... safe... I knew it wouldn't last, even with all the hardship they endured they could never match the hell I know of, they left me, and with it the only sense of peace I've ever known... I don't know how I survived, the thoughts... i was beginning to tear down the dam I used to keep myself contained, to function well enough to be kept out of an asylum, board by board, nail by nail, stone by stone, then they left, and my brittle dam was smashed almost instantly, all the trauma came flooding back with a vengeance I never thought possible, I could feel the blade logged in my neck, the bullet jammed into my spine, my guys swaying in the wind, every agonizing second promised nothing but more pain and death and fear, days and days and days have since passed, I still feel the blade in my neck, it's since dulled down, now a more precise and loose pain in the very center of my neck, as if it begs for the sweet release of death, to be put down like the monster I've grown to be, my heart also aches, whenever I think of a blade it grows painful, at times I can't tell if it wants me to keep going or to drive a blade thru its twisting strands of muscle.My story doesn't end yet though, the worst is yet to come, you've been warned we'll enough, here you goAfter surviving the video I mentioned previously and pieced everything together there was only one conclusion I could draw, the urban legend, the website no one can speak of, the dark web, was real, this was reinforced deeply by the video games ""welcome to the game"" 1 and 2, both involving digging thru the deep web to find parts of a url link that will take you to a red room where a woman is being held captive before days and days of torture leading to her indescribably painful death, all while being watched by hundreds of eyes, all desperate for more. You see where this is going, after I played the games my brain started to force thoughts into my head, seeing my family become the victims of those vicious freaks,for years now they plague my thoughts, even now I see them gutted, their flesh served to the highest bidder, all that remains is the unwanted bones and viscera, left to dogs in the alleyways. I will spare you the details, mainly because I refuse to put them to paper, and now where the ""living infohazard"" thing comes into play, since my discovery of the dark web one of the most prevalent thoughts I've had is me being responsible for someone else becoming a victim, so I never spoke of it, I've spent the last 10 years suffering in as much silence as I could muster, every second of misery hidden from those I love, those I care for, and I know what happens to those who speak of them, I heard a story of a brother who got into the dark web during college thanks to a fellow peer, the friend told him to never press a button, don't remember the specifics, so rhe brother, after a few weeks, does press it, and sees a red room mid stream, it's too much, he uses the chat to scream at the other viewers that they are monsters, again, the details are foggy, the other viewers seem to enjoy the brothers misery, and track him down. After a but they hack into the laptop he used to use the web, activate his laptops camera remotely, and show a livestream of the insides of a closet, only the slats in the doors illumated from the inside of the room, the closet door opens, releasing the camera operator is in full black attire and weilding a screwdriver, a child is sat opposite of the closet, wearing headphones and playing video-game, the man slowly approaches the child, and, revealing the recording devices is not handheld, grabs the child by the mouth, yanking the chair back to reveal his face, it is then revealed the child is the brothers brother, the details are never specified, the man presses the screwdriver against the child's heart, and slowly drives it in, the small child stands no hope of escape against the man, and slowly, the screwdriver peirces his heart. This is where the post ends, and with it, is where I will end this trauma dump. I do not know why I feel the need to type all this out, considering it contradicts years of trauma, but I suppose I've finally broken, maybe this will be the end of my life, met with a round to the heart, so I may finally escape this hell, or maybe you all could help me thru this, in some fashion, you've likely talked suicidal people away from the pills so maybe tour magic could work here, or your just as desperate as I am and believed this post would bring some reprieve from your traumatized lives, either way, that's my story.";I don't know why or where to post this, the various r/ trauma or deep sibreddits didnt seem...

1c4cmyg;I struggle to see the value of living. I am afraid that I will kill myself when this goes unchecked.;Responsible-Dot-3801;"I truly don't see the value of being alive anymore. Nothing in my life feels fulfilling or worthwhile. I enjoy the time with my daughter and wife. I enjoy playing video games. I enjoy helping other people and make their lives better. But truly, none of these reasons can justify me being alive in this world.Externally, I just feel the world is such an unjust, horrible, place to live. Innocent people are murdered, raped, and incarcerated, while corrupt, evil people prosper, loved and celebrated as heroes. There is no place for good in this world, except for being taken advantage, manipulated and discarded in favor of those without morals.Internally, I feel that I am a useless piece of shit who don't deserve to live anyway. I just ended a business partnership, and right now I have to find clients on my own. Simply put, I am not doing well. Financially, I am still okay because of my savings (I am very frugal and I make sure my wife and daughter will be taken care of even without me), but looking to the future, it is bleak. At least, if I die, the my savings can be used for my wife and daughter to have a better life.  I tried discussing this feelings to two people that I trust the most; my mother and my wife. My mother, can't really process it (I believe because she is an old woman), just call me a coward and selfish for thinking of suicide (please don't be mean to my mother, she is a sweet sweet lady, I just think she either don't understand or don't know what to say). My wife is much more understanding, and she tried to make things better for me. She tried to help me with my feelings and also my work. But, it doesn't help me to remove this feelings. Sometimes, I feel worse because I am burdening her with my personal problems.I am writing to get some good advice.

I have been dealing with it fine until around February, when it really started wearing me down. I have been having suicidal thoughts, but I know that I won't ever act on them because I'm a coward and won't do it. It only used to be whenever it would flair up and my immediate thoughts would be ""the roof is tall enough to jump off of"" but now it's almost constant. My neighbour has a shotgun, and I've been eyeing it up a little too much recently. I can't see friends, I can't make art, I can't go to university anymore (I dropped out because of this.) and I can't do anything else that brings me joy.

1c4cfo4;Not a temporary problem ;autcast;Suicide is the only solution at this point. It's the only way to escape the guilt and pain I've inflicted upon myself. Nothing can mend the broken promises. Nothing can fix the mistakes. Nothing can mask the regret that will haunt me for the rest of my shallow existence.I love my family. They're all I've got, and they love me so deeply, but they don't understand me, they never did. Nevertheless, I shudder to think about how I'll destroy their lives by escaping my own hell. We've all been through so much, especially this ungodly decade. We have lost so many loved ones and I can tell that it's slowly eating away at them as well.I just can't keep going, even for the sake of their love and peace, because every living day is utter torment. Each day chips away at my psyche.I begged god, universe, whatever all powerful entity that could possibly exist and answer my pleas. Why? Why this fate? Please oh god tell me, explain to me, give me a sign, what it is that I have done? What crimes did I commit to deserve such relentless punishment? If only I knew what I had done, I'd have all the will I'd need to face my life and accept it. But as it stands now, I don't understand why universe despises me so much. It feels less like a deserved punishment and more like a cruel joke. I don't want to leave a mess behind, but I don't have anything else. I just hope nothing interferes with my plan, for all I know I'm destined to rot in my flesh prison, whether I concede to it or not.;Suicide is the only solution at this point.

1c4c8k2;I've decided that this week will be my last. No doubt.;NautilisBlitz;"I've been ""suffering"" for about my whole life with depression, anxiety, isolation, and the like. Just living feels like hell. But I know that I deserve it, either from whatever sadistic God exists or just people. I can't say I've had any traumatic things happen, but it's just been this way. Also, nothing enjoys me anymore. It's like groundhog day, but without any end. I don't even think it's depression or anything, just a need for attention. My family is caring, my friends are kind, and everything seems that be going right. But I just feel wrong. Like I shouldn't be alive in the first place. Like the most I deserve is absolute darkness and loneliness. I know there are people who have it worse, which honestly makes it seem worse for me. Because I know I shouldn't be this way.Taking all this into account, I've planned my suicide and should be dead within a week (probably less). One of my friends will supply me his gun when I'm ready. No, I won't be sharing my suicide note, as I find it rather personal to everyone in it.This won't be my last goodbye yet, I plan on doing updates prior to the night.Thank you all for listening to my rant.";"I've been ""suffering"" for about my whole life with depression, anxiety, isolation, and the like.
