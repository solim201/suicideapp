1c8ys19;Can I Fall In Love With My Boyfriend Again?;ApollotheHuman_;Hi, I’m kinda brain dead rn but I have fallen into a severely deep depression and I immediately fell out of love with my boyfriend (at least for the time being). I fell out of love randomly when I was talking to my him one night and it just seems to get worse and worse. I sometimes have bursts of feeling love for him again, but it lasts for ten seconds before I feel absolutely nothing for him again. I constantly keep getting never ending intrusive thoughts about this fact every 10 minutes and start breaking down. Nothing I do to cope and distract myself from these thoughts are helping and I’m worried that I’ll completely burnout from wanting to have anything to do with him completely if these thoughts prevail. I had the same instance with my Guinea pigs once I got stabilized on meds one time and had to rehome them because I couldn’t love them anymore. I’m scared a combination of these thoughts and getting stabilized will make the same thing happen with me and my bf. I just want to know if it’s possible my love for him can be saved because these thoughts of not feeling anything towards him (not even on a level of friendship anymore) are terrifying me, and I’m scared if I find the right meds this will become a reality. What the hell am I supposed to do anymore? I don’t think I can live with myself if this becomes a reality? Is there any hope for us? I especially hate it because he’s the best boyfriend I’ve ever had. He’s supportive, caring, kind, and loving. He’s also the reason I am making an effort to find the right medication and get help. I’m currently taking a break from talking to him because all it does is make me even more sad that I cant seem to love him atm.I just want to know if this relationship can be saved because all I can do is mourn the fact I can’t feel anything for him currently. I want something with him even if it just means we’re just gonna end up being best friends atp. I’d still prefer being in a romantic relationship with him though.;Hi, I’m kinda brain dead rn but I have fallen into a severely deep depression and I immediately fell;Need Support;4;5;2024-04-20 19:50:20;2024-04-20;Saturday;19:50:20;1990;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:13.187527

Just bitching , I guess sometimes I hope my bitching and making myself heard someone will help but no one can save and nor is it there responsibility . I am lost . I quit smoking I rarely drink , I stay out of trouble . I'm going to college I am really trying  to make my life better but why does it feel worse ?

And just stay alone and ignore my friends who do call. Because I don't want to be a burden anymore.  I'm lonely. And I wish I had someone with me to love me. But I don't deserve anyone ..

1c8y9bi;Smelly colleague at work;michaltarana;We have a colleague at work who does not take care of himself almost at all. While he was working in a shared office, he was asked repeatedly and regularly to shower, to wash his clothes and to improve his hygiene. It always worked only for couple of days.I’ve noticed that his verbal communication with the rest of the team is also deteriorating, he is gaining weight and looks less and less healthy every week. Some years ago, there always has been something we’d talk about here and there, extended small talk, some interests in common. Recently, he does not respond much to anything.Since I am not collaborating with him, I cannot really comment on his work performance. He always has been very clever and highly intelligent. He used to have a very broad general knowledge of all kinds of stuff. Our work is intellectually very challenging and requires creativity, problem solving skills, high expertise, etc. I don’t see other colleagues thinking about his mental health or him overall, beyond him being smelly. I am not close to him, we currently pass in the hallway here and there. Does this sound as a symptom of any specific mental status or psychological problem? Is there anything I can do for him at my position (work-unrelated colleague, not close friend)? The problem is that his lack of hygiene is also beyond my tolerability and I am physically unable to spend more than a minute or two in his presence. It is obvious that telling him “wash yourself and your clothes” is not really helpful. Is there anything else generic that can be done? I will be thankful for any direction or advice. Thank you and good luck!;We have a colleague at work who does not take care of himself almost at all.

At a time where I should be making memories I'm keeping myself alone and justifying it in my head that with out me they would be happier because I only see myself as a burden to everyone. I also have never been fully open to anyone in my life I just feel like I've never found anyone like that and the one person I kinda did find like that well I lost them due to my stupidness and I've just always felt alone and tbh I felt like I've been acting for so long I don't even know what my true self even is anymore. I just feel empty and I don't know what to do anymore. Its been like this for a while. I just don't have the drive and passion to live on I mostly wish people would just forget me since I'm a burden and for some reason I never think that someone would want to talk to me. I always think people take pity on me and interact with me because they feel sad looking upon my pitiful existence.

1c8y0qr;I wish I knew what was real;imnotactuallyhere14;"I have this one memory, a memory I've had for awhile but I didn't really start thinking about until a few years ago. I always tried to forget that it happened because it made me so uncomfortable, even though it's not anything truly bad.I would sit on his lap a lot (family friend, 40 years older than me), either just because I wanted to or because I wanted him to tickle or massage me. One day, he's massaging my back, and he slowly moves his hands lower and lower, until he starts to subtly put them into my pants. And that's all I remember clearly. I don't even know how old I was. Somewhere between the ages of 7-11. I don't have any doubts that this happened though.So I finally start thinking about what happened, and suddenly, it wasn't just that one thing. I ended up having a panic attack, and ever since then, I haven't been able to get rid of the feeling of something more than what I described happening. Only I don't have any clear memories of anything bad, memories come and go, and I have zero proof.I once saw what I think was him trying to search for teen porn, which is definitely weird but unfortunately not unusual. He's always called me beautiful, but that's still not unusual. When I was a bit older (13-15), he would sometimes call me babe or ""PYT"" (I hate that so much). He's called me many things over the years but I don't remember all of them. Unfortunately my brain won't let me remember all of the things I know he's done right now. Sometimes it's almost as if I know what it's like to kiss him. Sometimes I feel like I know he touched me in certain areas. But there are no real memories.I've had countless panic attacks and dissociative episodes thinking about this. Every time I feel like I can finally remember things a bit more clearly, my brain shuts off and then I forget again. I gave a very vague description of what's been going on to my therapist, but I felt absolutely nothing. There were no emotions connected to any of this, although I certainly feel them now.I wish I could just know. Sure, I'd still have to deal with all the negative feeling surrounding it, but at least the doubt would be gone.

I listened to all judgements and opinions and let them weigh on me. I never allowed myself to so much as tell someone to shut up. Recently, I haven’t. And I feel zero anxiety. You don’t like me? Fuck you, I don’t care. You think I’m X, Y, or Z? Fuck you, I don’t care. You do me wrong? You’re going to make it right. I demand respect now and I haven’t felt anxiety in a while.

Now, I don't think I've fully got over my depression, but I'm feeling much happier much more regularly. I'm able to complete more every day tasks, and able to get out more. But I feel I'm either still depressed or have become very mentally weak. This is because when something happens that would usually upset somone, but leave them able to just feel a bit upset for a while and then be fine again, or leave them upset throughout the day but able to hide it and be fine again the next day, it just sends me back into a state of absolute depression. This could even be the most minor thing, something that other people wouldn't even care about, and it would really upset me and send me into a depressive state. I also often fall into a depressive state randomly for no apparent reason quite regularly.I was wandering if anyone could help me figure out why these Happen, or give me any advice on it.

I know that it isn't just being mad and happy and that there's manic and mania and probably more stuff that Im not informed about. All I know is that I feel like I'm going crazy. I  don't really have friends, I do but none of them talk to me outside of seeing me in person and I don't see any of them in person at school so pretty much every day I'm completely silent until I go home and then I talk at home, sometimes I feel invisible and worthless at home too though because no one cares for what I have to say. I've just been feeling like I'm going insane my whole senior year, especially because of my emotions. I will go from dissociating all day at school to then coming home and my emotions are pretty wild at home, but I'm a generally calm person so all of my emotions feel muted and I don't really outwardly express them unless it's annoyance. It scares me how I just go through the motions at school and don't really feel anything or talk to anyone, I feel so emotionless at school, like a deer in headlights.  There's been a few times I've come home and went straight to my room and just cried, once for hours and no one checked up on me.  I feel so worthless, but not all of the time. A lot of the times I go on a trip where I feel amazing and on top of the world. I feel the opposite of worthless and like I can accomplish anything. Sometimes it lasts more than a day but other times I think about something and I immediately feel worthless again. I just feel so alone and in my head and no one knows that Im losing my mind. I've cried in front of my mom a few times but she doesn't know how to comfort me and once she asked if it was because she is a bad parent, which was partly the reason at the time but mostly just because I wish that she would care more. I found out my dad isn't my biological dad in 2019 and I still haven't met my bio dad, and I'm too scared to ask my mom anymore because she will say something will happen and it never does.

1c8w8wf;Depersonalisation?;decadentdarkness;I realised today that a prevailing issue I have is never feeling like myself - as in, since going through many depressive episodes since 2016, I have lost myself.  I know with depression this isn’t an uncommon feature, but lately I really have felt weird and like an alien almost. I don’t even know what my interests are - or they do, but they’re far away and belong to someone else (old me.)  I hope this makes sense.Is this depersonalisation?I can only describe it as feeling very disconnected to my body and when I look in the mirror or at selfies I feel like it’s not me.  It’s the oddest thing but I realised today this is a definite ongoing thing.  Like if I go shopping I don’t know what to buy as I don’t know myself anymore.  I typically get around in the same jeans and clothing that is very daggy and again feel like a stranger. I’ve lost that desire to be sexy or attractive outside some basic makeup and struggle to commit to lose weight - because again I feel so disconnected and like I’m not myself - and therefore it doesn’t matter. I feel like my ptsd and trauma has erased who I am and I’m like a shell of who I used to be.

I know this is cries for help but I don’t know what to do. We live together, so it’s easy to check up on her but I feel that it’s getting worse. She goes through waves of happiness, depression, and emptiness. She currently works 2 jobs & is a student. I know she’s overwhelmed due to this semester being her last & having an important state board exam coming up. She also just got out of an 8 year relationship and recently got into a big fight with one of her best friends who is also her boss. She’s always worried about money & is sure that this will cause her to lose her job. She doesn’t know what’s caused her current depression but she’s been crying herself to sleep about every night. She’ll come home from outings and tell me that the whole drive home she’d think about driving the car into a wall and that she’ll go over 80mph. I have suggested to her that we could go see a therapist together, she’s not opposed but she shrugs her shoulders every time I talk about scheduling. I have gone through similar emotions before but only I (alone) could get myself out of it. Most of the times with distractions, new things that fixate my emotions. She goes to the beach in the next state with her friends about every other weekend which is one of her favorite things but even coming home from those she tells me how disconnected she feels from her peers and sometimes even herself.;I F(27) feel helpless when my sister comes to me such thoughts.

I’ve had SW involvement before and it didn’t go well they made me lose trust in so many ways, and my parents said if I get them involved again I will be kicked out.

Weirdly I get a strange kick out of this, like when I read emails from my university threatening to kick me out or asking why I haven't completed said essay it gives me a rush that feels almost pleasurable. Also when I look at a piece of work I have to do in a few days and realise that it's way too much to do in such a short space of time, and therefore pretty much impossible, I laugh and seem to find it funny? When people say that I'm ruining my life and job prospects I just don't care at all. I also reject girls who I am interested in.

1c8rqut;How do you get over trauma with no root cause?;Odd_Consequence3623;"Literally since I can remember, I've struggled with intense physical symptoms of anxiety which lead to loss of appetite, and when the anxiety is particularly intense, I dry heave and vomit. My parents viewed it as me simply refusing to eat and didn't seek medical or psychological help. I would be forced to eat or be physically disciplined if I threw up. I would vomit almost everything, including foods I enjoyed, which made things difficult and led to a lot of anxiety around food in general. Despite this,I was able to eat regularly enough if they were “safe foods”, which I was used to eating. Attending boarding school at age 8, alleviated pressure as there were routine foods and I wasn’t forced to eat but the issue still continued.    Today, my main struggle centres on restaurants and formal dining.They trigger me because restaurants meant more anger from my parents, more embarrassment for me, and an audience for what I was going through. Over time, my parents developed strategies for me like eating on an empty stomach, having water to wash down the food, and knowing beforehand where the bathrooms and exits are which helped and which I still use today.    Despite managing to hide or control my nausea and vomiting most of the time, these strategies haven't fully resolved my issue. My main problem today arises with dating. Dating puts my anxiety at 100 which leads to my coping mechanisms being ineffective. I end up dry heaving even on an empty stomach. This is incredibly embarrassing and dysregulating. SO, I avoid dating altogether.    My counsellor and I have tried to uncover the root cause of my issue, but without any success. By ""root,"" I mean the instance that initiated this whole problem. I tried to recall childhood memories but I simply can't recall the root; this is the only life I've known. I feel utterly powerless. My guess is that my brain linked food to anxiety due to early experiences, but it's only a guess. My parents haven't provided answers, leaving me guessing. I genuinely don’t know if I had a physical illness that turned mental or what. Any insight would be appreciated.    Thanks for reading this    Side Note: This behaviour isn’t linked with my body image, and I believe it is purely a result of anxiety.    TLDR:  I've dealt with intense anxiety symptoms since childhood, including losing my appetite and vomiting, especially in stressful situations like formal dining. This stems from childhood experiences where my parents forced me to eat and punished me for vomiting. These issues persist into adulthood, particularly affecting my dating life, as I struggle with intense physical symptoms during dates. Despite seeking counselling, we haven't been able to identify the root cause. I believe it's purely anxiety-related, unrelated to body image. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.";Literally since I can remember, I've struggled with intense physical symptoms of anxiety which lead ;Question;0;2;2024-04-20 14:47:37;2024-04-20;Saturday;14:47:37;2856;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:13.249427

1c8rmf8;Dealing with public humiliation;Snapsyman;Yesterday I was supposed to give a short presentation over Skype meeting to my colleagues. It wasn’t anything big, maybe 250 words on paper. Some 50 people were online and when I started I immediately noticed panic attack taking over. My voice became strained, and I tried to compensate by coughing, speaking louder etc. Quickly I was reduced into a sorry sight but kept fighting and tried to push through. At some point the chair of this meeting called it a time and I was given maybe a minute to collect myself. After that short break I regained my voice and was able to finish for the last part of the presentation. I felt I was humiliated in front of my colleagues, coworkers and quite literally lost my face. I have no desire to show up at the work place after this. I’m about 40 years old male and have a wife and a child. So I guess I can’t just leave my job (a solution I’m thinking of).In my life I’ve had massive issues with public speaking but I’ve managed it by beta blockers, breathing techniques etc. I’ve been to psychotherapy and tried to addresses the root causes (shame, neglect as kid, fear of people in authority).For the last 8 years it has been good, but now I am dumbfounded because I thought I was in control of it. This episode came without any warning - a lightning from the clear sky. And this makes this so much more frightening. Not only I lost my face but a new fear was created for the coming years. All I can do right now is feel crushing shame, loss of all confidence as a man and just lay in my bed.;Yesterday I was supposed to give a short presentation over Skype meeting to my colleagues.

1c8qx0w;I just need to rant and get it off my chest. ;SushiBurritoDood;I’m in my early 20’s for context. Last week I got into an at fault accident but months prior leading up to that, have had a lot on my mind and just need really need an outlet to vent out to. Let me start by sharing that at the start of the year my dad nearly had a heart attack and was sent to the hospital, luckily recovery was a success but he isn’t at 100% and possibly may not be able to return to work again. Which lands on me to work double to keep things up to date whether that be bills, check ups, etc. I’m currently now living with him to take care of things. My sister on the other hand, had moved to a different state and honestly haven’t had any sort of contact ever since. This again took a toll on me, because the way she went about it, told me a day before moving and was like “hey I’m moving to _____” and that was the end of it.After all that, mentally I’m at a point where I just feel alone and my mind was been racing of all these things happening at once. I don’t know what happened, maybe I was distracted or something but ended up hitting the car in front of me. Fortunately the other person was completely okay and no one was injured. However, my car was deemed at a total loss and now my mental state is worse than ever. I have no access of getting to work, visiting my therapist, and I feel like drinking all day.I need help and I don’t know what to do at this point. I didn’t want to pile up more stress for my family but in a way I feel that it is too late for those words. For the entire week I’ve had a headache that hasn’t passed and my appetite practically nonexistent with all the stress on my head. I’ve reached out to my friends and they’ve been amazing throughout the entire process. Making sure if I need a ride, go out with them to destress, etc. but that being said, I don’t want to rely on them forever.

It seems like good looking people have it so much easier. I know this is an unfair and damaging thought, but I can’t help it. These thoughts just stick with me and hurt me deeply. I want to be able to feel good about myself and be a positive influence on others, but at the moment that is far from the truth. How can I overcome this? Do you have any tips? Because I think I am my own worst enemy.;As of the last few months, I (M21) struggle a lot with negative thoughts and self sabotage.

1c8olsf;Does anyone else worry incessantly about WW3?;__drink_some_water__;I’ve always been worried about the end of the world, since I was a little kid. Whether it be the sun exploding, aliens, global warming, bullshit like Covid, the government doing shady shit, etc it always feels like the planet is one wrong move away from ceasing to exist. Knowing this fills me with a sense of dread, and always has.Lately with tensions rising around the world, I’m getting scared. I keep having nightmares about looking out the window to see a nuke light up the sky, or military personnel storming my backyard. I’m am fucking terrified. I live in Ontario, right next to the us border. If the states pisses someone off and they get bombed, so do we. I am terrified.On the flip side, I genuinely hate my life and the government and half wish for a nuclear war. If the government collapsed maybe things would go back to normal. I don’t know man, I’ve seen too many movies probably. But I am genuinely feelin like a schizo lately. Every little sound I hear outside makes me drop everything and stare out the window with the mind of a schizo. I don’t trust anyone anymore but the people I know. I don’t trust my phone to not record me unknowingly. I don’t trust the government. I don’t trust that the leaders of western civilization have anything under control, and I think we are very close to getting the “nuclear missiles inbound” notification on our phones. The whole thing makes me want to take my own life before they do, at least that way I’d gain some form of control over my destiny. I am seriously starting to lose my wit.Just venting more then anything, has anyone else experienced this sort of thing? I feel like a psychopath. The government hates people like me. I’ll never conform more then I need to. I am simply surviving in this pre apocalyptic landscape.Fuck power. This planet needs love, and this planet needs to be truthful with each other. Something we have never done before. It’ll never happen though.Whether in our lifetimes or not, this planets demise will be humans destroying each other.I don’t even know if this shit is real anymore.;I’ve always been worried about the end of the world, since I was a little kid.

1c8nzi2;Im uglier than almost everyone I see and it has been takinh a toll ony mental health for a decade;Miserable-Example831;"So, I'm 24, will be turning 25 in 6 months. I'm gay and Indian. Honestly, I'm uglier and shorter than 99% of the people I see around me. Have always been ignored, invisibalised and even mocked or bullied because of it since I was like 11-12. I've no idea about what a normal existence devoid of the fear of being bullied for your appearance is like. For quite some time, I've been living in a relatively liberal and young part of the country and everywhere i see is people hanging out with their boyfriends/girlfriends. Almost every gay person i talk to has had many beautiful experiences since they were 18-19. On the other hand, I've never been loved by anyone romantically. I've no experience of being loved even at this age. During college, every gay guy on grindr/tinder rejected me.Then there's my experience on dating app's which is always so traumatic for me. Rejections by almost everyone I send my pics to. Even those people who text everyone and get creepy reject me. I don't care that much about romance or sex anymore, but it takes a serious toll on my self esteem. I literally feel scared of touching others lest I might pollute them with my ugliness.I subconsciously always believe that I'm inferior to others. I've started genuinely hating my parent's for even thinking of having children considering how both of them have bad genetics and couldn't marry if not for arranged marriage. It kills me that I'm absolute genetic trash, that I can never arouse the feeling of love from anyone.Anyway, I just realised all this yesterday, when I was struggling in gym and I heard a big gymbro say that ""I can finish him in one punch"" about me. My first reaction to that was ""yeah I'm a subhuman and he can do that"" but that made me realise that thinking like that isn't normal at all and that's been my thought process for 5-6 years. I've aged and my hair has turned grey due to depression in the last 5-6 years.All of it has made me a bitter person. Everytime I see a pretty person, an extreme feeling of envy stings me. Honestly, life to me seems futile. I see no point in living at all. Death seems to be the only liberation from the state of mind that I'm in. I don't really wanna kill myself but the thought of living life scares me. I doubt if therapy would help tho because my problems aren't ""in my head"". They're real problems that have real impact on me every single day.";So, I'm 24, will be turning 25 in 6 months. I'm gay and Indian.

1c8n6ae;Is this considered self harm?;Salt-Tomorrow8686;So I've been peeling the skin on my fingers so as long as I can remember. It just feels like a bad habit like biting my nails, which manifested into this but I dont think it's that bad.I do this, like I said, as a habit and when I'm bored, its not like I do this when I'm stressed or to punish myself. But it does leave pretty bad looking scars, and it hurts too. Especially when I'm showering and the shampoo gets into the open flesh. And also, I do bleed if I peel myself too hard.Idk, I feel like this doesn't have any impact on me or my health, it heals rather quickly. Some annoyance I've got was one time getting my finger prints for my ID. Yeah my fingerprints looks pretty janky and the police kinda made fun of me. And another thing is I cant unlock my phone using the fingerprint anymore because ever since I ripped it and it healed back. It just doesn't recognize my fingerprints.The people around me said that this is a bad habit, which I know obviously, but my bf said that this is self harm. Which I dont know if I agree with. I mean, it technically can be self harm, but if you take that logic and apply it to eating fast food that's not good for your health, then many things would be self harm.

More than a week na ako naka SL and still struggling with my depressive mood and chronic distress. iniinom ko naman yung mood stabilizer na priniscribed niya but then parang hindi na kinakaya nung gamot ma stabilized yung mood ko. So she added anti depressant na. Sabi nga niya ang advised niya na extension ng leave ko is 2 weeks pero natakot na ko. Kasi baka mamaya i terminate na ko nung TL ko. Though sabi naman nung Local HR I can apply for sabatical leave pero hindi ko din kasi kaya yun since ako bread winner ng family.  And they assure me na hindi lang ako yung ganito. Eh what if mga manager levels na yung iba kaya keri lang na they took 2-3 months leave. Hindi ko na alam gagawin ko natatakot din ako mag sabi sa Manager ko na pinapa extend yung med leave ko though may provided naman na med cert from the Psychiatrist.

I told him we can't roleplay anymore because I feel too bad, we can't even talk anymore.

1c8m233;My family is causing panic attacks;lurania19;Hello.. So I am a 21 year old student living at home. 2 of my 3 siblings still live at home too (all in their 30s) and its a bit cramped at times. My brother will always be gaming at night and he slams all the doors and yells and prevents me from sleeping (his room is underneath mine) but he doesn’t care. My sister is miserable. She’s been struggling w jobs because she manages to gets a shitstorm wherever she starts working and has just started another job.My eldest sister who moved out has a disabled child and is unhappy w her marriage.And my parents are horrible too. They are toxic..they yell at me and verbally abuse me (and my mum used to get physical too, for example when I didn’t want to eat) and then tell me to come hug them (“Come give your mum a hug..I know you won’t turn your mummy down right? She’d be so sad “). I developed an immense guilt complex for that and many other reasons. I grew up being my mums therapist and she often talked about killing herself whenever I did something she didn’t like (not wanting to have breakfast w the family, me playing video games,.. I never djd anything bad like drugs lol or go out at night). I lost all of my friends bc she hinderd me from going out for years and told me Im not allowed or complained that im always out when i was going out once a week maybe.Now my parents are gone for three weeks for private reasons.For reference, they deny all kinds of mental illness. When I tried to talk about the fact that I have depression at dinner time bc thats the only time we are together (my dads basically not even there), they told me to be quiet and eat up and to not bother them. I asked them to pay attention to me and what I am saying and they went “We are eating right now. Don’t bother us with such topics. Get over it.”I got a kitten a week ago and thought it’d help w depression and anxiety but I was wrong. Its my first cat, I grew up with a dog who was my absolute rock but I overestimated myself. I can’t cope with the kitten. My mum isn’t here so she doesn’t know how exhausting he is and she is not allowing me to rehome him (she wants him to hunt down rats in the yard when he’s older..she’s a bit naive and stupid).I am overwhelmed. My sister admitted that my messages complaining about the lack of sleep piss her off and I need to shut the fuck up about it and it’s my own fault. My eldest was here too and they both yelled at me left and right and wouldn’t stop coming at me for an hour. I went to my room and they followed me and ignored me asking for space/to be left alone.Now, I got so overwhelmed I just lost it.I ran upstairs (we were eating just then with them telling me I’m always making a long face and I can never act happy for their sake blabla and “what kind of issues could u have? Why are u depressed then? List your reasons! You had everything we didn’t have! You live in a house and you get food and you have hobbies [That i all had to quit and paid for myself…]”).I ran upstairs and SCREAMED. So loudly and so like..I don’t know. I just lost it and started sobbing and locked myself in the bathroom. My brother came out of his room yelling saying “why can’t this dramatic bitch cry like a normal person or suck it up?”…I had a panic attack. It was my third one (all because of my sister(s)/family) in the span of 6 months. The first one was okay, I got blue lips and hands but I was fine. The second one was a paralysis. I couldnt move my lips hands legs and my fingers were cramping together in a weird position. I got it after my sister got angry at me for not doing the dishes (that my brother had caused and I hadn’t seen as I was upstairs) and slammed my own door in my face when I tried to hold it shut because she came at me like godzilla. I got the door in my face, fell into my chair and then slammed into my desk.I had bruises everywhere.And then I had a panic attack. I tried to tell my family but they just brushed it off so I distanced myself from them.So yesterday, Im in the bathroom, and my sisters run upstairs. It sounded foggy but they told me to open the door and to stop crying and to wash my face with cold water. I couldn’t reply or tell them I needed to just be alone and they were scaring me even more and making it worse as I was paralysed. My brother then came and slammed the door in with his leg. I screamed. It was terrifying and drove me into a stronger paralysis. My face cramped, I couldn’t even look up and I felt like I was slowly losing consciousness from panic and fear. My eldest sister hit me. Hard. Several times. Telling me I look like I need a shower whilet hitting me.My brother was yelling that they need to dump me at a closed institution or give me away to an orphanage (im an adult? They dont understand lol). My other sister then told them to lesve and sat down in front of me trying to calm me down but she started crying herself. The people pleaser in me thought “No i made her cry”…whilst going through a panic attack. Lol.And she went “Why didnt u tell us? U have to distance urself when u feel this way!!” Girl I tried. U literally kicked the door in…I wanted to give the kitten away because the lack of sleep and the responsibility just made me worse and he’d be happier somewhere else anyways. But she said its our kitten now and we will take care of him together and she’d take him that night. Lol.I brought his stuff into her room, and dhe was in there for 20-30 minutes constantly screaming “No! Get down! No! Don’t do that! Hey! Don’t bite me” Until i gave up (i already expected this. She was at work every day so she only saw him cuddly and told me several times im being dramatic and making the decision too quickly as its only been a week)I went to her room to see what happened and she goes “I didnt know he’d be like this. He’s going nuts and running around and I already played w him for two hours… No you’re right. We need to give him away.”And then she proceeded to put his stuff in the hallway.💀💀The fact they drove me into a panic attack just for her to feel the exact same way and she didn’t even TRY to keep him in her room durin the night..She now thinks Im some crazy person (so does my other family) and that I need to go see someone for this. But I only ever got panic attacks because they genuinely pushed me too far and scared me and I feel stuck in this house bc they are blackmailing me about moving out. They know about my non muslim long distance bf and went “If u move out before blocking him, we will tell our parents and they will disown you (which they might)” Obviously I wont block him. He is my best friend, we have been dating for two years and he has gone through it all w me and never given up on me… I feel so stuck in this house. Especially w the mitten..;Hello..

1c8m15x;Advice on adult tantrums;MagzOAT;I don’t know how to describe them other than tantrums. I’ve been living  with my boyfriend (30M) for 6 years. It was a long distance relationship before I left to his country. It’s been really difficult. He has been under depression treatment for all this time and nothing seemed to be working. He started new therapy three years ago and I feel this was when everything went downhill. The therapist was a student doing her practices in the center he went to. I don’t know if she was diagnosis happy, but she started working close with his psychiatrist. She diagnosed him first with schizoid personality disorder. The psychiatrist didn’t truly see him. Every time tending him over the phone. He agreed with the therapist and changed his meds. After this my boyfriend became really angry and cold. Like he embraced the diagnosis and completely shut me down, became cruel and detached. After a year or so of him not getting better, his therapist diagnosed him with schizophrenia and his psychiatrist followed through. Changed his meds again and things became worse. His anxiety got out of control. He started crying and yelling and having these “adult tantrums”. Thing of the way a baby falls or trips and suddenly starts crying, mouth open and big tears. He lost his job during this time. The meds were not helping. After a year of this, at the beginning of this year, his psychiatrist dropped him as a patient. He got mad because I asked my boyfriend to get a second opinion and said opinion disagreed with the diagnosis. Well, now he’s going to a new doctor and his therapist said she would “go back to regular therapy since it turned out he wasn’t sick after all.” Meds were changed again, now with antidepressants and anxiety meds. The problem is the tantrums keep getting worse. He has no control over his emotions at all. He cries for hours, desperately, keeps saying he doesn’t want to live anymore and how he is suffering all the time, and it happens multiple times a day. I have to be honest. At first I tried my best to be patient. Treat him like a child. Now I just move away. Nothing works to calm him down. I have no clue what to do.;I don’t know how to describe them other than tantrums.

1c8ld96;I (20 F) am having a really hard time finding a job;frackfuckfrick;I’m (20 F) struggling so hard to find a job. I graduated high school almost two years ago and I want to work (my first job) by summer or by the fall at the latest, and I just started searching recently, but I’m already losing hope. I’ve spent so many hours today and yesterday trying to find things I think I’ll like in terms of jobs on Indeed, but I can’t find anything. Even the jobs I thought I’d like that require more previous experience and/or relocating have at least one other thing I don’t like about them. By things I don’t like, I mean things that would also be too much for me to handle due to my current mental state, and for other reasons too. There are so many things I can’t do and don’t want to do and that’s one of the things that’s making this so hard. Those things that I’m unable to do in terms of working include cooking, baking, standing and/or walking/moving for long periods of time, driving, lifting heavy things, being outside, being very outgoing, being overly professional like maintaining a physically professional appearance for example, doing dangerous things, using a lot of specific computer programs like Microsoft (I only have very little knowledge on Google and Microsoft programs), typing fast, operating phones/phone systems (I can type in a phone number, press call/hang up/mute/speaker and that’s it), babysitting/taking care of kids, working fast-paced/under pressure/in a highly stressful environment (especially since I literally needed iep accommodations to help prevent me from doing school work in those conditions), being a cashier, anything requiring me to be highly intelligent/pretty skilled in math/writing/science/common school subjects like that, and anything that would require me to have some kind of college/university/etc degree/certificate. So… I’m pretty limited in terms of what I can do (and I don’t mind sharing this since I’m pretty anonymous on here, so I’m ok with sharing that I live in Bothell in WA State). In terms of what my other struggles are, I have severe depression (have had depression since June 2020), passive suicidal thoughts, severe ocd (my most agonizing mental illness), possibly cptsd, possibly gad, social anxiety, possibly bpd (struggles with abandonment fears, paranoia, emotional instability, impulsivity, self harm, and feelings of emptiness), no friends (and don’t think I want any for many reasons that mainly relate to my mental illnesses, heartbreak of some sort (I’d rather not get into detail on what exactly that is for me), grief in general, narcissistic parents and siblings (especially my parents who are also verbally abusive, mostly/mainly my mom), periods of long-term isolation due to my struggles (especially my in-house family-related ones), symptoms of anorexia/eating disorder behaviors (and it’s definitely something that causes me to be more physically weak but I don’t like too much physical work for other reasons anyway). I’ve thought about trying other websites to search for jobs, and idk if that’ll work but however I am willing to try possibly reliable recommendations. If that doesn’t work, then idk what I’ll do. I also can’t afford therapy or anything like that and I think there’s (possibly, I’d rather not ask them about it for many reasons) absolutely no way my parents would help me pay for that. I’m not sure if applying for disability will ever work for me if that’s something I might need to do in order to get money, and what especially sucks is that I want to move out away from my family asap because I hate it here so much (where I live, aka with them). But I don’t have the money and/or friends for that, and might not ever have those things. Also, I’ve wanted work to help distract me from my issues and keep me away from home. I might not be able to get that though. I feel so screwed and feel so stressed and suicidal everyday for many reasons. Maybe I’ll just have to find a way to end my life someday, idk. What the fuck can I do? Is there any hope for me (I don’t think so)? This is random but sometimes I just wish I could be in a trusted persons care forever and/or have good/trusted friends… but that’s impossible for me for many reasons and I have bad trust issues too. Any advice appreciated on all this that I’m dealing with (I fully trust literally no one but maybe asking for advice might help me in some way and I’m sorry if this sounds rude, I’m just really struggling a lot and also needed to vent somewhere).;I’m (20 F) struggling so hard to find a job.

Recently just got out of my 3rd relationship, which is completely my fault, I’m not initiate anything in either just hold hands, kiss, sex and even the start of the relationship was her leading. This made her think I’m not serious about our relationship. Is not I’m not serious, is that I concern so much “will she like this or not” “does she want this rn” “am I thinking it right?” where I just decided to do not and let things flow. At the end, she asked me how I think of why we ending the relationship, all I said was “I agreed and understand” she even said “that’s all you gonna say” and cry a little. Now I feel like I’m a terrible person, I’m a play boy, I’m cold, dry, became a kind person I hate.In my life, I have no goal, nothing.

1c8kb04;The tunnel does have another side;Internal_Struggles;"I've been in a bit of a downturn with my mental health recently. So I decided to look through my old history and see whats changed. I wanted to share with everyone here that thinks its hopeless, that if you push through, it can get better. I am by no means without issies now, but I've come too far to give up now.If anyone wants to know the ""secret"", its to simply love yourself, even if you have to lie through your teeth to get started. Thats what I did, and now its (somewhat) come true. And finally, you don't need a reason to keep on living. I've lost all of my resons over the years, and yet I'm still here.Here is a post I made about a year ago (was taken down since) right before my second attempt on my own life:I think im going to die soon.Theres no other way to put this. I think I'm going to die soon. Every day is torture for me. Every sleepless night. Every morning I'm forced to get up off an hour of sleep and go to work. Every time I come in late and my coworkers make fun of me. Every time I come home and lay in my bed and fall into an abyss of loneliness. Every friendship and relationship that I can only see as a shallow shell of what it should and could be. I don't see any future. I dropped out of college because I couldn't leave my dorm room. I choke up even thinking about it or going back to the city I did that to myself in. Im stuck in a hole and it just keeps going deeper and people say once you hit rock bottom theres nothing but to go up but its not true. Theres no rock bottom its an endless pit and the worst part is that I am sometimes allowed to see the top but always dragged back down.My meds don't work. They make me feel better for a while then just stop. Something always gets worse. I can't sleep as much. I already have insomnia. Functioning off 2 hours of sleep and stims alone isn't possible for me. I get suicidal. I make plans in my head when I'm that sleep deprived. My appetite goes to shit. I start gagging if I even put a single bite of food in my mouth when I'm on meds. What the fuck am I supposed to do. I've tried so hard for so long. How am I supposed to do all this shit. I can't even keep consistent doctors appointments to save my life. Hell I can't even make an appointment after I skipped my last one. I can't ""just do it"". I can't ask for help. I've already done that. No one know how to help me. All they do is ask ""how can I help you"". How the fuck am I supposed to know. I would have fucking done it if I knew how to help myself. That made me laugh. Anyways, Im sure no one gives a flying fuck. I'm either restrained by the expectations of others or myself. Im going to die soon and I have accepted that. It will probably be by my own hand. I can't stop trying to live up to the expectations of others because its the only thing keeping me alive. I also can't stop the expectations of myself. Its just not possible. Im so scared because I don't like pain. I've run from it my whole life. Dying will be painful. But I can't imagine it being any more painful than what I'm feeling.";I've been in a bit of a downturn with my mental health recently.

1c8ka5h;I relapsed in front of my boyfriend. ;nose_stuffing;"Tw: Talks of self harm, alcohol, drug use, SA. So I hurt myself (f22) in the presence of my boyfriend (m23). I’ve always struggled with mental health problems due to a troubled childhood. To keep it brief, drug addict mother, entering the foster care system at age 5, csa while within foster care, death of my twin sister at age 6, being adopted by my grandparents who wound up incredibly abusive, in and out of group homes from 17-20, along with separate instances of SA throughout my life. Last night, my boyfriend had left in the evening to work, I was hanging around his place playing games on his computer like I typically do on nights where I’m free. Out of boredom, I decided to start drinking to loosen up and just relax. I don’t usually drink, and keep it social but I’ve always had problems with self control and monitoring my intake when I do (which is why I don’t). At a certain point, I started to become incredibly sad. I was thinking a lot about my ex and the way he had treated me throughout. I had left him to be with my current boyfriend, after my current boyfriend and I had sex in an incredibly emotional night. We both broke up with our partners to be with one another, having shared the same emotions for each other for years now. His relationship was a 7 year long one rife with emotional abuse. We’ve been together for about 4 months now but have been friends for 5 years. At that point in the evening I could feel myself begin to spiral. I took some codeine and smoked some weed trying to push away what I was feeling. I wanted to do anything to push away the pain that was bubbling up. I made a poor decision to self harm in this state. At this point, I was too inebriated to stop. I had a moment of clarity after a particularly bad wound, and completely broke down. I had been 2 years clean of any sort of self destructive behaviour up until then, having frequented hospitals for mental health incidents constantly for years prior. My bf started texting me after he got off his shift really late into the night. I began to panic, texting him apologies. He called me and at that point I began to sob on the phone with him. I was really far gone at this point and my memories of the rest of the evening are incredibly choppy. He kept me on the phone with him until he came home. I had locked myself in his bedroom, but the moment he tried entering I got up and opened the door. I can only imagine the sight he saw when he entered. His girlfriend, a drunken bleeding mess, uncontrollably sobbing.  He cleaned me up and held me, and then moved me into the shower to try and sober me up. I remember yelling at him at a certain point, to where he told me I was scaring him, so I stopped and broke down again. I think after talking for a while we wound up in bed. I’m so incredibly ashamed of losing control like this. My life has generally been pretty great these past couple of years, I’m in therapy, my social circle is filled with wonderful people, and I’ve gone no contact with family. My boyfriend has been a wonderful support and is genuinely one of the kindest souls I’ve come across in this lifetime. His previous partner (24m) was incredibly abusive towards him, burning himself in front of him to illicit responses, cutting himself and locking the door to make him panic, constantly threatening suicide if he should ever leave. Their breakup was messy. My boyfriend wound up traumatized by a lot of what had transpired there. I never intended for any of this to have happened. I woke up this morning and saw the aftermath. I was shocked, I had been doing so well and had been clean for so long.  My boyfriend woke up with me and helped me get around this morning, changing the gauze and we talked and talked for hours. He told me parts of what we talked about after finding me, but he seemed pained by some of the other things I had said. He had been incredibly scared, understandably so. We both held each other and cried a lot today. We played some games with our friends in the evening and I think we both started to feel better. I just feel incredibly terrible and angry with myself for ever having him witness something as terrifying as that. He’s such a kind and gentle person, who tries his best to understand everyone around him and their situations. I didn’t know that I was in pain until I went overboard and made a stupid mistake. I never want to do this again and I want to better myself so that I can give a fraction of the kindness he has given me. I’ve never had a love like this, and I truly appreciate everything he has offered. I’m scared of making a mistake like this again and losing him in the future and want to strive to become better. Thank you for listening. TLDR; drank and drugged myself into oblivion, self harmed in this state, bf came home and found me.";Tw: Talks of self harm, alcohol, drug use, SA.

1c8k5sv;Am I overreacting by feeling angry and upset about the toxicity in my household that is not directly directed towards me? ;throw_a_ventaway;"Tldr: Am i wrong for being angry and upset at my stepparent and the whole situation even though it is not me that is going through a divorce and having a relationship with them? My parent and stepparent are at the moment going through a divorce, but they still live in the same house, they just sleep in seperate rooms and, me an adult, also still lives with them. They agreed that the stepparent will eventually find their own place and leave. My stepparent has been very toxic towards my parent, throughout the years this has manifested itself as emotional and physical abuse of my parent. I have a younger sibling as well and with some help they managed to get their own place and move out last year because they couldnt cope with the situation anymore. I am still in it,  but i am in my last few months of uni and hoping to get a full time job soon so I can leave too and of course the stepparent should be looking for their own place as we speak right now. But the stepparent isnt, in fact they are doing everything they can to make my parents life unbearable and also they have on multiple occasions throughout the years made clear that they actually hated me and my sibling, we actually had to walk on eggshells to not cause any troubles since the stepparent moved in (10 years ago almost). We would receive mean looks, they even  pushed us in an amgry way, they would take all the attention to themselves when we were trying to have quality time with our parent and whenever the stepparent would have a fight with the parent they would also bitch and be mean to us even though we did not have anything to do with it. We also have two dogs that the stepparent only cuddles with but when it comes to taking care of them, letting them out, feeding them, getting their medicine they dont do anything. My parent found out that the stepparent is now talking to potential new partners while they sleep in the room next to my parent and while they still live here and yesterday my stepparent and parent had a fight about that. The stepparent was filming my parent as my parent was being angry and asking for explanation and when the stepparent is leaving and that they should leave if they found someone else, because the stepparent wanted proof of abuse towards themselves, while they used to be the abusive one during the ENTIRE relationship. To be honest I am so fucking tired of this situation and I am reallly angry, anxious and upset about this stepparent. It is not only about the way they treats my parent, the dogs and us, but also about the way we have all had to adjust our lives and for my sibling and I our development during our teens and early twenties, which he ruined for us... I am really angry really angry and cant stand this person. I am realizing now how damaged and mistrusting i have become because of this. Yet my parent keeps insisting that this is their battle and that i should just let it go. I understand that it is their partner which they are divorcing but still I cant let go because i feel like it has impacted me my life and my familys life too much and my parent keeps insisting that its not about us. While the stepparent keeps referring to the parent as the parent and their ""cancerous ass kids"" while fighting with my parent. I am really upset. I just want to know, am I wrong for feeling this way, should I indeed try to let it go even though i do feel involved while my parent says I am not as I am not in a relationship with the stepparent? I am sorry for the long post.

1c8jjf3;I’m just tired of being lonely;Ashamed_Structure247;Hey everyone! (25m)So most of my life I’ve always been told I would make a good counsellor or therapist, which sometimes it feels good to help out others. But whenever I get the “anytime you need to talk I’m here for you” it always ends up the same. After I talk to said persons they always end up saying “ummm I think you need to go on anti depressants or anxiety meds”.I was on anti depressants and anxiety meds for 4 years, don’t worry my doctor realized I didn’t need meds and weened me off. But with said pills just made me worse I gained weight  (before meds I was 150 ibs and during I got to 280 within the first year) and during the four years I was becoming like my mom and grandma… just another pill junkie looking for a quick fix.Now I realize at this point no one really gets where I’m coming from, simply just cause I moved a lot due to my mom. We moved in total ten times because she met some dude off a website. Every time we moved I was always the outcast or the new weird kid, I didn’t really have time to make any actual connections with anyone. Cause if I did then we moved again, everyone has their rock but to most people I’m just a dude who gives solid advice. It just feels as though no matter where I go I’m just a stranger, I’m just tired of not having a place to call home, I’m tired of not having someone to turn to who understands my level of normalcy.To most people I meet they grew up in 1-3 places most, so every story told is either too or from another person so there relatively new story’s. But every time I help someone it’s always the same pretexts the same story I heard from another town over. So I end up knowing what to say in said moments cause I’ve either heard or been through the same situation. And for some ungodly reason I’ve been cursed with oh he might be busy so let’s not invite him, or oh hey we went out why didn’t you join (it’s cause I wasn’t told any plans). And anytime I tell friends or family that I’m not busy they’ll make plans and just as their leaving say “ok we’re gonna go to the lake see ya later” and when they get back they wonder why I didn’t join(because I was given 5 seconds to respond). I’m always just the afterthought and I’m tired of it, when will someone want to just hangout and if we do it’s just so they can rant about all their problems, but if I try to rant either during or different times I always get “oh sorry I don’t have time to listen maybe another time”. I’m just tired of being lonely, an after thought, the outcast, A dude with to much on my plate. How come I’m always good at fixing other peoples problems but my own, how come I always have to listen but not reciprocate my own life. Why am I always left with this hanging gloom of being a burden to others, why is it that I just feel like a bug to those around me.When will I finally be free of this dreaded feeling of loneliness, how much longer do I have to endure this loneliness. How much longer do I have to go before someone realizes I’m not ok. All I need to hear is “that’s f’d up but I’m here for you” not “dang I’m not the person for this have you tried to take pills?”Thank you for reading whoever this is P.s. I’m back to 150 it took awhile but I feel better in my body again!P.P.S sorry for the long rant;Hey everyone!

1c8jdz7;How can I get professional help if I’m afraid?;wsoups;For as long as I can remember I have always avoided reaching out for/ accepting help. This habit has stuck with me all the way up until now, and I’m starting to think that I’m never going to get better. My hesitance is rooted from mostly the fear of being rejected or just simply not being taken seriously, but looking at how the way my life is getting harder and harder to withstand, I’m afraid if I don’t ask for help, I’m going to end up past the point of no return.The most I’ve done is reach out to 3 friends, but nothing is really getting me the professional help I need. Im afraid to reach out to my parents because my previous attempts have just resulted in them downplaying my issues. They ask me if I’m okay all the time, but because of the way they treat my issues, I always avoid the topic. Even though I’ve already told a few people, I’m scared to tell them more because:1) I don’t want to burden them2) I don’t want to seem like I’m asking for attention3) I’m scared to even change because I’m so used to this feeling.I’m aware of how my reluctance to accept help is just making me feel worse and that’s why I need to do something, I just don’t know where to start due to my anxiety.

1c8j7ox;my ex’s manic episode;Alternative-Rub6623;Side note, he specifically had psychosis and bipolar disorder. I’ve never been with anyone with psychosis, but this didn’t affect me wanting to be with him either. Around 7 months into our relationship, he started getting these delusions of me cheating on him. For instance, he would pick me up from work, and believed I was giving all of my male co-workers head in the work bathrooms right before he picked me up. I reassured him and avoided every male to the best of my ability to help ease this wild assumption. I was also very open with him going through my phone since I had nothing to hide. Eventually he convienced himself so well I cheated on him, that he did it himself. He installed tinder and texted tens of girls. I let this go because I thought it was out of spite. Fast forward to his EPISODE. One night in our apartment he had a very serious talk with me saying he needed to protect me badly, from the other people in our apartment complex. He believed that they were all out to get me, and if I wasn’t in his sight that something bad would happen. I understood he was going through it at this time, so I just tried reassuring him. I woke up the next morning with him staring me down while I slept. It was a scary sight but deep down I know he’d never hurt he, he never has. I asked if he slept and he said “No, I needed to keep watch on you.” I tried insisting that he’d at least get a nap in. He switched his obsession of trying to protect me, to “saving other people”. This same morning, he drew his face black with a sharpie marker. When I asked him why he did this, he said he needed to “blend in with them”. Not sure if he meant African Americans or what. He put on boots, and a heavy coat, and kept a screw driver in his pocket. I asked what the screw driver was for and he said it was for self defense. He wanted to leave the house, and I tried reasoning with him on why he shouldn’t with sharpie all over his face and a screw-driver in his pocket. He cared about nothing I said and still left. While he was out his phone turned off, and others and I could not find anyway to reach him, and no one knew where he was. Over 24 hours later, turns out from a police report, he trashed his phone, and was running naked & barefooted on the highway with black sharpie still on his face. He ended up in a mental health crisis center immediately. He was there for a month of two, and I could only speak to him from the phone. This was 2 years ago, we are no longer together. He still tries to contact me saying he’s still in love with me and thinks about me everyday. I think about him too but I am not ready for this kind of relationship.;Side note, he specifically had psychosis and bipolar disorder.

She was manic bipolar and a very aggressive angry woman.My wife knows all of this about me in great detail. My wife and I are about to go through a divorce and I have been going through 12,000 text messages and have noticed that  some weird behavior from her for at least 6mo.

She has basically stopped caring about me in every way but sexually. She is very distant and emotionally unavailable. It feels like she is purposely causing fights and pushing me past my limit to create a fight with me until I breakdown and have basically ptsd episode.  and then she will text me later and use really odd language attempting to upset me and make me angry and tries to exaggerate the situation into something it’s not.  She knows I won’t hurt her.I am a stay at home dad of twin girls and I believe she’s been doing all of this to me for months because she doesn’t want to have to pay me spousal support after she divorces me.What type of crime is this?

She was a really bad alcoholic and I stood by her took care of her and after 8 years of marriage she’s trying to ruin my life.there’s at least three examples of this happening in the last 6months in text but  feels like she tried over 20 times to bait me into this exact tactic but it don’t work.I don’t know what to do I feel like she has caused me phycological trauma by purposely sticking around to cause fights then purposely text me to irritate.

1c8iyjl;How do I go on;jaydeweird;"TW: suicidality, CSA So I'm a 20 year old girl and I feel stuck. Things just can't seem to stay good and every year seems to get worse. The older I get, the more hopeless I feel. I want to believe the universe has a plan for me but it doesn't feel that way. I'm not going to kill myself. I don't have a plan and I've only ""attempted"" once. I put air quotes because I stopped myself during it and did no damage to myself. But if I don't kill myself, I don't know what I'll do. I just don't think I can cope with life. If life is always going to be a struggle then what's the point. For context: I've mental health issues for many years. My parents split up when I was three and my father is a bad parent. He was manipulative, he's narcissistic and neglectful. My mum is wonderful but she can only do so much. She's had a hard life and it just makes me feel worse about the odds of things getting better. When I was four, I was sexually assaulted by a pastor. Can't say much more because it's an on going investigation now and I don't remember much. The first time I had a panic attack was in year 2 I think. So I would have been 6 or 7. I also used to self harm as a child, although I didn't know what that was at the time. As I got older, things didn't improve much. Secondary school was a terrible time. I was constantly unwell because of how distressed I was. Symptoms included frequent headaches, fainting spells, stomach aches, nausea and one time, I could not walk for a week. Besides this, I had panic attacks almost every single day that I went to school. Some lasting hours upon hours. At the worst moments, I snuck a knife into school and was going to end it all. I wrote what read like a suicide note and sent pictures to my parents. My dad's only response was 'you sent them in the wrong order'. Baring in mind I numbered the pages. Throw in family drama, my brother's mental issues, financial struggles and typical teen stuff. Like hormones, being rejected and struggling to make friends. It was rough. By the time school finished, I had given up. I dropped almost all my subjects and only have 2 GSCEs to my name. I went to musical theatre college. It was my dream and it felt like the light at the end of the tunnel. However, I ended up hating it. I realised MT wasn't for me and quit. After that I tried to work but I've never held down a job for more than three months. I have ADHD on top of anxiety and depression. I'm very sensitive, easily overwhelmed and I find doing basic things like tidying the house exhausting. In recent years, I am now legally homeless. I was born and raised in the UK but moved to Jamaica temporarily to live with family last year. The house we were renting was put on the market and mum wanted to move back to her home country anyway. I was supposed to go back in February but due to financial issues and my grandparents declining health, I'm still here. I can't hold down a job, I have nowhere to live, I can't go to university (not that I ever wanted to) because I'd have to do an access course to get onto a foundation to then spend three or four years on a degree. It feels like I've dug myself in a hole and my life is ruined before it's begun. I feel myself becoming stressed at the incoming stress of my bleak future. I don't want to be strong anymore. I'm fighting right now for a life I no longer want. The careers I'm interested in are all inconsistent and difficult industries to get into. I write and I have a blog but it's not something I can make a living out of. I love to sing and act but I could not cope as an auditioning actor. My only family are my brother (and his son) and my mum. I have a handful of friends but they're broke uni students who live miles away so there's not much they can do. I have found options but I don't like any of them. I've become passively suicidal again. I just think about killing myself everyday. How much easier it would be if I were dead. I would feel guilty leaving behind the people I love and who love me which is why I won't do it. But resisting the urge is hard especially when I feel like I'm destined to have an unfulfilling life. What do I do? What would you do? Is there anything I haven't thought of? Anything would be appreciated. Advice especially.

His response was simply “your making that up, that stuff dosent happen to men.” It stung that he didn’t believe me. That event traumatized me. It changed me as a person.

1c8igxz;I want to get help for my mental health but my parents might kick me out .;Tough-Scientist6399;"Hey Reddit fam,I’m a 21-year-old black woman dealing with a lot right now – anxiety, slight depression, and I suspect I might have ADHD. Lately, I've been feeling like I'm not as productive as I used to be, and it's really taking a toll on my health and daily life.I'm considering talking to my GP about it at my next appointment, but there's a big hurdle: my parents don't seem to understand what I'm going through. They think I'm just being lazy and that getting a job would magically solve everything. But as anyone who's struggled with mental health knows, even simple tasks can feel overwhelming.Their response? ""That's white people shit."" They've never been supportive of my emotional needs, only focusing on the physical like financial stability which only do so much . I would rather be poor with love and support. I'm the first child, and despite struggling through school, they seem to expect me to suddenly find passion and motivation.The signs of ADHD are glaring, but they seem to believe I should just tough it out. I often feel like I'm not fully present, and it's affecting me deeply.But here's the catch: I'm afraid that if I seek help, I might end up without a home. They have a lot of control over me, and I've become dependent on them. I feel like I don't even think for myself anymore.I don’t have friends or family who can take me in, and everyone else is wrapped up in their own lives. I feel trapped.So, Reddit, what should I do?

1c8iaez;How to not feel like a failure when your mental illness seems to negatively affect every task or goal that you attempt to do/achieve?;OutrageousAccount815;Hello everyone. I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice or insight on this problem, particularly how it relates to school. I've failed countless classes and had to withdraw from others because I become so depressed or anxious that I don't go to class. Assignments pile up and I end up having to beg for extra time or cut my losses and fail. I can't help but feel that all of these professors think so low of me and that I truly may be just a person who is lazy hiding behind a facade of mental illness. I've seemingly tried everything that someone could think of to remedy this, therapy, medication, actively tried tools and tactics but it seems like the cycle doesn't end. Has anyone experienced this?

I hear them and I care that they care about me. But I do not believe them. Or attest I do not believe they actually know to the extent of how wrong they are. Either way. I do not want to keep wishing I looked better and felt better and lived better and loved people better and made more money and lived in a better environment and had more friends and felt more in-tune and was kinder and had more talent and had better hair and had better skin and everything else. When I can simply just remove myself from the lives of everyone around me and save them the sob story. I just want to delete my socials completely, isolate to the full extent and keep my sad life to my sad self. I see this hurting my boyfriend and that makes me sad.

1c8hvj2;Worried and unsure what to do;worriedWquestions;I was falling asleep scrolling when I read something about OCD and it sent me down a small rabbit hole and now I cannot sleep. Has anyone with OCD experienced these and does it seem like I could have it? - I do not believe any of these are detrimental to how I currently go through my day although they are everynow and then becoming worse. Long list so i will list the ‘main’ ones here thank you to anyone who can help. Some of the numbers are deleted since they were more clear and would give out personal info which I do not wantList : 1 , 3, 4 , 11 1) read online of other people having bugs okay into theirs, made me realize I have similar reaction to investation bugs like ants, fruit flies, roaches. (Reactions vary from, crying, feeling itchy, panicking, uncomfortable could last from an hour to most of the night). Had a bad experience with ants and broke down, (as a 16 year old boy) and after they were gone I slept on the end of my bed for a week, worried they crawl in my eyes, ears, or into my mouth then somehow live in me 2 ) unsure if it could be ocd or very bad paranoia, was very paranoid of the house being broken into all throughout high school, led to a breakdown once although I knew deep down no one was there, worry if I don’t do something something bad may happen (ie. someone’s calling but I don’t want to answer, but what if this is the last time I hear from them? I should answer incase) TW mentions of suicide and self harm3 ) after a breakdown from doing something horrible,  I suddenly turned strongly into religion after many years, then using it as an excuse to cut myself, believing that self punishment would aid in God forgiving me. (I still pray now but do no go into as deep thoughts, they come and go as I didn’t ‘finish’ my goal but I don’t partake. Didn’t kill myself as it would be too stressful on family and I would go to hell. Plus I believed I do not deserve the easy way out) 4 ) as a kid I had to find a rational. Chucky won’t kill me because he attacked a white teen boy. I was neither of those so he wouldn’t come for me. The movie saw stuck with me for a very long time because there was nothing to disconnect from myself, as he decided on what aspects he thought were correct. Negativity connected this to religion for a small time (has disconnected it now but cannot watch the movies without feeling uncomfortable and worry despite enjoying horror films and slashers) 5 ) may literally just be common sense??? But lately I cannot eat after work with feeling extremely uncomfortable if I do not clean my hands in some form. I think about how much I’ve touched throughout the shift and even after using germ x sometimes is not enough. Makes me loose my appetite unless I’m very hungry8 ) obsessive researching if I think something’s wrong (this being an example) 9 ) mom says this is ‘hard headed/obsessive’ but allegedly once I have an idea or am set on it I don’t let it go until it happens, even if I do not continue with it forever ( I do not agree, feels like dedication)10 ) had assumed this was common but after reading many people with OCD have felt like they were being watched constantly. Since I was a kid I imagined my crushes were in the vents of my home and could see me, so I’d do my best to look ‘cool’. Once an adult figure made jokes abt cameras being in the room so they knew when we weren’t sleeping and using our DS, up until the middle of high school I was convinced someone was recording me and I still have a fear of being recorded in public11 ) only ritualistic habit I’ve had (no longer is possible due to living in a dorm so was forced to stop) was covering the cracks in the bathroom , at first to make it hotter but then to prevent anyone from recording me through the cracks under the closet and bathroom door + when I sleep under the blanket I usually have to check multiple times someone is not standing there.

1c8hr7n;Lexapro, Wellbutrin, viibryd;Hot-Custard-1269;I started taking Lexapro at 10 mlg over a year ago. It gave me a bit of reprieve from anxiety and uplifted my mood. I did not have such intense mood flips throughout the day and overall was a positive. It did affect my libido however which in turn was affecting my relationship so a month ago my psychiatrist prescribed Wellbutrin. The past month has been rough. My anxiety peaked through the roof. Ive felt extremely irritable, almost rage at the slightest thing. My mood shifts throughout the day have been akin to when I’m not on meds and in general I’ve felt much more emotionally sensitive. My psychiatrist suggested I try viibryd, as it’s similar to Lexapro with a much lower risk of libido side affects.The crazy thing is even though Wellbutrin has made me feel awful the majority of the month the extra energy it gives me and the level of focus/clarity makes me not want to put it down. I’m realizing that Lexapro may of been making me feel slightly numb. I feel like I’m feeling again. This past week of taking it has been a bit better, but the added anxiety and irritation is still present. I don’t know much about viibryd. The process of medication change is exhausting and I’m hesitant to try it. Has anyone had similar experiences to above meds? What are your thoughts on viibryd?

1c8hifw;Just had a major breakthrough ;UndrThC;Backstory:My first boyfriend in high school was a world class douche. We dated for 2.5 years of the 4 years. He once asked out my cousin, he once told everyone he was going to break up with me, he gave me a promise ring but told everyone he was going to leave me if we lasted to senior year, he once told me that he was going on a band trip and wanted to break up for the weekend to see if he could have a chance with her, he once cheated on me, he always complimented other women but not me, he texted and flirted with everyone.Flash forward to now… ten years later… I am constantly so worried that my relationships will end that it ruins the relationship. I get so nervous that they will leave… even after small disagreements… and I make it a big scene. I get so nervous they will find someone better, that I build up the perfect girl for them in my mind. I get so nervous that think of other women more than me that I hate going in public where there are other women. I get so nervous that they will cheat (that I started cheating first so I couldn’t be hurt) that I am over paranoid about every notification on their phone or over conversation they may be having in person when I am not around. It’s why the mere thought of them leaving me or them emotionally cheating makes me break down.Here I am - 10pm sitting alone and getting high in our backyard, while he is inside and relaxing. I once again was toxic. I was once again just acting like everyone else who hurt him. Once again turning the tables on me. Once again being overly emotional. Over something silly. But that’s not how I saw in the moment. I was rethinking the situation over and was hit with a wave of emotions. I AM TOXIC. Being the psychologist that I am I began to ponder on why I am toxic, what from the past contributed to the mess that I am now. PSA. Don’t date while you’re still mentally and emotionally growing. I can’t lose this one guys. He’s the one. But I can’t stop despite how hard I try.

1c8guvc;Am I crazy?? Or just having a panic attack;WafflebatZ;Okay so call me crazy, but don’t actually, i get these moments usually when i’m thinking about food where i just sort of break down. I know I have an eating disorder but i kinda feel super over dramatic after the fact. When i feel like i ate too much in a day I start thinking about it in my head and i feel like I want to rip my entire body apart. Imagine you’re muscles and nerves are expanding inside you and they just can’t fit anymore, i think it’s like that. I pace around a room and I talk to myself about how messed up I am for eating that much and now I have to starve as punishment. But then I start telling myself to shut up like audibly and in my head. I feel insane in those moments. I grab my head I scream but without making a sound because god forbid my mom heard any this bullshit. It’s literally like those psycho people in movies grabbing there heads and flailing around like, well, psychos. I just had a moment like that literally five minutes ago and now i’m writing this in my bed still feeling a little crazy. I have this very strong and super unique and never before seen (not really) desire to be skinny and weigh less. I know really original, but i’m worried i’m going off my rockers a little bit. I don’t think i’m looking for any advice on how to feel better here or anything, maybe a little validation im not on my way to inpatient care. If i’m being honest I know i’m pretty deep into this because i don’t even want to get better. I play it up for my therapist and my mom that i’m eating well and feeling well but judging by the constant nagging in my head to stop stuffing my face, the guilt after eating anything, the constant body checking and the breakdowns over eating a few extra popcorns i’m not actually doing so swell. I do get the feeling these crazy moments are going to be more prevalent since summer is approaching, but anyways that’s all.;Okay so call me crazy, but don’t actually, i get these moments usually when i’m thinking about food ;Content Warning: Eating Disorders;1;1;2024-04-20 04:10:38;2024-04-20;Saturday;04:10:38;1882;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:14.635447
1c8gqww;I feel like quitting Discord for good since it’s been depressing me lately…;Neat_Ad_9669;"Lately I (25F) have been thinking about deleting Discord for good…Now don’t get me wrong, I it’s not necessarily a terrible platform and I personally had an amazing experience back when we were all in lockdown; I joined a handful of NSFW servers and made a ton of great connections. It really helped me feel less lonely during the pandemic, which was great and all. Now fast forward to 3-4 years later ….. I noticed myself yearning for superficial validation and often turning to Discord when I felt lonely, needy, or depressed. What seemed great and therapeutic in the past has now turned to a source of destruction in my life. In addition, I’d often get caught in some trivial drama with members of those servers, which would only worsen my mood…. Not to mention being used for sex and whatnot. Everyone knows how difficult it is for a woman to find genuine friendship on the internet due to the insane amount of perverts waiting to slide in your DMs…. But I feel like I’m partially responsible for that- I do flirt and occasionally seek ERP partners in said servers when I’m feeling horny and I honestly hate it! I just miss the old days when Discord was more of a hangout space for me to de-stress and all. Now it’s turned into a source of stress in my life and I just feel like quitting it for good. I’m almost 26 anyway and I can’t always expect the internet to be my source of outlet when things get stressful in my life….I just don’t know anymore.";Lately I (25F) have been thinking about deleting Discord for good…Now don’t get me wrong, I it’s not;Venting;0;1;2024-04-20 04:05:03;2024-04-20;Saturday;04:05:03;1455;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:13.327422

1c8fy5o;Non-disordered hallucinations? ;IAMREALLAIN;"I know someone who is very close to me who has had hallucinations for as long as they could remember. However, there is something very unusual about their hallucinations. It isn’t anything to do with the hallucinations themselves. It’s the fact that symptoms you would generally associate with hallucinations for any mental health disorder involving them (or neurological/physical health disorder) do not apply to this person. They are not delusional, emotionally unstable, withdrawn, cognitively disorganized, paranoid, or grandiose. They don’t have manic episodes. They don’t claim to be a medium or channeler. They also have the uncanny ability to perfectly distinguish their hallucinations from reality. They do have PTSD, but the hallucinations started before the trauma, and the hallucinations they have are not associated with the trauma in their content. Importantly, the emotional content of these hallucinations is not menacing or disturbing in nature. They describe them as emotionally and psychologically productive, because they use the hallucinations as information about what’s going on inside their head. They also aren’t so constant that theyre distracted with them; They function just fine and nobody would be able to tell that they hallucinate unless they said something about it.  Before anyone asks, yes; They have absolutely gotten mental health treatment, and essentially the hallucinations were such a non-issue that there was no reason to do anything about them. All they needed was talk therapy for PTSD and they manage without any psychiatric support today and are very happy. Does anybody know anything about this phenomenon?

1c8fhqg;A Letter to Life;Apimpettenamedlisa;I do think of death sometimes. Maybe more than often. Life feels burdensome, trying to keep up with everything happening. When asked why I'm always busy pursuing one thing after the other, I often laugh and say I want more out of life. But deep within me, I know nightmarish thoughts'd consume me if I were idle for a little bit. I've always lent a shoulder out, but I seem to have none to lean on. I've always been a light-hearted joker, so I know that no one would take me seriously [trust me, I tried once and regretted it]. Plus, I don't want to ever feel like a burden to anyone. I also know the way forward, but it's termed a sin. I've fasted, I've prayed, I've cried my heart out, but here I am. I just want to know that I'm on the right path.    But I feel tired like there's a never-ending load on my head. I used to have two people that I always thought about when these thoughts happened, to keep me grounded. Now, it's three—my beautiful boyfriend. My selfish part says he had a life before me and would be fine regardless. And the other part of me wants all the great things we've talked about – a home filled with joy and laughter and kids – from having our biological ones to adoption. I try every day to remember the good times I've had so far, the ones I never wish had ended. But it's always one thing after the other.     The start of the year was so harsh to me, and April has been unforgiving. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I am always to myself, and that seems like a problem in itself. I've always been a loner at heart – but extroverted in spirit and body, but it's getting tiring – it's as if I'm pretending, and I am tired of it. I am getting tired of being optimistic, of saying everything's going to be alright when it seems to be getting worse. I used to think I knew what the future held for me, but now I don't see anything. I just want something pain-free. Funny right? I hope that when the time comes, no one calls it selfish because I tried my hardest every day. Maybe I get something honorary in my memory – if people are to get past it. I also pray that time never comes and that I reach a state of ''it gets better soon''.

1c8f63y;I have had unexplained episodes for the past 10 years and would like answers.;rosiebuds420;I am a 19 year old female who has been struggling with something for years. I have considered many things and been to the doctor, but have instantly been brushed off and told it is a part of being a woman.For the past 10 years I have episodes on and off that last for about 30 seconds to a minute. These can happen as often as 10 times a day, or not happen at all for months at a time. During these episodes I feel intense deja vu, extreme fear, and my senses go wild. For instance, I will start smelling a very intense bad smell or tasting a bad taste. I also have complete amnesia after these have gone away and can’t remember what I was thinking about or what was happening during them. I cannot communicate during them besides saying one or two words to the affect of, “I can’t talk.” My brain goes blank while also somehow thinking every thought possible at once.I can’t attach images here but sometimes during these I have written things down, these usually include nonsensical words and feelings of fear and pain. For example: 1. corn on the cobb, primal escape, something done right, gate, sally packet twirling, ew, simon cowell, left side of face, eye droop, hurt hurt, neck hurt, pukey, im getting better, left side of face burnThat’s just one example of an episode but I have no idea what I was thinking of or what these mean after the fact. I often zone out during these, I don’t cry or breathe heavier I just zone out. Close friends and family sometimes don’t know they’ve happened until after the fact or if they try to talk to me during and I can’t understand what they’re saying or don’t respond.I don’t get them as often now, they come in waves. Sometimes they are quick flashes and other times they debilitate me and I become so disoriented that I don’t know what is going on. I have also had periods where I can’t sleep because of them because every time I fall asleep they happen.This has been very hard for me to research because the symptoms vary so much, sometimes I feel the deja vu more intense and other times it simply feels like a waking nightmare. I am fine right now and have definitely learned how to live with this, I simply want answers. When I went to the doctor she kind of cut me off and just told me I was bipolar and these are manic episodes but I truly believe that they are not. I’ve done a lot of research and while I will always value a medical professionals opinion, I just don’t think she understood what I was saying. Please help I know this sounds crazy!

1c8f37k;In This Hollow, I do Grieve - - For everything that's ceased to be;AvijeWitchyWoman;"Name's Jess. I'm a Mama, Wife(?), Cancer Survivor, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1; When I'm in a ""manic phase"" I usually need to be hospitalized. Not because I'm a danger to others - -   but Myself.I want to shed some light on what I've become and how I feel.. 2010: Nov. 27.. I walk into my Mother's house, after a mini stay at Table Rock Lake. I notice my brother's bedroom door is literally split down the middle & it fucking hits me harder than anything...He had hung himself..with his own guitar strap.. I didn't make a sound, I walked slowly up to where my baby brother lay..Cold. Stiff. He was only 24, but I remember sitting next to him, trying to keep my composure because our Mother was about to need every bit of my support..In those next moments, it seemed everything went to slow motion and  I remember brushing his long hair out, and saying to what was left of my brother- - ""They sure did a number on you little bro."" He looked as if he'd aged 60+ years.. that's what his demons, and own darkness had done to him.I can't describe the feeling I was having. What snapped me out of it? The sound of our Mother's gasp as she came in his room.. I looked up to her with my eyes swelling & said ""He's gone Mama..""    She immediately fell to her knees, and I watched as our poor Mother let out the most universal (almost primal) call of grief; begging for her son to wake up.   That was the most heart shattering and soul distressing thing, I have ever witnessed/heard.   A universal language of Grief.   A Primal call of a Mother's Heart and Soul truly breaking. It is one of those moments that I will NEVER forget; sometimes wishing I could.   Our Father... he was the same, calling to his boy... Goddamn ya'll; my only living sibling (i am the eldest of 2 boys & 2 girls) all my younger siblings have died.. But, I still have Jason. He is the 2nd eldest. So - - the 2 eldest kids, are living while the babies..are gone.Is Grief.   This is where my Downward Spiral begins....Fast forward to 2020 - - A decade passes, it hurts no less.  March 8 of 2020 - - My sister, Christina (Chris for short) also takes her life..in the exact same way my brother had.. I can't even type out because her children were in the goddamn house.   Her little boy said something that will fucking haunt me forever .. ""Mom's dead.""  (((That's 2 of my younger siblings))Next year, 2021 the baby of our circle..Tami was 31.   3-fucking-1..she was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of Breast Cancer, that had made its way to her liver in less than 6 months time.   They tried chemo, she had a terrible reaction to it.. 3 days later she died with her husband and 3 kids with her. Her liver had fucking failed.   Now, you're starting to understand why I feel this numbness, excruciating and overwhelming darkness as I allow myself to lay in this hollow, or drown in those currents..   I was going through my own cancer treatments, I was almost done too - - - -  Then..(I am literally fighting back burning, salty tears trying to get this out)   My Portal into this world; My life-giver and my first and truly only fucking best friend, My Mother.  What we thought was Lymphoma, was Small Cell (Extensive) FUCKING lung cancer. When I got to that hospital, she was on a ventilator, in ICU.   The ominous walk down that hall, to where the ICU was, will forever be my ""liminal space,"" and the longest, most difficult walk I will have ever taken.   With every step, I felt another piece of me dissipate, leaving me weak & lost. It was because of my last living sibling, Jason, that I made it down that wretched space.   The next 3 days, I sat by her bedside.. taking in every single detail of her beautiful face, fearing I would forget it.   She couldn't speak, her left lung was completely covered with this shit cancer.  I'd stare at her for hours with tears in my eyes, while she could not verbalize- - Her eyes. Her crystal clear blue eyes, said all I needed to know.   I knew she wasn't scared. She knew who was waiting for her. She looked at me for the last time, and blinked 3 times. (.)

You are needed. If you think otherwise, then think back at your life. Was there anyone you helped for no reason, once in your life? They probably still think about you! Was there anyone you ever complemented a while ago? They might still remember you! If you do not find love around you, push further. Push through the bad and negative thoughts. Think happy things! Love yourself! Because of you die, or bring harm to yourself, no one will be happy. It brings no good to do something that will negatively impact your health and happiness! So every time you think about suicide, or something maybe even worse, just know: we are here. Me, and all these random people on the internet, are all rooting for you.

1c8epm8;Is there any way for me to reach out to a professional for free and receive guidance?;Massive_Whereas8014;I'm trying to help me friend get better mental health. It's complicated, but what I've gathered over the last few months can be boiled down to this: She has multiple major stressors in her life, some self inflicted, she has social anxiety, and she really can't open up to people very easily, im really the only exception. I've worked the last 6 months or so and have successfully gotten her into therapy/ seeing mental health professionals, but she routinely talks about how she can't really open up to them all that much and discuss what she discusses with me. She has been very suicidal in the past, I mean if we put it on a scale of 1-10 then she was a 9/10 and sometimes a 10/10, she's harmed herself in the past, she almost did take her life a few times, and lazily attempted to hang herself at one point not entirely trying.She is less suicidal now, but does rarely mention it still, and its clear that she has those thoughts only when she begins to think about all of the stressors in her life. One of them being that she doesn't really have any plans or major interests for a job in the future, that she doesn't want to go to college, but ther mom has said that if she doesn't then she'll kick her out. However, we both are 16. I've told her to try and focus on some of her other challenges in life right now and find a solution to that later when her mental health is better, but she doesn't/ hasn't listened. I've advised her to try and talk to her therapist about it, but she has social anxiety and has said that she really can't open up to her super easily.She is better than she was 2 months ago, but now it seems like her mental health is plateuing, and not while it's good yet. She doesn't seem to be getting much better anymore, and if anything, it seems like she temporarily dips back down to the low she used to be at at times. I just can't convince her to push herself even a little out of her comfort zone and start to get better, she always wants to do what's easiest for her to do rather than what's best. No amount of encouragement, reassuring, sternness, confidence, explaining, experience, nothing, nothing seems to be enough to convince her. And at this rate, it's starting to drag me a little bit. When she was at her all time low, I felt awful, and I've bounced back a lot recently, but now it seems like I'm at a dead end and falling down a hole. So I just want to find a professional who can give me advice and new things to try, because making all the decisions on what to do and say is exhausting by now.;I'm trying to help me friend get better mental health.

1c8epgq;My marriage is falling apart with 5 week old baby and PPD/PPA/OCD;blueberryriot;I’m 5 weeks postpartum. I’ve been struggling with PPD / PPA and have pre-existing OCD. This episode started about 4 weeks ago. My husband and I have always had major fights, horrible fights but they were never violent, and we were always able to work through them. We had been on a good path before I gave birth. A path I thought was finally the place we were trying to make it to with each other. For the first 2 weeks of my PPD / PPA he was good. Tried his best to support me. It was me who was slightly mean, distant, overly anxious, maybe unbearable at times. But never did I scream or break things, or watch him sob and beg for me to stop and just keep yelling, tearing him apart, with no mercy or empathy. But that’s what the past week has been for us. This week I agreed to start medications and have been actively taking them for the past two days. That was a huge step for me. But even after that we’re still having explosive fights night after night. The other night it got so bad, I panicked so hard on the floor, sobbing, dissociated, the lowest point I’ve ever been. I thought about our life together, our sweet baby and how guilty I felt that this is what his parents had become. I thought about how I had given this man everything because I loved him so much and how without our family, I would be alone in this world. And I thought about how alone I felt anyways and I was still in our home. I have no support, no friends, no family. I thought about how everyone is just better off without me. I thought about how it seemed like my only option was to drive full speed into a tree, and how that wasn’t an option either because I have a baby who deserves more from me than that. I sobbed on the floor as he ate chips in the living room, unbothered by my pain after screaming and screaming me into a panic attack, telling me I’m a liar, just mentally ill, to get the fuck out of our house, that he can’t stand me and he hit the wall before leaving. The next fight, was him screaming at me in the living room, triggered by the small anxiety attack I had and asking him to help me. He said he needed to get away from me and he left to his father’s for hours, once again leaving me a mess sobbing in the living room, begging for help. For empathy. For a shred of care. The next morning when I was still raw, he was upset I hadn’t moved on. So I gave in and moved on. Today, I was having a good day. The first good day in a long time. Then I got nervous about using sheets on a bassinet mattress that weren’t specific to that bassinet and asked my husband if there was any reason to think it isn’t safe. I asked if he knew anything about why they add that warning to the product, was there anything to be concerned about (stupid I know, but I want to be sure my baby is as safe as can be.) He snapped at me, saying I was berating him and if I didn’t trust his opinion then don’t ask at all instead of asking dumb questions 4 times in a row. I was hurt, and walked away. He followed and continued to say this was my fault, and that he isn’t letting me cause problems and then blame him anymore. I eventually even said it was my fault, I was sorry and I stopped responding all together. He continued talking at me about what I do wrong, relentlessly while I held our sleeping baby. Then he brought my dinner to me and I said I wasn’t hungry. He went ballistic. I asked him to stop yelling and so he raised his voice to a scream to “show me what screaming was.” I heard crashing and thuds in the living room as he screamed and tossed our things around. Saying this is such bullshit and he can’t take it anymore, he’s just such a “horrible person he guesses” and that I’m insane, that he’s done. Once he had reduced me to sobs, when I had remained calm all the time prior, he said he was done and I was on my own tonight and he left to go to his dad’s. This was all with my newborn laying in my arms. I truly feel my husband no longer loves me. I don’t know how you can see someone you are suppose to love so upset and falling apart like that and just continued beating them down. See them hit their lowest point, beg for empathy and then just leave them there to cry it out, saying they’re “doing it for show.” I don’t know what to do. I love my husband, I want my son to have a loving household, and my husband was so different before this. Everything was so good before, and now he’s scaring me and making me feel I’m not cared about anymore. I feel like my only option is to leave, but I don’t know how to do that with a newborn. I don’t know where we’ll go or how I’ll care for him alone. I don’t know if I can leave the home with my newborn legally, but I won’t leave him behind. I don’t know what to do.;I’m 5 weeks postpartum. I’ve been struggling with PPD / PPA and have pre-existing OCD.

1c8eef7;Is my therapist wrong?;Alarming_Bag_562;I have bipolar disorder and I’ve been seeing my therapist for three years or so. It’s been an okay experience. I’ve acknowledged that she may not be the best therapist for me as she was looking at jobs for me while I was unemployed (I had to go on abilify because I was such a wreck, so not the emotional support I needed.) A few months ago she mentioned that I might have a personality disorder (did not specify which one, leaning borderline). She told me to ask my psychiatrist. I asked my psychiatrist and the psychiatrist said I did not have one. I told my therapist that my psychiatrist said I don’t have one. My therapist then asked some follow up questions that left a bad taste in my mouth (is your psychiatrist a psychiatrist or a nurse practioner? Do you see your psychiatrist weekly or monthly?). I’d bring up what she said in sessions every week and she said “yeah you bring it up every week that’s interesting…” In my head I’m thinking “BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG DEAL.” I tried to tell her I painted a clear picture to my psychiatrist as to why my therapist had those concerns but she didn’t seem to buy it. I also don’t know why I feel the need to make my therapist buy it.I told my therapist I feel like we’re at an impasse because she’s talking to me like she’s talking to someone who has a personality disorder even though she’s been presented evidence that I don’t have one. She acknowledged that I don’t meet the dsm-5 criteria but she sees patterns in me that she’s had with other clients. I told her she was being biased and she said “maybe I am.” Is it weird for a therapist to be biased in favor of a personality disorder with this much evidence against it? Is it also weird for her to acknowledge a bias like this?

1c8edsu;Undiagnosed does not equal invalid. ;Apprehensive_Ball478;I am just reminding everyone here that a diagnosis does not define whether you deserve support or not. You can being struggling with your mental health and not have a diagnosable mental disorder and that is completely valid. You don’t need to let your mental health define you. Just because you are having a hard time now does not mean it is who you are. And you deserve support whether you feel like your problems are “bad enough” or not. Whether that’s through therapy or family or friends , etc. And if you do have a diagnosis do not let that consume you and make you feel like your life is destroyed. You may have to work harder than other people and have more struggles but that doesn’t take away your potential. You are still the same person. Your trauma or diagnosis or mental health does not define who you are as a person. It can change how you act and appear for a while or maybe forever but you are still the same person.

I'm currently overseas but will have to return home soon to live with her again, which fills me with dread as I don't think I can take the toxic environment anymore. I've lost my will to work or improve my situation.

1c8dpxj;Is it normal to have the level of sympathy I have?;Colton_Champion;Hey. so recently i’ve been questioning my morality after a few events and evaluating how i feel about them. Recently my friends’s mom / my mom’s friend passed away and my mother walked into my room with the news, about to cry, and all i could do was say “oh okay, dang, that’s awful.” The person who died was also my teacher about 6 years ago and i didn’t feel like crying in the slightest. yeah it sucks but i wasn’t sad one bit even though everyone else is feeling awful about it. and today, some of my friends decided to mess with me by passing forward a hoax as a joke about some girl who supposedly died on my sports team while participating in it, and trampled by spiked cleats. they were just joking but when they said it to me at first seriously i couldn’t help but say “What!?” and reacted shocked of the absurdity of the story. I didn’t feel sad but questioned the validity of it with no regard to the potential that it could be true. Afterwards One girl told me that they were “Testing my sympathy” and told me i was “asympathetic”A few other things like me not feeling sorry for my brother for having to take shots everyday also are having me question if i have a good morality or sympathy for others.

1c8djrk;What could be happening?;missgentle;Long post:I’m trying to figure out what could be happening with my sibling.Background: They had problems as a teen. Acting out etc. dropped out of school. Looking back I can imagine they probably had depression. No mental incidents that stand out.They entered a relationship at 17. Still in that relationship/ almost 40 now.In those years they didn’t have much to do with family. Only our mother who paid their rent and or bills a lot or at least helped with money even though they did work.Our parents died over 11 years ago.For the majority of that time I probably only seen that sibling less than 15 times. In the beginning I searched for them, reached out, looked for them. I honestly thought we would get closer after the loss.At one point I went to their house, they had moved out months before.They never reached back out or contacted me.They may have called sporadically but basically I cried a lot about but was forced to accept they didn’t want to be around me.3 yrs ago they reached out that they had cancer. I offered to drive them to appointments. Do laundry shop whatever i could to help. They did not let me do anything. They had chemo radiation.At this time only came to 1 invited holiday. A few calls to me thats about it.Dec 2023 they called to come over. Showed up with the devastating news that they had to have double upcoming surgery for very damaged bones due to radiation.I went to the hospital with them on surgery day. When nurses came in i heard the nurse mention methadone. I didn’t say anything. More nurses came in sibling asked me to step out.After the surgery i spent time in the hospital with them. They ended up telling me that they had been on heroin after parent death but clean  last 6 plus years.They said they were happy they shared that with me. I was shocked but just listened.We spoke a few more times over the next month. ThenEverything changed. They found out that their cancer had returned. During that hospital stay they entered into some sort of episode and have not come out of it.I can only describe it as a long manic episode. Now it feels like they are schizophrenic.At this point they had started a antidepressant that had been in their system about 8 weeks. They were getting up early was happy for the first time in years. so happy. I felt like this is exactly what they needed before their surgery. But after the cancer diagnosis and change, I’m scared of them.The very first day I noticed they were off. They text me after we had chatted that morning and asked me what I wanted. They said” tell me anything you want and I’ll get it for you. They said they knew the secret to life. “An hour of texting and then making no sense I told him I would talk to them later .They have not returned to their “normal “ self in 3 months.You can no longer have conversations with them. One second they are crying and the next second they are telling you they started a business. They are telling you that someone offered them $500 for their shirt. They are telling you they are suing three different people , they are telling you they are going to have a baby and get married. They are going on a cruise.Everybody you see on the street is their best friend. They know them from somewhere. People sitting at bus stop. They know them they know their story. You can’t have a conversation because they never let you get a word in. Never a word in hours.If you say I have three of this. They answer they have four. But the part that’s the scariest is the stories.I don’t know if they know they’re lying or they are delusional. I received a call from them and they got home from work. They were locked out. I offered to come get them. They said no that their significant other was on the way with the key. They said I’ll talk to you later. Everything was good. The significant other called me a few hours later crying.They had indeed arrived at home with the key. Only to find my siblings, standing in the driveway with no pants and no shoes. Their car was missing. They didn’t know where it was. They told me my sibling could not have been at work because they no longer had a job. That the job was very concerned about what was happening with them and they could not come back to work. Their behavior was scaring customers.Apparently, the night before my sibling had went to a concert. Went to the merch booth and started selling the merch, even though they had no connection to the band. They were asked to leave because they were accused of stealing they made a huge scene and left. They got back home but had no idea where the car was. Friends that went with them that night now no longer want anything to do with them.Fast-forward a few months, this is nonstop.I am so scared and sorry for them to have now multiple returning cancer. I live in fear of getting a call that they have passed away. They no longer bathe and I can’t hold a conversation with them. No one can.Significant other called 911 to try to get help for them, but in our state, they don’t hold you just because a loved one is concerned about you. You have to go get help.Everyone has told them to get help and they will not do itNow they also lash out on top of everything else.What could possibly be happening with them. In the beginning, I thought the antidepressant maybe caused a bipolar episode. I read some stuff about that actually happening to otherIt seems worse than bipolar seems schizophrenicI don’t know what to do. You can’t force them to get help but i can’t handle watching them spire out of control this way.I am completely stressed out for it. I can’t imagine that their life ended up this way. I’m so sad.If they don’t want to get help. There is nothing we can do at least in our state.I don’t even want to be around them and I feel horribly guilty about it. My significant other told me I have nothing to feel bad about.But honestly, I do feel better because I wish they had never come around like this. I wanted their relationship so bad and now I can’t even talk to them.I loaned them rent money the last couple months and found out they never paid their rent. I feel just done. I can’t handle this.What can possibly have happened to them. Can you be in total shock and lose your mind finding out you have cancer?Is it shock? Is it bipolar schizophrenic? What the heck happened to my sibling?;Long post:I’m trying to figure out what could be happening with my sibling.Background: They had prob;Content Warning: Addiction / Substance Abuse;0;1;2024-04-20 01:16:51;2024-04-20;Saturday;01:16:51;6324;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:13.340942

I don't know how to use the bus lines and no one around me knows how to either, but I'm planning on asking a social worker whenever I can but idk when that will be.I work 6 minutes away but it's a couple of miles so I can't walk and my school Is a couple of miles away so I can walk, well I guess I theoretically could. Would that be unrealistic? I can't ask my parents for anything like an extra ride to pick up my medications (but my medications cannot be delivered so I end up just not picking them uphalf the time) every month I beg my mom for a ride to get them because the pharmacy is 3 miles away. And It takes a few weeks until she gives in and I just know they hate me over there. They keep complaining about having to give me rides rightfully so. They will cuss me out or huff and puff. They have always complained about having to feed me or buy me clothes growing up. I am so sick of living.I do understand that no one is entitled to care about me anyways so I'm looking for advice to do everything myself.The other day my dad picked me up from school and he was crying and I'm like why are you crying and it's because he is sick of having to drive me to school, and he is sick of having to work. I am considering dropping out after this semester. Even if I get a car, car insurance will be $500 for my age and I won't be able to afford it. I have no credit to lease a car. If I buy a used car it will probably break down and then total and the repair would cost more than the car. If I got a bike I know that shit will get stolen.  on a part time job and I already struggle working part time with school anyway, so working full time and school will kill me. I already struggle with being able to function and wake up everyday, and with taking care of myself. I haven't brushed my teeth in 2 weeks.  If I work full time at my job i will make about $2,400 a month before taxes and because I know I wouldn't be able to survive on my own without multiple jobs anyway that's why I haven't worked full time yet. I'm trying to get jobs in walking distance but no one is hiring me. My bed has been broken for 6 months and I can't even go to sleep. If it's not one thing it's another. I am so tired of existing.I have struggled with suicidal ideation for years but I'm planning to actually take my own life by the end of the year if it doesn't get better, or if I don't get better, because I know in reality everything that is happening to me is really my fault.;F19 cant drive yet because I can't afford a car or driving lessons yet it'll probably be months/ a c;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-20 01:14:56;2024-04-20;Saturday;01:14:56;2788;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:13.342841

I’ve been fairly certain for years that I have anger issues, but recently I’ve been noticing more and more how my actions are affecting the people around me. I wasn’t always disrespectful and selfish, which I am admittedly now, but because of this I’ve been realizing I’m likely an awful person to be around. I’m not asking for people to excuse my actions or tell me how to feel better, I just want to get better. I’ve tried to have patience but it’s almost like I have no control over myself when I get passionate. (It’s not just negativity, it’s also when I’m excited, but that’s not really important) I’ve also had many recent experiences that have made me feel perceived as just evil. I could explain my justifications for each situation, but I feel that it happens too much for it to always be able to get justified.I also admit I have almost zero drive to do anything, like at all. I know that affects the people around me. I feel like many of the people I’ve hurt will never forgive me, and I want to be ready (but I’m not) to accept that. They don’t really owe me anything.Anyways I’m fairly confused about myself but very aware I need a change.

My school system said to me that if my parents don’t transfer me to another set of services for psychiatric assistance they might intervene by contacting higher level board members of my school. And possibly conduct a lawsuit against my family for Cancellation of these services. I need support and feedback about what you guys think.What do i do about this? Where should I stand?

1c8bdkx;Rough take on my mental state for the past years;Quiteevil1;So here’s a little window into my head. I don’t know what’s wrong with me really. I just know that there is something that’s not right in my head. I’m not diagnosed with any mental illness besides ADHD, but I feel like that can’t be the only problem. I’m not diagnosed with either depression or anxiety, but I know that I “in waves” have problems with both. I just feel so worthless all the time. I always need validation. I feel like I'm never enough. Then there can be times where I feel good, and at those times I could barely even try to describe these problems because I kinda don’t “remember” them if that makes sense. I usually don’t write stuff down, but I felt like this was the time to do so, and was hoping I could find someone to relate to.Most of the time I feel really lonely even though I have people around me like my family and friends, but it’s like I push them away anyway. Almost like I like being lonely even though I hate it. The same with being sad. It’s like it’s easier to feel sad than any other emotion. There is a lot more to it, but I think this is enough.I’m not one to post a lot on Reddit so I'm sorry if I wrote this in some wierd way.But as I said, I just hope I can find someone to relate to and someone who could understand.EDIT: If you want to share your own experience;So here’s a little window into my head.

However, on the flip side, if someone wrongs me, I find it incredibly challenging to forgive and forget, particularly if their actions have far-reaching consequences or create a butterfly effect of headaches in my life.This dichotomy has left me feeling perplexed and seeking insights from others who may have experienced similar struggles. Does anyone else find themselves in a similar predicament?

1c8b0b1;Is it common to only realise as an adult that you were an unhappy child?;georgemillman;I'm 30, and until very recently I've thought my childhood was relatively happy. I had some difficult periods, including a bout of depression in my early teens, but generally I've never felt like I carried much childhood trauma.But, various things recently have made me realise that actually, I really wasn't happy as a kid at all. In fact, I was pretty mentally unstable most of the time, even at times that I thought were good. It's been quite a shock realising this, but overall it's a very positive realisation - up until now, I've thought that the various mental health struggles I've had at points have just been an inherent part of being me, and now that I've been able to contextualise certain things, put them in perspective and accept that they weren't my fault, it makes me feel able to put them behind me. Yeah, it sucks that I wasn't as happy growing up as I should have been, but I still have the majority of my life ahead of me and now I know that I have the potential to make that a lot happier. Since realising these things, I've felt more mentally stable and in control than I ever remember feeling before.Do many people get this? To be clear, I'm not talking about repressed memories - I haven't suddenly recalled anything I'd blocked out. I've just come to realise that I was a lot less happy than I'd thought I was, and what the reasons for that were.;I'm 30, and until very recently I've thought my childhood was relatively happy.

They do and I accept we start talking and everythings great till I get tired of them and ghost them. If not that I'll find a way to ruin it and only see the effects of  my actions, when it's over and how hurt I'll be when they leave. All possible relationships ended in the talking stage.Physical intimacy is also something I suffer with I only feel confident enough to do stuff like kissing when I'm drunk, never had sex (been close) but I just kinda don't feel confident.My biggest fear is that they'll hurt me, I'm not good enough or one day they'll wake up and think I'm not pretty enough and other stuff like that.

1c89xvd;tips for always feeling like I'm getting in trouble;throwaway25833753;After a series of events in the last 3 years (culminated in several breakdowns and a suicide attempt) I've developed a severe anxiety around keeping my job and getting in trouble at work.I am doing much better now and just recently began to feel back to my old self. However, I am constantly worrying that I'm doing things and going to get in trouble, even though these things that could get me in trouble, are genuine mistakes on my part. sometimes these fears are not substantial, but often I say things that would be oversharing/being overly opinionated and only realise after the situation has occured that I've done it. this results in me having awkward conversations with superiors at work that make me feel embarrassed. this has happened so many times I feel it is a flaw in me and if I could fix it I can alleviate my anxiety about losing my job as I won't be making these mistakes anymore, thus not having awkward conversations that make me feel upset/as though I need to leave the job.I try to think before I speak but sometimes what seems right in the minute, I then realise wasn't the right thing after the event/in hindsight. I'm just wondering if anyone would have any tips on how I can combat this, either the feeling overall or how to work on oversharing and being overly opinionated? I've just started a new job and I really want to do well at it but I'm so worried this could jeopardise that as i did it on my first day and fear i already did it again even though I didn't mean to. this is a job where it is important to keep personal information private and separate from the people I am working with.I'm sorry if this isn't an eloquent/easy to follow post. this is the first time I've put into words how I feel about this.thank you for reading this far and thanks in advance for any responses, I will read them all  :);After a series of events in the last 3 years (culminated in several breakdowns and a suicide attempt;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-19 22:29:13;2024-04-19;Friday;22:29:13;1838;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:14.560124

I have not much about me other than gossiping, sex jokes and just being genuinely random (which is what most teenagers are, right?)But the problem is this disconnect with others is driving me insane- but it really shouldn’t matter right? Ever since I was a child, I never had much love from my mum, only my dad babying me and teasing me all the time. And as I grow, I start to feel needy for attention, especially as a child I always wanted everyone to notice me. I especially peaked when people would notice my talent for art.problem:However, this present moment I’ve been behaving so shamelessly and  unhinged to the point people laugh out of nervousness and disgust. I know my behaviour is bad as I reflect a lot -telling myself to improve the next day- but I don’t. My behaviour isn’t god fucking awful bad, just me being generally inappropriate. But I can’t help it- I try to shut my mouth and keep talking, but I feel like I must keep talking. Otherwise people will find me boring, right? After this inappropriate speech occurs, I immediately switch to self-loathing and hate myself for acting like this, I  dissociate with my identity (usually daydreaming me as the perfect person as a coping mechanism).In the back of my mind, I can sense my rational thinking telling me to stop, however I can’t.

I achieved full/top marks in every subject without even trying. Only when it came to around my first few tests of y11 did I ever start studying. I studied half heartedly to achieve a average point score of 8.3 on my mocks, got accepted into all the sixth forms I applied to (conditional offers), and have been told that I'm over the half way line and now all I need to do is finish the race (with my real gcses). The problem is, I've stopped caring. I mean like, I know its important, I'm a logical thinker, I understand that I cant fuck this up for myself, I try to study because I know how much I might not know, but at the end of the day, my body feels nothing, its all word trains, thoughts, running through my head on an infinite treadmill, infinite motion with no displacement. Most of my thoughts feel like that.I have no work ethic. I cant study properly for shit. I have no drive or motivation to complete anything that's supposedly important, in fact, nothing feels important. I complete my assignments because I don't want afterschool detentions, but even when I get those, they just don't really feel like they matter. I mean why would they? I just sit there and kinda stare into space thinking about whatever I wanna think about, its not like they force me to do something I don't wanna, in fact, what I do in a detention is not so different from what I do in my own free time, except normally I think deeply while listening to music and playing some random shooter game that I just happen to be the amazing at for no apparent reason.Working out doesn't feel the same either. Ive completely stopped working out and for some reason just continue to be strong. I do some pullups every now and then on the bar through my door, and for some reason I've stayed the strongest in all my friendgroups, once again, for no apparent reason. Now that I think about it, I've just continued to get stronger. I was struggling quite a bit to do one arm pullups just before I stopped working out consistently; Recently I tried to do one again, and somehow I just... can? I can just do them now?? for no reason whatsoever? I mean like I didn't even try? What am I being rewarded for?I feel unalive at home, not dead. My thoughts still run, but I only really feel alive with friends. i love my family and everything, but there just isn't much to do at home, I'm not allowed out much, so I'm just stuck with my PC for videogames and youtube, working out, and studying. I used to play many videogames competitively with large friendgroups. Fully invested proper 12 hours every day (I didn't have to study back then and had all the free time in the world) and all i can say is i miss those times. Im hoping i can do all that again after gcses.I feel way more alive at school, or really just anywhere outside. I love being around my friends, i feel happy for no reason around them. i get tired by myself and feel energised around people. I love doing random guy shit with my friends. I love talking to people during class. I love asking the teachers stupid questions and taking the lesson on a tangent. I love talking to substitute teachers about life. I love talking to adults in general. I even love getting in trouble. I believe there'll never be another time in my life again where some old underqualified computer science teacher will pull me out of a lesson telling me off for laughing too much in class with my friends, so i must cherish it as a memory every time it happens. I like to say ""detentions are temporary, memories are forever."" It's even funnier because all the teachers that get pissed at me at the end of the day have to write that i got 8/9s (A - As) on my report card at the end of the day, I just imagine their blood boiling as i achieve high grades completely disrespecting them every term lmaoooo. I love being a male as well. I love wrestling with my friends, being grabbed by my feet by somebody a foot taller than me and being turned up side down. I love having a football kicked directly at my face, the sting, the energy, the comedy as i get up off the floor and chase down whoever did it. I feel so alive with male people. I love the simplicity of the happiness of being male.I feel like everyone around me is a kid. I am 16, i am the same age as everyone else, but sometimes it feels like i intentionally dumb myself down in order to have fun with them. I don't mind it, i love being stupid and careless with my boys, it makes me feel happy to feel like a kid... being a kid loll, but when it comes to talking to adults, I feel a slight bit more tapped into my soul. Its like i kind of wake up or take a mask off. I love talking about the cost of living crisis, whether or not the world is run by a shadow government, the gender dysphoria issues in the west, religious views and my personal beliefs. Obviously i joke around with adults too, but its definitely on a much more mature level than with my friends. Its to a point at which i realise when i fuck about talking with a substitute teacher my friends very clearly phase out of the conversation, with it just being what feels to me like an ordinary discussion about whatever, but after its over my friends make a joke about how its ""so interesting listening to a podcast between two adults"" or tell me that they ""didn't understand anything we were talking about."" like i get we're kids but really? i don't even read the news, so everything i talk about was just picked up off of social media, and had a little bit of common sense applied to it. An example would be why a dictatorship might be beneficial to third world countries who suffer at the hands of first world countries who run them as puppet states. Or maybe a discussion about how incredible it is that middle eastern countries manage to keep what are practically slave migrant workers so in line and their crime rate so low, compared to the uk that can't control stabbings on the street every night. Its whatever, just makes me wonder if somethings wrong with me. I get the same thing from parents, my mum always tells me about how other kids parents are so impressed with me or how they think i speak so maturely, when in reality all i did was.. talk.. like a normal human being? yeah its odd.Where was I? oh yeah, the odd stuff now. I've developed to become a bit of a sexist. maybe a lot. It's not really on purpose, i just kinda learned it. I feel like i should clarify that I have moved between 7 separate schools numerous times within 16 years of my life, making friends and losing friends in all of them, so i feel i am more than qualified to speak about trends in friendship groups, separation, attachment, and all that fun stuff. No male has ever brought issues to my life. All the issues in my life have only ever been brought to me by women. Arguments, misunderstandings, friendship issues. I have never once argued with a male friend, i love my boys more than anything honestly, id trust more than 20 people (all guys) with my life. I find that guys in one year group all just love each other, some may have single issues with each other, but when it comes to being in a group, its all put aside, and even between the two beef is normally very easily settled. Guys always protect each other from getting in trouble with teachers, they never rat each other out. If you couldn't tell by now, i just have this incredible pride and love in being a male and having male friends. Even when it comes to them actually fighting, all arguments made and issues brought up are always extremely logical. Everything just makes sense, guys are no bullshit people.I want to clarify that there are some outliers with what I have described above, but they normally aren't accepted as men and are usually shunned... for convenience purposes.When it comes to girls, i see that they normally love to hang in their little exclusive groups of maximum 5 and act as if they're better than everyone else. I see that they love snaking on people they claim to be friends with and always seem to be chatting shit behind someones back. I used to have many, many female friends, but as time went on they were just too much effort to stay in touch with (after moving so much) and I've found that they just don't really serve any real purpose in my life.  With guys i can call them up after months and we'll talk as if we just spoke yesterday. Girls require energy and effort, and tbh are quite boring. Like i don't really want to hear about the 4 guys you've ran through while i haven't spoken to you in 6 months, tell me about your family, tell me about your grades, lets talk over some lunch, lets go shopping, why do i need to know drama between people i haven't interacted with in years, ykwim? with guys it isn't even a real conversation half the time, we might hop onto a game and just make stupid little jokes for 5 hours straight, don't know this guys relationship status, don't know if his hot sister is still alive or not, shit, i don't even know what country this guy lives in anymore, but i know he's my boy and that's all that really matters at the end of the day. Female arguments also feel like they're over the most random silly unnecessary bullshit. I just cant respect a group of people who find it so difficult to love the people around them and fith over silly things like not saying happy birthday or not looking good.I also just want to quickly critique female teachers. They just seem to get tilted so much quicker, and have so much less control over a classroom. Male teachers always stay a bit looser, allowing a little bit of whispering while still managing to conduct a good lesson, keeping everything light hearted and funny even when they need to tell somebody off, often just saying their name and receiving silence. Female teachers often have to command respect more directly, and seem to be lot more on edge than male teachers. I do love some of my female teachers very very much, many of them are extremely talented and overqualified in their fields and have genuinely been incredible teachers, its just that 7/10 of them arent so great, whereas with my male teachers 10/10 are all just as good as the best of the best minority 3/10 female teachers.For these reasons I find it hard to respect their intelligence. I obviously know that there are women smarter than me, there are definitely some that may outperform me in some academic subjects, but a general trend i feel is that they can sometimes be... argumentative, illogical, or just downright problematic. Ive had people on their period tell me to ""just go away your face is making me angry right now."" I find it extremely obvious when women are on their period and find it much easier to live my life just avoiding them during it. I mean i understand you're in pain but its no reason to be a dickhead, especially when half the time im trying to help you with something. I sometimes get sick, and when i do, i get terribly sick, borderline bedridden every single rare occasion, but i know i have a day to get through with people in it, i know that people around me don't want to deal with a dickhead, i understand that i am not the only person that matters in the entire world, so i charge that shit and get on with my fuckin day. I do not become a problem for others like many women do. Maybe i underestimate the pain of a period, but just personally i feel like no matter how much pain I'm in id always stay compassionate to those around me. A large majority of the antivaxx community, flat earth community, and other stupid communities seem to be women. don't get me started with the ""would you still love me if i was a worm"" bullshit. Most the time its satire, but I've genuinely seen girls get mad at similar types of questions/answers. I could just never expect that from any type of guy, women just feel so emotional and annoying, if you can understand.I feel like another big reason I've lost a lot of respect for girls is after seeing how they'll sometimes throw themselves at guys. Seeing how they get ran through with no self respect. I have friends who can just scroll through loads of girls on their snap that all think they're in exclusive relationships. It just feels so stupid, do you not see or feel that you're getting played when he hasn't messaged you in hours? do you really think you're the only person he's named his kids with? Grow up man, get a grip, you're getting played and it makes me think you're just stupid.For these reasons i feel like i will probably never love a girl. At one point because i was mature i understood that i was most probably eventually going to get married. I even at points had girlfriends (one at a time guys calm down), and did kinda like them, but after growing up the feeling of love just doesn't feel worth much. when i was young, because i was mature i knew i would get married, now because i am mature, i understand that i most probably will never love somebody. Why would i allow myself to get vulnerable? whats the point? I genuinely don't need somebody. talking about my feelings? venting? having reassurance? been there, done that. If i really need anything my boys can help me truly. with them i don't need to talk about my feelings, i just spend time with them and forget about it. no healing a wound and embracing the scar, just erasing it altogether. Isnt that so much better than having a bitch?I want to clarify that I do still have some female friends, but honestly they act so masculine I 'd just call them my guys. and not all girls match the description I wrote, some are genuinely sweethearts, but they're just so extremely rare it's saddening.A separate issue is that I feel like everybody worries too much. This was slightly highlighted when I was talking about how I don't feel stressed for my gcses, but I want to cover it in more detail now. People worry about so much, one example is how they look. Keep in mind this is coming from an extremely unattractive person. People around me rate me a 6 - 8. I personally rate myself a solid 2 out of ten, And its not just because I hate myself, I've actually tested it many many times. When walking on the street ill take note of the first ten guys to walk past me, on average id rate myself more attractive than just one out of ten, placing me as being more attractive than 10%, therefore, a 2. I have done this many times and always gotten the same results.  It's not that I have terrible hygiene, a bad physique, or some deformity, I keep myself clean, feel nicely toned, and have nice fluffy hair, but I just find myself generally less attractive in aspects I can't really control in comparison to people around me, for example the shape of my eyes or the strength of my jaw. There are some people who worry way too much about the way their hair sits, how tall they are (again coming from somebody below 5'6), or the depth of their voice when they talk to women, I just don't get it. like just relax, you are what you are, at the end of the day not much can change that. I feel like that wasn't the best example. Some people worry so much about getting warnings from teachers, or somebody not liking them. These things feel like nothing to me. They hold no value. A warning from a teacher means nothing, it doesn't require me to stay an hour after school, it doesn't require me to do extra homework, it just means she's a bit pissed, and for that, I don't really care. Some people will cry or get stressed over a teacher verbally warning them in class. The same thing with somebody disrespecting them or not liking them. Some people will genuinely take arguments forward over a simple insult. Others like to act tough and impenetrable, threatening to get physical if you disrespect them. I constantly get praise from guys around me for just being ""such a calm guy"" when all I do is respect people around me and smile. Its not that difficult to just like people, so that they like you back.A bit of what I wrote in the paragraph above might feel a bit irrelevant or vague but it was fun writing and expressing, sorry for wasting your time.Something that's concerned me recently is how detached I feel from reality. Sometimes I'll be talking to somebody and just start seeing the conversation from different angles, outside of my body, in my head; Sometimes like a videogame third person view, sometimes from the side like streetfighter. Sometimes things just don't feel real, people don't make sense with the things they say, words feel like they arent english and time feels like its moving backwards. I still write 2019 in my books for the date and constantly get corrected by people. For some reason I always think its November (don't ask). I can never remember what day of the week it is or how long I've been somewhere, I don't think I could live without my watch lmao. I fall asleep constantly all over the place even when I get good sleep at night, on the dinner table, at school, sometimes just standing up talking to people. At times the world looks/feels through my eyes like I'm wearing sunglasses. there's an indescribable black tint on everything that I'm looking at, but when I really get back into my head it kinda goes away. Sometimes the world goes blurry and I just cant be asked to zone back into my vision, ill just lazily stay in this blurred unconscious conscious state.Well then, those were just a few of the things that go through my head on a daily basis or that I experience day to day. I'm willing to respond to/expand on any points or questions people might have or want to ask. I think all I needed was a bit of a vent, it was my first time typing anything out like that, I may post more later so stay tuned ig. Please do let me know if anything I said is out of the ordinary, and maybe how I could fix it, thanks!";Notice: I am not actively trying to violate rule 3, I just thought that there might be normal people;Venting;0;1;2024-04-19 21:29:54;2024-04-19;Friday;21:29:54;18922;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:14.565305

Maybe back in October when I first spoke up online about being pro-Palestine, lost so many ""friends"" acquaintances right away. At the time it didn't bother me, but 7 months in and I have lost my two best friends, literally my ride or die friends. I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling anymore, I have no one. I have tried to join community events, even community healing sessions with other proPali humans in my riding, but even there I feel out of place. Like I'm not enough for them.I have been out of work since January and struggling to make rent/bills/food for myself and dogs. My mom was helping a little here and there until my Uncle had a heart attack, so her focus is somewhere else. Her and I haven't been close for some years now, so it didn't bother me at first. Now she barely checks in, even though she still texts to tell me she loves me. I'm currently on welfare, which doesn't cover even half my rent and I'm terrified of being kicked out. My landlord has been kind in the past when I was a few months late, but had paid everything and things were good for awhile, until I left my job. Tbf, I thought I had another job lined up but it fell through, and it took me months to go and ask for my previous job. With no luck there, but did get a great recommendation from the manager, I did get temp work over Christmas. I'm just a server, went to cosmology school but I lost the passion throughout the years, so went back to serving. I do really love it, I want to go back to it, but I'm having no luck online.I have also been gaining weight, it's been up and down my whole life and I know when I'm a smaller size/number I just feel better about myself, the clothes I want to wear, the way my body physically feels when I get up or move feels different, obviously. I get more attention and respect from people when I'm smaller as well.I am so down about myself, I feel showering and cleaning daily is impossible, let alone doing my makeup or hair. I want to be able to get dressed up nice and walk around handing out resumes, because I know I could get a job no problem if people met me in person. But I haven't been able to, I have ZERO drive.I've also had health problems after problem. I had some crazy long weird flu, then I sprained my ankle, then DAILY chronic idiopathic hives, and now depression?I used to have people who could help pick me up when I was down, now I have no one. The funny thing is, for the first time in my life (that I could remember) I haven't felt suicidal. I say I don't want to ""be here"" but that's the state of the entire world and human race that I don't want to be with. I do want to be with my dogs and be happy and financially free to just be with them. I do want to work too. I just need a break. I go for long walks, go to group therapy once a month as it's free, so it's what I can afford. But every day keeps shuffling by and I keep falling deeper into feeling worthless.I don't know what to do anymore.

I was finally officially diagnosed with ADHD and MDD. Since then I've been trying a new medication, with the dosage being upped every twoish weeks. As far as I know, I'm finally on the actual dosage that the psychiatrist wants me to be on.If I am remembering correctly I should be at the end of the second week of being on this dosage. Last week I was feeling great, ready to get things done and actually doing things. I made plans to spend time with people, I cleaned, I did some studying. This week has been complete different. Every time I get ready to do anything, work, plans, cleaning, studying, etc. I have been getting heart palpitations. I try to push through as I was told by my therapist that it may be the best course of action. Saying something along the lines of ""If you convince yourself to get started by doing something small, you'll be able to continue on just fine.""

1c88223;I have a problem at school;ExpertInevitable8026;The thing is, I am a high schooler, and I have some problems with my classmates. First of all, I am in a friend group of 4 girls. One girl in the group is very problematic, she is straight up malicious. She hates everyone, she says very mean and hurtful things every day, she acts like an 8 year old with very serious mental problems. I know that she has a lot on her plate with her family and everything, but I can’t bear it anymore. The disgusting things she says to me every single day. “She is joking” the other 2 says. Meanwhile her jokes are mostly racist, and very mean. Its probably her projecting her inner problems to the outside world, but I cant/dont want to  tolerate this behaviour any longer. She is slowly but surely pulls the other two with her, but I would rather leave town than let the same thing happen with me. I turned 18 a couple of weeks ago, and let me tell you, I was in a really bad place these last couple years. I had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and bulimia, then I started taking meds, which helped me for a time. I’ve been managing since then, but I am starting to feel like “that” again. I have physical problems too, like diarrhea, nausea and I also had a panic attack. I dont want to be an outcast in my class, so Ive been keeping up with my “friends’”. But today, I left school, because I couldn’t stay there any longer. Also, this week, I noticed that they have been kinda avoiding me. What should I do? Should I stay like this? Or have a talk with them?  Should I just leave the friend group and get ready to be bullied?

1c87y6l;Running Circles in my Mind;jimmy-osborn;We all have that first true love. And this girl was all the way mine. I shared my first kiss with her, first everything really. Everything started out really great at first, but slowly things started to change. My sister, who I hadn’t seen or heard from in years had contacted me on Facebook, and with that and having this girl in my life I was the happiest I’ve ever been, the only downside was my home life which I’ve recently moved away from. But around the time that my sister contacted me, this girl said she began noticing a change in me, one that I, nor anybody else in my life could notice. Now she herself has been through very shitty relationships, so I understand she worries about a lot of things, but so have I, and because of this, I started trying to “fix” myself, this caused me to feel like I was running circles in my mind trying to find this problem, this change, but in reality I feel as if at that point I was the happiest I’ve ever been in a long time, and I was told that she was trying to make it a problem but I just don’t know. Then things started spiraling a couple months later, she canceled getting graduation photos taken with me, which obviously upset me as graduation is a once in a lifetime thing and wanting to spend my life with her I felt as though we should get a few pictures taken together. She didn’t like the idea of it because she felt as if she would look like shit and didn’t want me to have to look at it for the rest of my life. I have self esteem issues myself, so I completely understand, but it did upset me. Then about a week before my prom, she cancelled that too, which again I was very upset about. But instead we had decided we would go to Funopolis because that’s what she wanted to do, and I agreed. But a few days before prom, she asked me if I could take her, I said no because I felt like it would make prom feel less special if we just kept going, which we had already been once a few days before this argument happened, but this upset her as she didn’t understand how it would make it less special, and she said she felt as if I was controlling her by not taking her. She said we needed to talk in person, so I went over to her house and that’s when she broke up with me. Her first reason being that because she felt like I was controlling her and then because she said she needed to work on herself. She never understood why I feel the way I do about things, she always said communicate is important and that I needed to get better at it, but when I would try and communicate she would get angry, or upset. But we’ve been broken up since and I don’t know what to do, I feel lost without her, I truly did believe I would be spending the rest of my life with her. I tell myself that if it was meant to be then it would work out in due time but I’m running out of hope.

1c86yzs;What distinguishes a phobia from ocd?;Crematedheaux;I know for certain i have a phobia of passing out, it controls my life and what I do. This phobia also caused me to develop a blood phobia as the last time I passed as was due to imagining an image of blood and it making me Squeamish and then faint. I am constantly worrying if I’m going to pass out it’s always in public unless I cut myself bad at home. But, what made me wonder if it may be OCD is I get really bad intrusive thoughts, I get flashes of gore I really do not want I would say around 5 times an hour and this convinces my brain I’m going to pass out because I’ve “seen blood” and it’s happened before. It causes me to be panicky I’d say like at least 7 times an hour and it’s genuinely exhausting. When I feel like this I then drink water because I’m convinced it’ll make me less likely to pass out or I’ll eat sugar. I also had a dream I passed out at a time ending in :49 which means whenever I see that time on a clock I have to stare at it until it goes away or I will 100% pass out. But I don’t know I do get intrusive thoughts on other things but i don’t wanna say cause they’re quite embarrassing but I don’t know if it’s OCD since I’m mainly worried about one thing which is passing out.;I know for certain i have a phobia of passing out, it controls my life and what I do.

I've been on Adderall since then and back in 2021 I was put on Venlafaxine to help focus more in my depression as well. I graduated in 2022 and I feel like things have only gotten worse. I feel so alone all the time and like nobody ever cares about me, nothing I do matters at all. I'm so lonely and all my ""friends"" from school never talk to me anymore, some didn't even talk to me during school. I'm just so tired of everything and I'm tired all the time, there are days I don't want to get out of bed at all because there's no real point and life sucks. I keep trying to make new friends but they all push me away too and I don't know what else to do. There have been times I think about how if I just vanished one day not a single person would care and some people might actually enjoy me being gone. I've never been great at talking to people or opening up about my true feelings, I've worn a mask for so long and now I don't feel anything but lonely and shut out even though when I'm around others I can smile and pretend I'm alright but I'm not. I've had times where I think about how easy it would be to just end it all but I know that's not good, I really just wish anyone would care for me. Everytime I've tried opening up to my mom she instantly flips it against me and calls me ungrateful and that I owe her and then she cries and makes comments about how she's sorry I didn't get the mom I wanted and she just tunes me out. I know that I don't matter to anyone and that nobody cares about me at all. I've been single my whole life and it's really impacted me hard, I've asked girls out and all except one said no. The one girl who said yes then proceeded to stick me up and then want nothing to do with me without any reason, I thought she was my friend for a while and she was super excited I asked her out and then she never showed up and didn't tell me why. I don't know why I ever bother trying to go outside to be in public. Why should I care for people when nobody cares for me? I'm just so freaking tired of everything and want it all to end. I'm far from being who people see when they look at me, truthfully inside I'm as far from happy as can be, I can't remember when I was last actually happy. I am out of shape due to a hip surgery I had in 2022 and I haven't had any motivation to try and get back into shape like I was before I hurt my hip back in 2019. I don't know why people don't seem to care about me, why do I still try to be there for others when nobody is every here for me? I just wish for once I could finally actually feel loved and cared for by someone. I constantly think about how alone I am, even when family is around I'm still lonely. I know that I'm not special and that nobody cares about me at all. I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all, life sucks and every single day I never want to get out of bed.

1c85i2n;I'm afraid I might have an eating disorder.;Maybe_later727;I (17 f) am afraid I might be showing some tendencies to an eating disorder. I'll start by saying that I have always hated my body. But I think everyone has been a little insecure in their lives no? For my height I'm considered to have a pretty normal weight. But despite this, since I was 13 I have been looking in the mirror, grabbing at the fat on my waist, legs, and belly and have the urgency to just grab a pair of scissors and cut it all off. I have noticed that in the last 3 years I have been weighting myself everyday, to decide if it is worth to eat dinner or have some snacks during the day, in order to not gain weight the next day. One time I went to Brazil to stay with my mom's side of the family after not seeing them for many years. We didn't have a scale, and I remember just being so frustrated and anxious everytime I woke up because I couldn't weight myself, so I had to stand in front of the mirror and guess if I had gained weight or not during my stay.Despite skipping many meals or eating less I have never fainted nor looked tired, so there really isn't any exterior health issue that I should worry about. However I only recently have realized that I have had binge eating tendencies since I was 10. Everytime I'm left alone in the kitchen and I know no one can see me, I go through every cabinet, any kind of place that might store food, to just eat. And I can't seem to stop until I just feel nauseous or when I feel my mom coming down the stairs. Everytime I hear her I just rush to hide every plastic wrap or hint that might indicate I have been eating. I don't know why, but I just feel so ashamed being caught eating outside of meals. The food I eat during these periods can go from cookies, chocolate, bread to canned tuna, and any leftovers I can find.Despite everything I have never tried to throw up, because I knew it was wrong, or at least until today. Last week I had to get a breast surgery for some fibroadenoma they had found some months ago. Apparently it did something to my body because in just a week I have gained 2 kg. Today I have decided to only eat a salad for lunch, and I planned to also skip dinner in order to lose a few grams. When my mom went out to take the dog for a walk however I got up and instinctively went to the kitchen. I was planning to only get a glass of water, however when I saw some leftover rice from the lunch my mum made I just couldn't help myself and grabbed a spoon to eat it with. It was only at the 5th spoonful that I stopped myself and decided to make some tea to stop my hunger. I made the tea and sat down. But my mistake was to grab two cookies to eat with the tea. I don't know how many I ate. But I know I only stopped when I felt like I couldn't eat anymore. I grabbed the leftover tea and threw it in the sink, not being able to drink anymore. I sat down on the couch, and only then the reality of what happened hit me. I have never felt so fucking disgusted in my life, and when I went to the bathroom I just couldn't help but grab my toothbrush and shove it down my throat, hoping to puke. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I didn't. I couldn't manage to. And after a few tries I just began crying, understanding that what I was doing was absolutely destroying me. I know that there are people that are dying for this kind of things, I know a girl in my class that almost died at the hospital because of Anorexia. And it's for this exact reason that I feel like I am not allowed to ask for help, because my life is not at risk as many other who have REAL eating disorders. I hate people who consider themselves to have eating disorders just because they sometimes don't like themselves in a dress or because they haven't eaten lunch that day. And I don't want to be that kind of person. But it has been going on for so long that I can't even recognize if what I'm experiencing is a real issue or if I'm being dramatic.

Now to my question, I find it very difficult to understand how it could have gotten so bad because I used to feel normal and ""happy"" and never thought about mental problems but only about what I wanted to achieve and do. Trying therapy didn't really work. Now I would like to try to understand my problems myself and know how it could come to this and how I can please feel good and normal again. Because of these mental problems, I don't know if my problems are ""big enough"" to trigger my situation. I have been lying to everyone around me for 5 years without exception that I am successfully self-employed and also have a company that shows people how to teach what I am supposedly so good at (so I lie to them too) I don't actively think about how this is stressing me or anything else, but only about how I feel and how much better everything used to be. Is this a problem that can lead to mental problems? Apart from that, I can't think of anything else, my life is monotonous and is only about this ""independence fake job“ I don’t feel remorse or anything no joy nothing and I know that Iam not a bad person I always try the best for people never ever in the past I felt suicidal just the past 3,5 years Iam so done I don’t know what is going on and what mode my brain has switched on. It feels like brain damage and that this switch will never be the same so suicide feels like the only logical way out. Every fucking day has been this bad I can’t believe it.

1c857el;I hear voices, but they arent bad. Can someone tell me what this is?;Somethingwithtoast;Alright so I’ve talked to two people about this, one of which deals either the exact same thing, the other has no clue what it is. I’m probably gonna sound insane talking about this, but I do wanna know what it is. Okay, so since I was relatively young, I’ve heard voices in my head. There words are clear, they sound different, and they all have different personalities, opinions, and preferences. They do not tell me to do anything bad, but when I’m panicking, upset, angry, nervous, anything along those lines, they will speak to me and help me and try to help me calm down, they literally talk to me as if they are real people. And I’m able to tell the difference between them and my subconscious. Like what is this? I have a problem with dealing with derealization, dissociation, maladaptive daydreaming, and other mental disorders though none of them fall under the psychosis umbrella as far as I know.

1c854o9;Please help me with advice or opinion ;noali99;I don't know if this Is the right reddit, but please just give my your oppinion :)HiI'm letting my negative voice get the better of me and now I don't know what is really just the negative voice or real. I need advice So I started a new job a month ago. I'm really enthusiastic about it because my first job was not it, my colleagues weren't really nice, didn't do anything to get to know me ect.... ( and I know they didn't need to but I just like that) And in my new job people are happy about me,  they do want to get to know who I am, not just if I can do the job. And I have one colleague who is just really happy and enthusiastic that i'm working there, she gave mr compliments about my work energy and being happy ect....In my enthusiasm I told my parents about her and that she gave me compliments.They immediately reacted like she did something wrong, they asked if she was losing her job or scared to lose her job or just insecure.  I got really defensive ( I get that alot when my family has an opinion like this about someone they don't know) But now my grandparents had the same reaction when I told them my colleague liked me and my work energy ect... Am I wrong for thinking she gave me an sincere compliment ?  Are they reacting in a weird way. I don't know anymore, this makes me doubt my work again and the realness from my colleagues.Maybe she is insecure, but does that mean the compliments are fake? Am I not nice to work with. Is my enthusiasm wrong?  Should I not be enthusiastic about a compliment??? Update: The compliment was : My colleague said to me  she was happy that I started the job and chose the job. And  she said she liked my energy and that i'm always happy and she likes to work together with me.;I don't know if this Is the right reddit, but please just give my your oppinion :)HiI'm letting my n;Opinion / Thoughts;1;1;2024-04-19 19:09:23;2024-04-19;Friday;19:09:23;1734;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:15.844831

1c84xuu;Every time I think I meet someone normal, they end up being weird around/to me.;Hardgore-529;"I (20F) am severely depressed (have been for years) and I’ve turned to Reddit to try find people who are similar to me, to see how they manage and just feel less alone. I peruse r/selfharm mostly, since my major concern is my own self harm. I met a few guys around my age there; they seemed nice at first. But after a few hours of talking it became obvious they only cared about trying to get pictures of my cuts and my body. I was stupid and sent some SFW and mild pictures at first to introduce myself, but I grew uncomfortable and deleted them once they started to seemingly come onto me even when I told them repeatedly I had a partner. Many of them told me several times I was hot, even going as far as saying they were getting turned on by me. One guy even “joked” about posting my pictures if I didn’t send more. Even though the pictures are innocent, some have my face and everything and I didn’t want them to be public for my own safety as a woman. This isn’t the first time I’ve had people behave this way around me; I’ve had both online and in person friends/people act like this with me, which is why I’m just SO tired of it.I just want normal friends. I know I was kind of dumb to expect that from Reddit but still.

1c84x50;Am I really in love or is it my mental health issues?;Inside-Stress7517;I KNOW THIS IS ALOT BUT PLEASE READ I NEED HELP! Making a second post because I am desperate to feel better. I’m 25F and my bf is 24M. April 15th was our 9 months. This is both of our first actually good/healthy relationships. tl:dr amazing relationship but I get anxious and question my feelings We both have our share of mental health issues but my anxiety only got bad once I met him. I have depression and random mood swings for no reason but once those are prolonged or there is some life event that brings me down it makes my anxiety RAGE and when this happens I question my feelings for him, which makes it 100x worse. When my problems are bad, my feelings are questioned in my head, when his are bad his feelings aren’t questioned by him. We matched on hinge late June 2023. Things were just amazing from the start, until my first bit of anxiety after a random down swing in my mood when we were hanging out at the end of our 3rd week of talking. My mind couldn’t handle being with him but I literally wanted to die at the thought of losing him. We started dating after 5 days of a grippy sock vacay (GSV) for me. Things were perfection until beginning of November when my anxiety came back. I went on a 2 day GSV then and eventually with therapy and better meds felt consistently better by late December. Things have again been pretty damn good until 2 days ago. We have had a few fights, one weeklong spree of fighting over the same things, but always come out of it better. If I were to make a list of everything I wanted in a partner, he has it. We moved in together after a week of dating because my first GSV made me lose my job and all my utilities got shut off in the middle of Ohio summer. We got our own apartment with both of our names on the lease in October. I currently don’t have a job after my last job closing its location and have been stuck at home for 2 weeks bored out of my mind with nothing I normally enjoyed being fun anymore. I can’t go do anything either because I have no savings and $5 in my bank account. My bf is VERY supportive of the fact that I’m trying to find a job I won’t be miserable in, and has promised me multiple times he doesn’t mind covering expenses until I find a job. (I have an interview FINALLY on Wednesday of next week.) The prolonged boredom and joblessness/lack of money has made me very depressed, which has in turn brought my anxiety back because when I’m depressed I don’t enjoy anything and therefore when me and my bf do something together I’m not enjoying it, and I of course haven’t been in the mood for sex recently either. That makes my mind start questioning everything like if I am just bored and depressed or don’t want to do things with him, yet I know I don’t even want to do anything when I am alone. It also makes me question my attraction to him, despite knowing I’m just not in the mood when I’m depressed. When I am feeling good mentally I don’t doubt my feelings for him at all, even when we’re bored together. When I’m feeling bad he makes me feel better and cuddling with him makes me feel better. We want all the same things in life and are very similar. We’ve looked at rings and started trying to have a baby already. Even when I’m down I can have bits here and there where my love for him resurfaces and I feel happy and better but it just goes away very soon after, I can’t get it to stick. There is a lot about this relationship I’m not used to like genuine trust, an actual good guy, the actual potential for a life of happiness, and next level support and caring and loving me for exactly who I am. I think part of me is still super scared it’s not real bc it seems too good to be true after all the horrible men I’ve dealt with in the past. He helped me feel a lot better yesterday after a 30 minute phone call. Im reading this book recently that says thoughts are just there, but thinking is the cause of suffering, but I cannot stop thinking about the thoughts that pop up in my head making me question my feelings for him. UGHHH I’ve gotten better twice before with weekly therapy and medicine. Just 3 weeks ago I felt so good I even told my therapist we can meet less often, I finally have an apt next week to talk to her. I’m used to dealing with my problems alone and being okay with letting “the bad side” win because that’s easier. I think that now that I have something truly good my mind works overtime to try and take it away from me. When I get anxiety I get physically sick which only gives me more anxiety so it’s really hard to break the loop. I do sometimes wish I could just be dead so I wouldn’t have to deal with these problems anymore. I’m pretty sure my feelings have always been real and strong but why are they what my mind questions when I feel bad? How do I stop this? I was reading some forum yesterday about people who’ve all had similar concerns but it didn’t really help me. If you were to ask me how I would feel if we broke up, right now since I am depressed all I could say was nothing. The act of breaking up makes me an ungodly amount of anxious but what happens after that I can’t seem to figure out how it makes me feel. We hadn’t had sex in a week, which is uncommon for us, so last night I made myself so with him to try and feel a better connection to him but I was thinking the whole time about if that would make me feel better so I didn’t particularly enjoy it that much, which I like to think is because I’m still depressed and a bit anxious, but my mind tries to tell me it’s because I’m not attracted to him. I do think he is attractive, but he is tall and skinny (but muscular) and I am tall and pretty chunky. Is my attraction just doubted because I hate my own body so much? I’m trying to feel better but every time I do the thoughts come back and push down the good feelings I have. I also did read that in a healthy long term relationship feelings are going to go in and out here and there which may just be actually normal but hard for me to grasp but I can’t tell. I’m trying to just enjoy little good moments to build the love back up in my mind but I can’t seem to feel anything strong towards him right now. So my question is, do I love him and just have strong mental issues filled with self destruction or do I just for some reason not love him? Am I trying to convince myself it’s real because he’s so good or is my mind trying to do the opposite? How do I tell which thoughts and feelings are real and which ones are made up by my mind to hurt me?;I KNOW THIS IS ALOT BUT PLEASE READ I NEED HELP!

1c84w7b;Working in child care;Justice_Fllash;So without going into much detail about what happened I'm just in need of advice. I(21M) work in childcare, some after school daycare thing in a smaller school district I've been at for 5 years now. So I've been working with, for the most part, the same kids for up to five years. This job is mostly just playing with kids in the gym or leading different programs for any student K-12 that just needs a place after school for some reason.     My job really hasn't been too serious. I just deal with problems as they come. Kids fight, parents get mad, so on and so forth. But recently one of the kids that I've been working with for the entire time I've been working at this place came to me about something serious. I won't go into details, but they basically told me that I was really one of the only people in the school that they trusted to tell what happened to them.       I did all the right things, told my boss and informed the proper people. But like, what do I do now? I never really thought that I would need to do something like that, or like be someone a child could come to about things like that.      I guess that's where I need advice. I don't know what I'm supposed to do next. Like, I want to be able to at least try and help them. They're a depressed teen going though hell.

1c84vk4;I did something unforgivable ;SkyConscious6961;"I was talking to this guy online and we were sharing our fantasies. I admitted that I feel guilt over my sexual fantasies and he admitted to having sexual thoughts about his brothers kids. he also admitted to being raped when he was younger so I sympathized with him a little but i was mostly weirded out and suspicious but he said he wouldn't act on them and advised me not to act on mine as well. We kept talking for a bit and I don't even remember what it was about. for a moment I thought ""am I any better then him?"" because I had bad fantasies about being a kid and bad stuff happening to me so I did sympathize with him only because of what he went through. but the fact it was specific people he could be close to threw me off but we kept talking and I figured if he doesn't admit to anything I can't report him. I think we had a sexuak convo after but I can't remember.now I've realized, I've basically condoned and was complicit with pedophilia and a person who may have done things to kids because I wanted attention. This is the worst thing anyone can do and I need to kill myself. I'm going to find a gun and shoot myself in the head. the guilt is unbearableI would 100 percent stop talking to him if he admitted to anything and I even considered asking him if he did so i could try and report anything he says. but i was conflicted and in a way felt I was no better then him. I know he could easily be lying but I didn't think much about it then.then i remember those stories about parents knowing sexual abuse is happening but don't do anything. I basically did that in a way, because he could have easily lied to me by saying he didn't act on it. I knew that too but didn't immediately stop talking. I genuinely can't remember what I said, I didn't send nudes or say anything overly sexual we just talked about some stuff before he blocked me after I refused him nudesI literally was complicit with possible abuse and I can't take it anymore I didn't encourage any of the fantasies of what he went through and I even considered reporting him but he didn't admit to a crime. I told myself I'm not any better because of my rape and stuff fantasies and I only kept talking to him cuz he opened up about his sexual abusebut I am basically condoning possible sexual abuse and pedophilia by doing that.. no he didn't admit to anything but why the fuck did I keep talking to him? I guess I felt like I had no one else or wasn't any better then himI want to say I've talked to a LOT of creeps online.. I've explicitly asked multiple of them if they harm children due to their kinks (which mine are similar) and they say no but still sometimes i blocked them. I was very hyper aware of doing the wrong thing and constantly scared someone was abusing kids. I would even ask innocent people if they harm kids because I was so obsessed with the idea of it and scared of children being harmed. I didn't know how to bring it up in this situation I need to kill myself, what I've done is too unforgivableI have blocked people online after they've said weird things like that and I've blocked a guy after he said he would do stuff with teenagers. I don't know why I didn't immediately end the conversation, I don't know what I said after. I don't think I felt comfortable saying anything sexual after but I don't remember. I don't remember anything I said after except that I declined nudes.I felt just as bad as him or worse because of my fantasies and I tried not to say anything judging , we just talked about childhood trauma and I talked to him about what happened to me as a kid, I think it stopped being sexual after he revealed that fantasy but I genuinely don't remember. I Did NOT encourage his fantasy or anything he said about kids, we had a discussion about childhood trauma and what happened to him and what he thinks happened to me I don't remember if it turned sexual afterHe claims to not have acted on anything and I didn't feel as comfortable having sexual conversations after he said that, I just wanted someone to talk to who has been through similar things, I've been told I condoned pedophilia by doing this and did things with a possible abuserAll I remember is talking about childhood trauma to him and him helping me through it and talking about his after, I even considered asking him if he ever abused anyone and trying to get more info out of him.

1c84pm4;Depressed, traumatized and with serious problems in marriage. I can't see a way out;Haunting_Cheetah_381;I've had depression since I was 8 years old. I was sexually abused over several years and by several different men. My parents separated at that time and with that I lost contact with all the friends I had, including my father. I've been bullied because of my skin color, my curly hair, my old pimples on my face, my overweight and my slowness in understanding what others are talking about. I've been beaten to the point where I've come home limping and spitting blood. I've had my pants pulled down in front of my whole class and no one, absolutely no one, thought it was bizarre. They were laughing at me for months, always joking about the size of my penis (it's not micro, thankfully, but it's reason for jokes). I had several suicide attempts and in the most serious of all I had to be bedridden in a coma for two weeks, but I had no visit from anyone other than my father. I was abandoned several times by people who claimed to be my friends and humiliated by several girls I tried to meet. I have always been a freak in the eyes of others, that is, until the beginning of my adult life.I had a lot of problems in my childhood, very serious things that never went away from me. I don't intend to comment on everything that happened to me, but I ask you to understand that I have never met another person who has gone through everything I went through. As a consequence, I developed some disorders, including depression and what other people call borderline personality disorder. I don't believe in the existence of this disorder, I believe that what happens to me is a combination of several other disorders. Borderline seems to be an excuse to encompass everything that other disorders cause in terms of harm. The point is that I had several suicide attempts and still didn't feel the urgency to live.I recently had the diagnosis of adhd and everything started to make a lot more sense to me. My poor grades for most of my life, my difficulty maintaining friendships, my hyperactivity, my hypersensitivities, my emotional dysregulation, my difficulty staying focused, my poor memory (I wrote this twice and just checking the text again I noticed), my difficulty talking and maintaining conversations with other people, my impulsivities, etc. But making sense doesn't make me forgive myself or other people. In the end, I can only see myself as a victim that, frankly, didn't deserve so much stress.I've taken every kind of antidepressant you want to name. I used several illicit drugs and psychedelics which are known to improve mental health. I have been through several treatment sessions with ketamine and medical follow-up to treat depression. Nothing has improved. But, as the years passed, things began to improve externally. I've had several achievements that I never imagined I would be able to achieve: I wrote a math book that sold very well (during elementary and high school I had so much difficulty in math that I almost failed every year), I made amazing friendships with amazing people, my relationship with my father came back and now we are good friends, I found an amazing spouse who was always willing to do everything for us (at least in the past), I got in the hardest course at the hardest university in my country, I finally had a diagnosis that made sense and started taking the correct medication that helped me a lot with emotional dysregulation, I had help from all the people when I asked for it. Anyway, I had a lot of good things, things that a lot of people never had or will never have in life.Still, why am I here looking again about how to make cyanide and what dosage is enough to end my life? Why do I defend myself so much from everything anyone say to me, even if it's a joke? Why do I despair so much over any fight I have with someone I love, so that I begin to wish for suicide? Why did I have to put my college semester on hold to rest my mind and not freak out? Why can't I live like a normal human being?I'm reading the most recommended and scientific books about self-esteem, doing the tasks of the workbooks, going to therapy, losing weight and trying to feel better, learning methods to improve my marriage, taking the right meds, trying to sleep on time, trying to do more things that I enjoy, trying to reconnect with my family and old friends, trying to understand more about the people that surround me, avoiding bad things that make me get worse (except music) etc. Even so, my depression and my desire for eternal rest won't go away. I love to sleep and forget that I exist, I love not to exist and let everything occur without me knowing.In the last few months I'm having very serious fights with my wife and I don't deny that this has been the biggest motivation for my desire of death. But how can I have a healthy marriage when I have so many knee-jerk reactions that I can't change and so much trauma from my past? Are there any irreparable cases? Is my case irreparable?My two paternal great-grandfathers committed suicide. My paternal grandfather committed suicide. My father, although he also suffers a lot, is a very strong man and I don't believe he is capable of giving up on his own life. But I may give up, soon.So what do I have left? The certainty I have is that I can't live without my wife. I know many will say it's just a matter of time, in which case I ask for empathy. I hope you understand that some things are more difficult for some people. I could never forget her, I would never be able to get over or forgive myself for the mistakes I made (which were really very serious, abusive mistakes).The problem is that I can't forgive myself and I can't blame myself for everything either. My hyperactivity due to adhd made me always want to do something with her and with that I suffocated her a lot with my desires. This suffocation was even more damaging to her because she is autistic (we also found out recently). There was never a notion in me that what I was doing was suffocating, it just didn't make sense to me that she wouldn't want to play something with me until 6 in the morning. Or that she didn't want to leave the house to do something and have fun after 15 minutes we got home. Or that I was cutting off her lines constantly trying to participate in communication and show interest, while I was actually giving her the intention to not care about what she says. Things like that were distancing her from me more and more and our actual fights are always about that distancing.This distancing brought me despair and with it other very serious problems. For example, five months ago I wanted to kill myself because of the constants fights with my wife, so I took all the medication that I had and started taking it. She tried to stop me and it escalated into a fight with physical abuse. I feel extremely embarrassed and depressed to talk about it, but it has to be talked about.I understand very well how that alone should be reason enough for her to leave me. But, when I think back to it, I can't see in me the desire to have hurted her. I just did it, in impulsiveness (I was not taking any medication for the adhd or for the depression), and then I freaked out about myself minutes later. She also assaulted me a few times, even before I assaulted her,  but I can't get upset about it because I'm so much bigger than her, so I understand that the traumatic difference is huge.I never punched her, or slapped her in the face, nothing like that. What happened was I used force to take the medication back and with that I ended up squeezing her arms, hurting her. Or when trying to cover her mouth so she doesn't scream and the neighbors don't call the police (when she's stressed she starts screaming a lot, desperately, the yelling has nothing to do with being physically abused). Again, I don't defend my actions and I sincerely believe that they are reason enough for her to abandon me or even that I will never have a relationship again.However, as soon as I started taking my adhd medication (three months ago), all the anger changed in me. I don't feel stress all the time anymore, I don't get desperate and violent during a fight, I don't break things, I don't attempt suicide in a hasty way. If I had been medicated at the time, we would never have escalated the fights to this level. So, I need to anyway say that I also see myself as a victim (in the sense that anyone who has lived through what I have lived through would have had similar or worse reactions). Of course, not a victim of her, but of the other people who hurted me and of the horrible genetics in the men inside my family. My childhood had a lot of violence, every day I was beaten by someone and I learned to defend myself with violence as well.I never stopped her from leaving, I always made it clear to her that if she wanted to, she could leave and live a new life. I know that my actions may be unforgivable, and therefore she needs to think more about herself. But she never really wanted to leave, she ask me to treat the issues and then get back to a healthy marriage. The problem I see is that the past have become unforgivable, she will never forget everything that happened. All it takes is the slightest disagreement between us for her to start remembering everything and start criticizing me for the past (again and again: not her fault, but it keeps happening).So, I'm slowly stepping away in order to give her the courage to walk away and be happy. The problem is that I'm absolutely sure that it would cause my suicide, and she's sure of it too. So what can I do? How can I be forgiven for the mistakes I've made and get back to having a happy life with her? Is there any book, any course, anything that can help she sees everything that happened as a lack of help to me in first place?I understand that this text may give many here the feeling that I am manipulating her or that I am an abuser who threatens suicide if she leaves. Please don't take it that way. I haven't made these threats to her in many months, but we both know how fragile my mental health is. Don't feel angry with me, or pity me. I just ask you to understand that I have always tried to do the best I can with what was present in my life in every moment. I try to be a wonderful husband with her and 99% of the time I succeed, but when I don't I become a horrible person that no one deserves to be around. Although there is no more violence, I continue to get hurt very easily and this leads to fights between us. We've had such happy moments that the impression that remains is that those moments have kept us together until now, no matter what happened.Is there any chance my marriage will improve? Is there any chance she will forgive me for my mistakes and live well with me? Is there any chance I can enjoy my future with her? Is there a possibility that I will improve and never make the same mistakes again? I know I can't live without her, please take that as a fact.

1c84o7i;my intrusive thoughts last for hours and I am hoping to find other people who experience the same so I know I'm not alone;Sir-Anemone;"I'm hoping to find some people who experience something similar, because I never see people talking about it and I don't know how to even start googling for something like this. all I get is shitty articles about how to cope with your intrusive thoughts and nothing actually useful. I just want to know I'm not the only one suffering this, ya know?  small context: I have diagnosed autism, am 99% sure I also have adhd, idk about anything elseso. I get violent intrusive thoughts a lot, especially when I'm anxious or stressed, but also sometimes when I'm otherwise fine but my brain is bored. stuff like stabbing, getting into accidents on purpose, sometimes sexual but not in a way I want or like, etc etc  I also have a very powerful and active imagination and have a pretty good and realistic ""mind's eye"". I can sometimes spend hours daydreaming scenarios. often it's the same scenario in a loop but in a thousand little different ways as if I'm shooting a movie and they're retakes.sometimes, these intrusive thoughts turn into scenarios like that, and my brain will then spend hours making shit up that ranges from uncomfortable to incredibly distressing. sometimes it's very gore-y and violent or body horror. I get this a lot when I'm panicking or at risk of having a meltdown and it always makes things so much worse.  I cannot consciously stop it. trying to stop it makes it worse. I can only hope to find something that distracts my brain enough that it focuses on that instead.  this shit is why I can't engage with a lot of horror media because whatever gore-y or body horror things happen in there will then later show up in my thoughts to torture me. it's not even just horror things. one time several years ago I watched the garden hose blow up and explode and my brain made me imagine my own arteries blowing up like that for months. I still get it sometimes.when I told this to my old doctor he just told me to start doing ""mindfulness"" which.. wasn't helpful lol.

1c847vb;I love my dad but I think he's a narcissist.;ZookeepergameSome953;"My parents divorced last September (not on paper yet). I've only seen my dad once after that. Shortly after the divorce he got a new woman and in his words 'it was never gonna work out between us anyway"", which was really hard for my family. After all that he came to visit 'us' but the whole time it was just my parents threatening eachother and fighting. At that time I also got really sick and smashed my face against a hard hook. I haven't seen him since then but we call and message 3-4 times a week.He wants to visited again. My mom had made it clear to him and everyone that she doesn't want him in this house (it's in her name btw) but I still felt the need to call him and make sure he hears it directly from me, because I thought it'll feel less demanding if I said it. He didn't care.After every call I make sure he knows that I love him and no matter what he does I'll always love him and that we all forgave him, even though he never said sorry but I get his reasons. Eventually I came to the realisation that maybe it was good for both of them. A few days ago he said he wants to visit us again, but I'm sure he knows that nobody here wants him and my mother in the same house. It'll just be uncomfortable and we'll be in fear 24/7. So this time I told him that, and he just wasn't taking my seriously at all. It felt like he just didn't care. I told him that if he really wanted to see his children he wouldn't be coming to this house and since he lives in another country, he should take us there. I told him that if he still came here for that excuse then he's just feeding his ego. He said that my mom will leave the house for the time he's there but that's just pathetic... He kept asking stupid and angering questions like:Me: ""We don't want you to come here to visit us, we should come to you because it's better for all of us.""Him: ""Why is it better?""Me: ""Because being in the same space as both of you (my parents) is just uncomfortable and none of your children want it""Him: ""why?""Me: ""Because your our father and you should care about how we feel! If you visiting us is going to make us anxious and uncomfortable then that's not good right!? So we want to spend time with you alone without our mother""Him: ""She can leave the house, I don't have anything to do with her.""Me: ""But it's still her house, just ignore all the other stuff and do it for us (his children)""Him: ""No I won't be calling or messaging you okay""Me: ""I'm not saying I don't want to see you! I do! But not like this.""Him: ""It's my choice and I don't want to see yall now""I really do want to see him and spend time with him after so long because he never got to be with his children alone. So I legit think it'll be a good bonding time and to let everything go! But at this point it just feels like I'm babying my own father and now he's sulking. I got so frustrated I cried for a good 20 minutes. I still love him and want to see him ofcorse but i just wish he would give a shit one day and stop caring sm about his ego or something like that.";My parents divorced last September (not on paper yet).

I got the reel randomly on my explore page and thought it was pretty cool and interesting with what they were doing so I made this second account to promote their content on the appropriate subreddit. Out of curiosity I DMed them and told them how I found their reel very cool and unique. They were very grateful and thankful telling me how it's been so long since they've heard nice things and that my one simple compliment meant so much to them. I obviously felt very nice and told them to upload more and keep going but they told me how they may not considering their online presence was shattered by a group of friends they once had and they were trying something new here but it didn't pan out the way they expected. Idk why but I felt really bad for them after this and mind you this person wasn't self loathing or trying to indulge in pity.

Ever since I was 16 I just started to look at myself disappointed, mainly at who I am and my body especially. It was just body dysphoria at first... you know the ""normal"" teenage insecurities. But these slowly started to focus into my gender. I've never seen myself as masculine at all, and (besides when the gender dysphoria got to me) neither feminine really. But especially these past few months have been hard.I just feel empty, I look at others and am jealous of their happiness. When I see women and trans-women I feel even more jealousy towards them.All this is actually making my head hurt. I'm worried that If I am trans I will be shunned.

My psychiatrist has already increased the dosage of my medication.Since it's not working, I've created an action plan.When it comes to hearing voices, I can tell that they're just in my head when they seem to come from behind the wall or from the ceiling.When it comes to smell, I'm still having problems because it's hard to distinguish between reality and my episodes. I need to confirm this with a member of my family or with my friend. When I'm having an episode, I notice that the most common smell I experience is the smell of blood and rotten flesh.

1c80ye3;advice n support;1234xoxopp;I feel like I live in a present hell, where I want to connect, I want intimacy but fear/ anxiety stops me experiencing it or being open to connections. The only 2 people I connect with are my childhood friends who don't live in the county I'm currently in. Other than them I find it impossible to exist in the world in peace, connect with people without feeling so much fear. When my friend came to visit me here, she interacted with so many people / made connection easily / so I tried to copy her and I found it easier to interact and connect with people but now she's left I feel back to feeling really alone , feeling unable or not knowing how to connect with new people, interact with them from a place of ease and authenticity. I'm thirsty for human connection but I'm too scared of people. It's really depressing. Any advice ? I've felt like this for so long around people, I dont know what it is that's holding me back. It's a major block. There's solace in knowing there are 2/3 (all from childhood) people I connect with but other than that I find it impossible to connect with people. Also all of these friends I have really intense friendships with (more like non sexual romantic relationships). I have no idea what it's like to have a friendship that isn't the most intense thing. I will say my close friendships are extremely beautiful even though they're intense af. I feel like they allow me to channel my love inside my heart. Without them I feel like I have no vehicle to channel my love, so my love ends up being pain the lonelier I get. I've just had so many instances in my life where humans have scared me ad let me down and I feel like now I'm just scared of everyone and despite this knowledge I can't shake it. it's a physical feeling of fear / gaurd up. Plus I'm living with housemate in this new foreign country I live In who I have difficulties with which adds to my loneliness. No-one would ever expect someone like me to feel like this. I mask so well. I'm attractive and appear popular and charming but inside I feel so lonely. I dont know if maybe I've suffered from autism all these years. Both of those 2 closest friends think I have it and they know me really well. But they're also not doctors so I don't know how trustworthy their opinions are. And then sometimes I think my life Is going well but It's just my mask connecting with people. sometimes I get lost in my mask. Any advice or insights to what I'm going through / what I could do / has anyone else been through this.

1c80oky;How to get over failing boot camp (twice)?;Due-Active6354;I’m 25 years old, and I’ve been struggling with coming to terms with failure since I was 19, or even younger than that. After going through a bitter home life through high school, I applied myself to join one of the many service academies in the USA. I was tall but generally weak at the time, never played sports at all in my life, but I went to the gym pretty consistently. Got the nomination, got the test scores, but unfortunately wasn’t selected. It was fine though, I thought, I could just go to college and commission later. Long story short, I got to college in the middle of nowhere Arkansas with only 300 students, and hated every second. I ended up dropping out during the 2nd semester due to being too depressed to even go to class, to join the army. I thought it would make me tough, make me into a man… but it wasn’t so. I scores very high on the asvab test, but my physical abilities were non existent, and the recruiter essentially lied on my physical fitness test prior to shipping just to get me out the door. I knew what the standard was, and he basically told me to lie if anyone asked any questions about it, and I agreed. I thought that it would simply be fixed at boot camp. I sign on with a combat MOS, get shipped to Fort Sill in the summer of 2018, and I struggle with the initial PT test, failing every event including a near 10 minute mile run time. The DS tried to motivate me for sure, but eventually I had to profile as my right leg was beginning to fracture, barring me from the runs. I got ridiculed by the DS, I got ridiculed by my platoon, but I completed every event except for that. But I was still profiled and eventually got booted when they forced another PT test in the final phase. Failed the run by 3 minutes, was kicked out, and shamed for not being “motivated enough”. MRI’s were done, multiple fractures in my leg, got chaptered out. From then on I was completely depressed, drifting between jobs while I lived with my parents and was often scolded for being lazy. After being fired from 4 different jobs I settled down into a job throwing bags for an airline, but I knew I wasn’t happy due to what happened. I was going back to school at community college with my father’s help, and eventually graduated with an associate’s, but I knew I wasn’t really happy, and it didn’t do much in the job market. After a couple years I decided maybe I should give it another shot. I sold a lot of my belongings to pay for a personal trainer that I saw for over a year, and I saw some real improvement with no real problems with my leg, and managed to pass the navy’s standard pt test before once again signing the dotted line in 2021. Unfortunately my trainer, who became my friend, died by self harm only a couple weeks before I would ship out, and I missed his funeral to go to basic, promising him that I wouldn’t fail this time…I got kicked out of the navy within 3 weeks, fractured my leg again to where I could barely walk, and they wouldn’t let me stay in the rehab unit despite my requests. I was in the separation unit for a couple of months then sent home again. I was beside myself with grief more than before, not wanting to face anyone I knew that had anything to do with the military. I could tell they were all ashamed of me, so much that my dad decided to send me to my granddad’s for a month to get away from it all. But my granddad was a navy veteran, and I knew he was disgusted. Eventually I came back, had a falling out with the parents due to “laziness”, and started going into manufacturing. Come 2024, and I’m a certified robotics tech, working at a successful car manufacturer after moving across the country. No matter what sort of success I have though, I feel like I’ll never be able to get over the past failures, cause it was something I wanted so desperately but couldn’t have. Sure I get paid well now, but whenever the military is mentioned I only feel resentment, especially since nearly all of my coworkers are veterans. I always have to be careful what I say around anyone, knowing the current ridicule I face in the workplace would only get a million times worse, and so too would my feelings about the situation. Even when I see military movies, or see them in public, I just inwardly cringe to myself, downright hating veterans at times despite knowing that this is entirely my fault..What would you do in such a situation?;I’m 25 years old, and I’ve been struggling with coming to terms with failure since I was 19, or even;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;1;1;2024-04-19 16:08:27;2024-04-19;Friday;16:08:27;4396;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:15.886914
1c80mb2;How do I make Lasting Connections with People? ;Thurstonhearts;Hi, having a hard day. Just need some words of encouragement that things will get better.I am 27. I am very lonely at this moment in my life. My mother passed away and I miss her very much. My father also died three months ago. I have cptsd from childhood. I am in therapy and have been for years and am actively working on it. I have worked really hard to move through college and now have a good job. I have a good living situation too. What I don’t have is family members or community. For the past year I have been trying to change that I joined a few clubs, made some new friends, god its too much to really list but I have been trying REALLY hard to build my tribe. I know it takes time and I must acknowledge I have had some success (starting to form a bond with a few people I met) but overall I just feel like its not working much. I also feel othered from people or dont understand social stuff.People say I am super charming and I make friends easily but keeping them? People dont reply even though they say they wanna keep in touch, so I think its just to save face. People for reason dont like to hang out in the winter and turn down plans or dont bother to create them. Alot of people dont initiate and dont stay consistent. At the end of the day who knows whats going on in others lives, so I cant judge them. But its so painful. I also see alot of people have connection through partners or parents of childhood friends. Due to my background i dont have childhood friends. I dont have parents or family, Im estranged. I had a gf but we broke up and i havent met anyone new.  I feel like the culture in america is finding connection through these three type of relationships. Most people Ive connected with i feel get their connection needs met through above so they dont really need friends. I dont have these things so friends are everything to me. I dont know what to do. I dont know how to make it better. If I need people to change this but people dont need it too.  What do I do? Am i just doomed to a lonely life because of my upbringing that i cant change?  I am just so fucking sad. The other things is I have friends but I dont see them often. Everyone is busy and capitalism keeps use drained. Plus they have partners (and my best friend suddenly when she got a bf last year I havent heard from her. Everything just turns to the partner. What if someone us dont want that atm?) and are busy i see them like 3 times a year. Like no one seems bothered by it but me. Now i just feel like this weirdo and everyone around me has their chocolate bar and im just standing in the corner by myself. If anyone has any advice to get out of this please help me. I dont wanna be alone all the time. I work alone i come home alone. Please. Should I look into alternative ways of living and join a community or? Thank you.;Hi, having a hard day.

1c80m5m;Why can't people follow simple instructions ;ADHD_Misunderstood;"So. I'd like to preface this story by stating I was a Masaage Therapist til the Pandemic put me out of work. And a damned good one. Anyway. My back was killing me this morning. So I decided to ask for a little bit of help. I went to my mom and asked if she could assist. I told her I'd lay on the floor with my head facing toward her. And all she had to do is put her heels on the spaces between my shoulder blades and spine and slowly push forward applying pressure. And asked her not to put pressure directly on my spine. She agreed, and the moment her heels got onto my back she completely throws my instructions out the window and starts doing fast circular motions with her heels. Very hard. I said multiple times ""ow please don't do all that extra stuff"" and she just kept going. So arrogantly sure of herself that she was just going the extra mile. Then. She puts pressure directly on my spine even tho I specifically said not to do that. After fucking my back up repeatedly she finally does what I ask which at the moment seemed to help tremendously. But now my back is killing me even worse and I'm 100% sure it's because she ignored my instruction. See the thing about deep tissue massage is it's meant to be slow and steady. If you are doing rapid deep work the muscles will only tense up and not release. There's a lot of misconceptions about deep tissue work because usually when you injure somebody it feels better... temporarily. Because when your body experiences immense pain it releases endorphins. If you've ever heard stories about people getting shot and not even realizing it. It's like that. Your body basically sends emergency painkillers in very painful situations. Which makes a lot of people think that good deep tissue is supposed to hurt. It's not. A little bit of pain is normal. But as you ease in the muscles are supposed to relax and the pain should start feeling just like basic pressure.Anyway.... I'm pretty fucking pissed off that she ignored my expertise and just did whatever she wanted and now I'm in pain because of it. She was trying to help and I'm grateful but like my God why the hell aren't you listening to me, you paid for my education. Like. I can only assume she thinks I made the instructions sound simple to make it sound like less work for her so she'd be willing to do it when in actuality I made the instructions simple because it already is simple. I asked for exactly what I needed. Nothing more. Nothing less. And she took it upon herself to go ""above and beyond"" even with me repeatedly asking her to stop. I just dont get why people can't listen. I haven't mentioned to her that she fucked my back up yet. And I don't know if I will. Cause I feel bad about criticizing someone who was trying to do me a favor but holy shit I am mad about it.";So.

1c80etd;(CW: past suicide attempt, past self harm) Please help me navigate this: I work in healthcare. In one month, I'll be having surgery at the surgical clinic I work at to remove orthopedic hardware from a suicide attempt many years ago.;-smells-fishy-here-;"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post. Overall, I'm thrilled to finally have this surgery. A fantastic surgeon will be working on me. I work at a surgical clinic in the pre and post areas (not the OR); I'm very close with the nurses and know the OR staff in passing. So, I'm terrified of being vulnerable as a patient, and I want to prepare myself so I'm not thrown off.The actual attempt happened long ago in a different state. I'm allowed to look at my own medical chart at my workplace and there is nothing glaringly obvious on my profile - the page is pretty bare - but this may be because my job doesn't require extensive historical information so past information isn't automatically populated. I'm worried my nursing, physician, and anesthesia provider coworkers will immediately see this information.Of course, it's possible to look back at that encounter (10+ years ago) and read what happened. It is also fairly easy to scroll down through encounters and just see the title/reason for visit. For ortho hardware removal surgery, I don't think it's really relevant to know the reason my leg broke. And likely my coworkers won't be digging aimlessly through my chart, bc they'd be pretty conscious it could violate HIPAA (it might, it might not, depending on if the accident itself is relevent)The surgeon and surgical residents might know the reason my leg broke when they're getting info on me and planning the case. I'm uncomfortable with this but they're not people I interact with a lot and I trust their professionalism. They're humans so they might be surprised and it might stick in their minds as interesting, but I wouldn't expect them to talk about this outside of any critical medical planning. I'm worried my clinical profile will be memorable enough and they'll always think of it when they see me. I seriously doubt there would be anyone who would need or care to gather this info; but it could be possible for them to know my story: My mom died of an sudden cardiac arrest when I was a teenager, then a month later I attempted suicide resulting in massive injuries (this was 10+ years ago). A few months ago, we were all shocked to learn that aactually a genetic heart condition caused her arrest. I also have this condition (my heart is totally fine, but they will likely know about all this and run an EKG on me). I'm worried this is all unique enough to remember.Regardless of what's seen in my file and whether the surgeon includes the reason of my injury in his notes, I need to prepare an answer when people ask ""How did you break your leg""? I will not go into detail, but I usually white lie and make it vague.  50% of the time people ask more questions and I awkwardly say 'it's a long story' to shut it down. The way I explain it is awkward and the vagueness implies that I was at fault or maliciously reckless in other ways. I'm not a good liar, and I don't have a good lie to tell. I feel trapped if people ask me what happened.Finally, OR staff and my direct nurse coworkers will absolutely see SH scars on my upper arms. Unfortunately, I had a SH injury a few months ago on my forearm that doesn't look like classic SH, so I made up an completely fake story bc the scar gets pointed out and asked about constantly (by everyone, everywhere). I'm worried the context of the upper arm scars that are super obviously SH gives context to everything. The upper arm scars are pretty bad. I would NEVER judge anyone else for having scars, but I just feel so sad that everyone will know this about me the second they get a blood pressure. I feel so exposed and I hate it :( Also, I think this is less likely, but I'm a bit scared I'll say something embarrassing or have flashbacks when I was up from anesthesia.I guess I'm calculating the outcomes of my coworkers knowing these things about me. For sure they will see the scars; unsure on the rest. Professionally nothing will change. And I'm able to choose which nurses take care of me- so I'll choose people who I feel comfortable with for maximum privacy. But I feel so disgusting at being 'found out'. That's the only word I can use :(I know I'm managing other people and not my own emotions about all this... But it's the more salient anxiety. I want to have a story for the reason my leg broke that sounds believable. And I guess I just want support and advice on how to feel about all this. <3 <3 Thank you for anyone who read this and responds, it means so much.";I'm not sure if this is the right place to post.

1c80akm;How to deal with the fear of loss?;HighDoubts;"So, I have a cat. She's really sweet and affectionate, but she's also very old. 21 years. She's essentially been an ""old cat"" for a while, and for about 5 years I've been feeling a constant sense of anxiety whenever I see her, thinking about how it might be the last time I look at her.Today she's been spending a lot of time near my desk, which is unusual for her since she usually likes to stay in a different room. I just can't stop thinking ""does this mean she's about to die?""I know it's normal and a good thing to care for one's pet, but I feel like these constant thoughts fixated on death are unhealthy. For the past five or so years, for example, every single time I saw her sleeping on the couch, I thought ""that's it, she's dead"" until I could see her breathing.It's consuming all my time with her. I know that death is a natural part of life, that I should focus more on treasuring my time with her instead of obsessing about how much time we have left. I know all of that, but I can't help it. Knowing things doesn't stop the feelings nor the anxiety.Does anyone have advice on how to work on this? I'm planning on telling my therapist about it next week, but in the meantime I thought I'd ask here.I should probably add, I'm autistic/asperger and struggle with emotions a lot already.Edit/update on the cat's status: we took the her to the vet today, looks like she probably has a brain tumour causing her epilepsy. We don't think she has a lot of time left, so if anything, this is very much a time to be concerned for her.

1c7ywt0;Seek for help for my mental health.;hsisisisississ;Hi everyone, just started to use reddit. I'm actually only 14, but i want to seek for some help because of my mental health. Last year, in December, I started to get traumatized by some contents on Tiktok. The content is mostly about people that committed su1c1de, and some people kinda posted some stuff related it. One of the most triggering one for me was about a teen girl that took a photo before her death, which is actually pretty popular. However, as the photo is just a girl talking a selfie, but I do not know why it is so traumatizing that actually made me feel anxious about. During these months, I have been dealing a lot trying to control, or use some tools on my browser to stop myself getting information about that person. I know it sound extremely funny and ridiculous, like why the hell someone will get trauma because of that. And yes, its been almost 5 month, and I still did not escape this fear. I actually cut myself a lot and thinking about killing myself because I really hate myself, the way I am, and why the hell am I the only one having weird issues like that. Everyday, I will feel extremely anxious, stressed, and uncomfortable, just because of that image. I even deactivated my Insta account, a lot of websites or apps that are easily able to search up that thing. Until now, I decided to take some actions that I am not quite sure if it is effective or not. So basically i decided I will just keep look at that image whenever I want, and maybe one day, I'll find out that there is nothing scary about it. And of course, my very supportive parents helped me find some therapist and stuff so that I can go back to my regular, positive life. I hope someone can give me some really beneficial ways to let me reduce my stress, overcome this issue..

But there is one I have gotten extra close to let's call her Matilda and I kind of told Matilda how that I liked her best friend (dramatic I know /s) This was in mid March and I started liking our friend the switch of the months of February and March. But yesterday for funsies I told Matilda that she got an ""promotion"" and she now had the privilege of telling people that I liked someone but not WHO and she forgot it today and I just reminded her inte middle if day because it was a reason I got Matilda the ""promotion"" and she did her job to first our friend who I like that I'll call Stephanie and Stephanie of course had question but fantastic Matilda helped me not say to much. Then later at lunch it got worse it was us plus one more and Matilda did her job again and they started questioning me and of course thanks to Matilda they didnt milk to much out. But after lunch Matilda listened to music and so did everyone else but me and Stephanies laptops were broken and we talked and she tried to see if it was okay for her to ask questions because she is the sweetest then I let her and she asked questions but the problem with me and yes no questions and secrets is that I do not like to lie or it taken out of context and she has narrowed it down to 4 people including herself.But back to the real problem after the lunch it was like my brain got completely quiet and I can't really feel emotions anymore and this is coming from someone who has LOTS of feeling and has A LOT of things going on in her brain and this just freaks me out, like why and how do I stop it. I can't go into more details because I am not feeling anything and a lot of my communication is described and played with emotions and it makes it hard.And before anyone says anything I know I am stupid for this whole thing and it is just le to blame.

1c7x5ap;My mum makes people think I'm a horrible person;someonenothing2;Social service woman came and I want to vent.My mum makes people think there's something seriously wrong with me, I'll start off saying I know I'm a bad person and there probably is something wrong with me, but not the things she says about me.Firstly she says I'm unstable, violent and need help, this is because I used to throw things in my room when I got upset (never at her) but she'd occasionally throw things directly at me, like the candle holder and a random piece of wood one time lol. Always me who's violent, I don't get it. Throwing things is the worst I have done if that's considered worse than swearing at her or not giving my phone to her.One time I heard her say I attacked her, istg I never ever hit her, never. Even when she pins me to the ground and hits me in the head over and over, I always try push myself away from her grasp (grabbing onto furniture and dragging myself out rather than pushing against her). That's not to say I'm perfect, I've done horrible things, but I've never been 'violent' or 'attacked' her like she says.Oh btw, she also said we go outside on walks to the beach, forest, etc. that sounds fun! EXCEPT FOR THE FACT WE NEVER HAVE. -_-Because I drink, self harm, run away, I'm already seen as hard to handle, I used to be good. I'm not anymore. I'm still good most days though, I only go down to eat for dinner and smoke, those are the only times she sees me and I see her nowadays, I keep my room clean and I shut up most of the time (Except for when I'm talking with my brothers), but you know what she said to the social service woman? She said I NEED a LOT of ATTENTION. She said she was feeling dizzy and sick because of having to stay with me CONSTANTLY.WHAT? She sleeps the ENTIRE day, I've made it my goal to be as little of a bother as possible, especially with the things she does for me, I understand she cooks, I was gonna say cleans but she only does that when ppl come over lol, but I still appreciate that! And she has a house for us, pays the rent, I can't ask for anything more. I actually don't and never have, I've NEVER asked for food even when the fridge was literally empty, I've NEVER asked for objects or things like a new mouse (mines broken xd) but she makes it look like I'm constantly asking for the WORLD.  edit: this is not to say i like her any less/appreciate her any less, i know that i'm not a good kid & i'm trying to be better, im just venting.;Social service woman came and I want to vent.My mum makes people think there's something seriously w;Venting;2;2;2024-04-19 13:39:35;2024-04-19;Friday;13:39:35;2426;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:16.939111

I believe he's very mentally challenged due to many betrayals and traumas in his life. as for my mother, we weren't close growing up but now we are friends. even my brother and sister love me despite my father favoritism towards me. i am sorry for the long explanation about my family I just want to say that my life is mediocre, average, not very good, not very bad, I'm broke but I never went to bed hungry, always have a shelter, my parents can have very few flaws like any human but they love me at the end of the day. as for social life i had a crippling social anxiety as kid, I used to hide behind my mom and go mute around strangers I wasn't capable of speaking, and now it's kind of better, when I actually do speak some people like me and become my friends but I can't for the life of me form connection with others without wanting to kill myself. i just always feel uncomfortable, empty and unreal. i don't know how to describe it. anyways after almost any friends gathering i end up feeling like a fraud and deep loneliness.I just don't understand, I always feel something is very wrong with me i don't know what. i feel like I'm attracted to sadness, darkness and the need to be treated badly. do I have a victim mentality? why am i like this? i don't understand? do i want more from life? less? i know I have enough but i feel like deep down it doesnt feel this way ever. what is it that makes me feeling so very empty and mediocre i feel so less than anyone and i shouldn't feel this way because my father and mother are better than most parents I know,  even my siblings, even my financial status, my looks, my knowledge but yet i feel like im the most inferior, ugliesy person on earth and it makes me feel even shittier because i know others have it worse, I don't even have it bad,  and i should be grateful. and I am very grateful most days and i am very adapting but some days i feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me and I feel harrowing emptiness.;i have a very mediocre life, kind of paradoxical at least that's what i think, at this point I'm not;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-19 13:37:54;2024-04-19;Friday;13:37:54;2549;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:15.854480

I alr make sure I don’t look fatigued or depressed anymore like just how?On one side ye sure it’s obvious cuz my mental health has never been cool for a few yrs now.

We legit abt to go on holiday to one of my fav place in the world I’m genuinely excited to go there. How can I be depressed over it.My mental health often has this kind of relapses like this since I started high school. Just every 3-6 months, I would went into a period of being insanely depressed. Probably cuz school, who knows. The thing here is I hallucinated stuff with it. Voices often come up in my head when I was sleeping. I’m pretty used to having voices in my head cuz ADHD so it’s just my voice. But during these periods other ppl’s voices it is. The 1st time was a slowly builds up of many different screams of both men and women just right at my ears with a stinging continuous wooden table knock. They said something but I forgot. The 2nd time a women voice just chanting bullshits at me. The 3rd time, just a month ago, my cousin's voice and my teachers voices, all at them scream at me to burn to death. twice in a single night. I'm not suicidal actually, or do I? Rn I'm sure I'm not tho.I used to suspect that I have psychosis man. Or even worse, schizophrenia. I talked to my school counselor abt it and she said ppl with psychosis most of the time they are not aware of their delusion. Well, I'm clearly aware of my hallucination so I put that thought aside pretty quick.I never told her abt my thoughts abt schizo tho.I often write abt what i feel at the present somewhere online cuz my memory is very not good. I think there is still texts of me talking abt my 1st hallucination somewhere with details.Ik reddit is not somewhere so u can self-diagnosed.

1c7wqjg;I was shot by the SWAT team in Canada and find it hard to cope. I now develop VR apps to help others suffering from PTSD and other conditions like mine... ;Gold-Profession-9667;"Why am I finally opening up and telling this story to the world now? I don't know.I was scared, but now I am not.Maybe people deserve to know now. I’m no longer afraid of talking about this.For five years up until today, I was so afraid of what people would think, I guess. Today is the day I come clean. It’s Friday, April 19th, 2024.I don't have many friends left here in the UK since I returned, and I spend all my days now working on VR apps.It's become my life’s work. Both apps I have created are designed to help people find inner peace and calm. To help people who have suffered from PTSD like me but to also help anyone that wishes to relax and find some inner peace.WHAT HAPPENED IN CANADA FIVE YEARS AGO?I was going through a rough patch four to five years ago when my wife left me and constantly called the authorities on me when things broke down, in an attempt to get me removed from the country I loved, Canada.I traveled there from the UK to be with her for our final two years together (we were together for five), but I developed bipolar disorder and started to suffer from ill health. Unfortunately, she didn’t want to stick around.She had a right to leave if she wanted to, but I hoped she would have been stronger, not listened to her father and brother so much, who were overly negative about me throughout our relationship.I had no idea why, even to this day. I treated my ex-wife as well as I could, but I guess it wasn't ever good enough for them.I still am struggling today, but it has gotten a bit better with time. I have almost come to terms with what has happened almost five years later. Almost.One night, the door of the apartment swung open, and I heard my ex-wife calling my name. I was just so happy to see her back home safely and to hear her voice and that familiar tone.Instantly I was greeted by two police officers who ordered me to get on my knees. In a state of shock, I told them to leave; I was not a criminal and had done nothing wrong.They were quite trigger-happy and shot me with a taser for my trouble, and it was the most painful feeling. I could do nothing but shake uncontrollably in pain.This wasn't the end, however. They forced me against my will to go to a hospital where I merely existed for months and months and was locked inside.She told me over the hospital phone that she did not love me anymore. In an instant, I lost everything.The doctors at the hospital didn't care, so I had little choice but to walk the same corridor each day, wondering if I was really insane?It took so much to find a lawyer to come to my aid. The lawyer found the hospital had done something wrong with my paperwork, and I was immediately discharged.Several months had passed by that time, and I never got a chance to see the sky or hear the birds sing.I returned to our apartment and took over the contract so at least I wasn't homeless for now.I did feel like it would be better if i wasn't around. Life was unbearable.One night after weeks alone in the apartment, I sensed a strange energy. It was oddly quiet outside my door. I knew something was up. My sixth sense was telling me there were police outside. I called through the door to ask if anyone was there. No reply.It turned out my ex-wife's family was fully aware that I was released from the hospital, and for some reason, they called an entire SWAT team for me. How lucky I was, outnumbered more than 7 to 1.I didn't leave the apartment for many days, sensing but not really knowing what was on the other side of the door. I called through the door offering to make them cups of tea, etc. I said I wanted to talk and there had been a real misunderstanding. I said I had done nothing wrong, but I was just greeted with silence.Finally, after four days, I opened the door and was immediately shot by the SWAT team for a second time. I was alone, unarmed, but still they didn't talk; they just shot me. They started cutting off my clothes and then gave me something that made me hallucinate.Then they sadisticly asked me to walk to a stretcher where I stated I had been shot and couldn't walk properly (I still had cables from the taser trailing from my leg). Apparently, I left this conscious world for three days under the influence of what they injected me with.I woke up in an operating room with tubes and began to panic. I started trying to remove the tubes, and they put me under again. This  time I woke up in intensive care, handcuffed to the stretcher. I felt like a criminal, but I had done no wrong. I was deeply hurt, angry, and lost.Again I was taken to a locked ward where I walked the corridors again for many months more, wondering what I had done to deserve this, my visa running out. I was so distraught that one day I decided to try and escape when visitors came for the other patients (I had no family there in Canada and was completely alone).I made it through the closing door to the other side before another patient dragged me back inside into the ward that had become my prison. He hated me and would often make nasty comments. Some people have issues, they just cant get along with others.I had to fight to get him off me for my freedom, which didn't last long. A grand total of 10 seconds.As a result, I was punished; I wasn't allowed out in the enclosed courtyard like the other patients. I could not hear the birds sing nor see the sky again; I was trapped.Again, I had to find a lawyer to help me fight the case that I should be allowed to be free. In the end, I had to use cunning to escape, as I knew my visa was due to run out. I told the doctor it was running out ""next week"", and by keeping me here in a locked ward would result in me overstaying my Visa. They quickly released me after that.I returned back to the apartment to find it had been trashed by the SWAT team. I remember before they forcibily injected me, I told them i just wanted to listen to my music and to be left alone. The cut all my headphones cables. I still don't know why they did that. Was it sadistic? I have no choice but to say it was.I tried to harm myself after what happened. I don't want to get into details but it was a painful exsitence. Eventually I relaized it was not worth it.I cleaned up for what felt like an entire week and took my bike to the nearby trail.I loved Canada for its nature; it was a beautiful country I so badly wanted to call home. Having been incarcerated for so long, I couldn't stay inside for long.The sounds of birds finally greeted me, and the air felt fresh. I valued my freedom so much by this point. I decided my first app would pay respect to the Canadian forests that helped carry me through depression.I rode my bike every day through the forest. I felt inner peace and calm. I felt relieved; nature was so beautiful and pure. When my visa eventually ran out, I had put in over 1000 miles on the trails on my own. The forests in Canada became like a second home to me. I wanted to give back.I wanted to help people that had suffered like me. I returned to London, UK, with a heavy heart.My support worker in Canada had to escort me to the airport. I didn't want to leave. Canada had become my home; I thought I would stay there forever.I’ve lived in London, UK, now for almost five years. I have very few friends, keep to myself, and cannot afford to go out. I am now disabled with PTSD and bipolar disorder and unable to find work. It felt like a natural choice to change careers and become a student VR developer. ""Forest Chill"" & ""Zen Garden VR"" are Oculus VR apps I have created to help people like me, but it's also now my life’s work.To help those that really see the value in an app they can open anytime and start to find inner peace. It is my hope that nobody has to endure what I have. Every day I am working on making my apps better and am most open to feedback and changes. I often ask people for feedback in the hopes of becoming better. I am no expert in VR development, being self-taught, but as time progresses, the apps will get better.I still find it hard to cope but I hope that my story will help inspire someone and I hope that my work now will help people across the world.Thanks for listening to my story and your consideration.Peace & Love Always.";Why am I finally opening up and telling this story to the world now?

1c7wjz9;Every post;BusySteak2;Every post that I see in social media regarding men’s mental health always says these cliches.Every post has this sayings which I think are cliches because it doesn’t really have an impact on me the way it can unto others.Every post says “go to the gym”. I go to the gym, but I don’t want to. I have never lifted a single weight in my entire life. I am just forced by the internet and my friends to do it. I may strengthen my weak body, but in the end I will always have a fragile soul and thoughts, and nothing is ever gonna change that.Every post says “find a job, earn some money”. I try to apply for a job, but all I ever got is either a rejection or a no response. I don’t know what I’m expecting when I have never worked a single second in my entire life.Every post says “workout and lose weight”. I am trying to lose weight not because I want to, but because I have to because I hate the way I look and how unhealthy I am.Every post says “its up to you to take care of you”. But I don’t want that. I want someone who cares about me and loves me. But it’s really hard to accept that there will always be someone who is willing to do that for you when you can’t even begin to like yourself.Every post says “all you need is yourself”. But I don’t want that either. I don’t know how to feel good about myself so why should I be just by myself. I am a lunatic and a fanatic who is constantly needing for reassurance on every head turn. I need someone to atleast make me know who I am. I want to be independent, but I don’t want to feel alone all the time.Every post contains these cliches, which I tried because it’s based on the experiences of others who struggles or have struggled with mental health. But I figured that I do not have any motivations to do these things unlike them. I was just finding a distraction to, I guess not kill myself.;Every post that I see in social media regarding men’s mental health always says these cliches.Every ;Sadness / Grief;0;1;2024-04-19 13:11:54;2024-04-19;Friday;13:11:54;1848;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:15.857185
1c7wep5;Partner mental health issues straining our relationship.;Parking_Driver_991;Hi everyone,I (M/28) just want to share something personal about me. I am not even sure where I stand. Me and my girlfriend (F/27) have been together for 8 years now.It wasn’t always easy since she is hard to open up to someone new. I am her first partner.We have been living together for 5 years now almost.There was ups and downs in the relationship itself. But since 4 years ago since she graduated Uni everything kind of changed. The relationship went to the extreme, it is either very happy or very sad. She couldn’t find work for a year and finally good a job that slowed kills her deep inside.  Last year I nearly died due to sickness and she helped me get back to my feet. She had to balance between her job, me and her mental state which worsen due to additional family problems. a couple of weeks after I manage to survive my sickness and starting recovery, she decided to quit due to work abuse and stress as mentioned before. So I decided to quickly get back to work since we will need the money. And so I did.Sometime after that she struggled with finding a new job and lost her purpose quickly which leads to a critical depression state with a lot of episodes. I tried my best to support and keep things stable. But I am only a human and of course makes mistakes which leads to her exploding within seconds.I convinced her to go to therapy, and she finally did. It seemed to be a progress after sometime because the frequency decreases.The problem is only every time she explodes it is either she left the house and I have to worry where she went and if she is not in danger or I have to leave and wander around the streets while still having to go to the office tomorrow. I suffered also professionally due to this. Lost a lot of self esteem and couldn’t differentiate if I am in the wrong or she is just not being rational.It has been almost a year now that I covered all her basic needs and could barely save some money for us.Today she had her episode again and I am on the streets. I really couldn’t make it into sense. Is this her Metal illness or is it just her? Did I do something wrong or is she just being irrational? For example she demanded that I help with house chores on working hours. Cooking for her during working hours. And I do help with house chores and cook for her. It is just I couldn’t do it within working hours. She does all this anyway saying that she needs to because she doesn’t contribute financially. But I never asked her and always try my best to come home early. But she still demand me to do the same. I am in a state where I don’t know what is going on in my life. My best isn’t my best. I am wrong all the time. I should help when I can, but I also can’t do it myself.Sorry for venting out. I cannot explain this to any friends or anyone. Because they don’t understand and I also have less friends due to the caretaker role.I do really love and I am committed to help her. But somedays I am just shaken and couldn’t stand on my feet. And got no one to lean on.Sorry. Thank you.;Hi everyone,I (M/28) just want to share something personal about me.

1c7w2sk;Am I Just Being a Brat, or Does My Mother Really Know Best? A 19F Struggle with Overbearing African Parents;Signal-Animator-7464;I'm a 19f with African parents, particularly a mother, who makes it hard for me. I'm not allowed to date or have friends I live my life differently from people my age completely isolating. I'm not saying I want to go out there and have sex because that's the first thing that comes to her mind when I tell her that I wish she'd let me socialize more. But I also feel like it's too late for that because now, even if she were to let me socialize, I don't even know how to. I don’t even know where I’d start from. My life is limited to school, the grocery store, church and home it’s like a simulation. We don't even do any fun activities as a family. Every day, 24/7, at home, staring at those beige walls drives me insane. I've had lots of off thoughts not just because she doesn't let me socialize, but mostlybecause my life is the same routine every single day - wake up, eat, bed, sleep. Idk what I’m living for. There's nothing interesting or entertaining in my life.  The only form of entertainment I have is my phone, and she knows that and uses it as a weapon against me since she bought it. Sometimes she takes it away   from me.Because of this, I have a hard time socializing. To the point where even if she were to give me freedom, I don't even think I want it anymore because I wouldn't even know how I’d use or where to start. I'm so used to rotting in my bed, rotting in my house. It has made me so lazy. I don't want to go out. I don't want to move. I don't want to do anything. I used go to school in person but because of everything, I decided to start taking my classes online and staying at home because I don't like going outside anymore.I can’t wait to move out but I highly doubt she'll let me if l wanted to. She is so in control of my life. It's so draining. I always try my best to follow her rules mostly because she’s my mom and also because I want to make her happy but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do it willnever be enough. I’m a whore a terrible daughter regardless of me being a virgin.  Sometimes, I do understand how mothers do not want  their children to grow older, but I also feel trapped.How am I 19 years old and you still want to keep buying me panties? And since I didn't like the ones you picked for me, I want something different, more adult-like.You get mad at me for being a I’m I being bitch and don't know how to appreciate my mom being nice to me. And that she really knows best and I’m still too young to realize it yet.I really don’t want to end up like my mother I love her dearly but her lifestyle if so depressing I js hope when I’m in my 20s she’ll probably start to see me differently;I'm a 19f with African parents, particularly a mother, who makes it hard for me.

1c7vu1l;Do you think you would have FOMO if you closed out all of your social media? I closed out all of my SM on February 20th.. ;LeningradNo7;"I have since opened a reddit account on April 1, 20224 but this is annomonus....February 20th I closed out my Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - anything that had ""friends"" and my name attrached to it, I got rid of. In fact, I even got a new phone at that time and with it, a new number. I only shared that number with my employer and my elderly parents. I didn't make an announcement. Nothing says cringe more than posting on Facebook that you're closing out your Facebook account. I've never known anyone to succeed at that. The people who do well without Facebook likely never had a Facebook presence anyways. Why do it? Two reasons - the first was it seemed like every time I vented about something in my own life - it was met with either people thinking the post was directed at them or weirdly attacked me (my own family and friends) For example, my expensive bike was stolen from inside my apartment - I posted that bc I had video of this person and the low life is on probation as it is, this would be a simple police report to file and investigate. One person said, I should just accept the loss and move on - another said ""It's people like you that ruin cities like ours and like San Francisco."" What?!? And this was a friend of mine and my parents and siblings. You file a police report so that people who are considering buying a home in the area have an accurate idea of crime. You file a police report when a crime happens so that your city knows where to spend it's resources. Plus, I still don't understand what they meant by San Francisco. This lead me to my second reason for going offline - your online presence is not real. Take the bike for example. People looking at my life think I have it easy- I make good money. It's just a bike. What they don't know is that it was my transportation. I have panic attacks and they are worse when I drive. I don't talk about it and I don't share that I don't have a car any more bc it was too much stress for me. So people think I just bike for fun and not bc I need it to get around. And why don't I talk about my anxiety and panic attacks? Well, I did once and ""friends"" asked ""why does a cis white male even have panic attacks?"" Am I happier now that I can't be found online? Not happy but I'm no longer disappointed by people I considered to be friends. I do have FOMO. I fear the death of someone I know or their family members and it would be something I would want to know about. So...  somewhat. Has anyone given it up for good?

That being said, I have very little independence, and I rarely leave the house, and I never leave the house alone. (I live with my parents.)

I saw my therapist today,and I kept apologizing to her, because I felt like I wasn't a very good patient, I suppose.

1c7uoi9;"TL;DR: Am I going crazy or is this just a quirky coping mechanism? Or even a form of schizophrenia, 19F with no friends creates imaginary social scenarios";Signal-Animator-7464;So I'm a 19F with no friends I don’t have that much social interaction due to my mom's strict rules. She doesn’t really let me have friends. She thinks friends are a bad influence. So I know this sounds weird, but because of that I've started creating imaginary social scenarios to cope with the loneliness.  I wouldn’t really call them imaginary even though that’s what they are but I'm aware these people aren't real, but it's become a form of entertainment for me.sometimes I'll imagine myself in a large friend group since I don’t have any, acting out scenarios like me, and my friend group are out shopping or we're at a party or having a disagreement fights 😭 and conflict. Things that happen with teenagers in a in a lot friend group large friend group girl drama. I'll even look in the direction of where I want to imagine whether the person is sitting or standing, even though I am fully aware and know they're not there. It sounds strange, but it's helps me feel less alone.Sometimes I'll imagine myself at a concert,club I do this mostly when I’m home alone I would even dress up with a full face make up and acting out the experience with 8d/concert music from YouTube which helps makes the scenario more realistic. It's become a way for me to escape my boring reality and feel like I'm part of something.My question is: am I just finding creative ways to cope with my isolation, which is a totally normal thing or is this a sign of something more serious like schizophrenia? I'm aware it's not normal behavior, but I'm unsure if it's a red flag or just a quirky coping mechanism.;So I'm a 19F with no friends I don’t have that much social interaction due to my mom's strict rules.;Question;1;1;2024-04-19 11:37:53;2024-04-19;Friday;11:37:53;1592;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:16.948698
1c7ujjz;How do i stop hating women, as a boring incel who maybe has autism, cptsd and aspd and negative experiences?;Tiny-Yesterday-6979;They say, go outside and interact with women to see they're not a monolith and people, but anything that i try to talk that is female turns to shit or just dead boring. Basically can't have positive experiences with them, not even platonically. Except in professional settings, i can't do much with them. I've observed other guys, but they just seem to do much better or well, when to me it's like, i'm out there to show you other guys are better.Basically anything i try to do with women is going to fail. Why bother trying cause they detect incels and basement dweleers and it's going to fail anyways.I also have a negative feeling when trying to interact with them, like i'm asking myself, what's the fucking point? Like a pressure in my chest and an intense feeling in my head, especially after talking to women.I dropped Andrew tate like or incel like content about 1 years ago but the feeling is still there. Echo chambers are enought bad, real negative life experiences are even worse.When i'm in a bad mood, i noticed that the feeling is often directed towards women, idk why. I also see men as competitors, expected for the ones in my family, they're also going to make their own families and be like, my life is with my wife and so and that man and his wife won't care about me so why the fuck should i care about some couples or a man and a woman who have their lives and families.At 1 years and a half old, i got left at my grandparents home for 3 weeks and i didn't react very well, my mother went with another man who also had a son when i was about 2 years old for like 3 months before going back with my bio father again. It was bad her relationship with my bio father but who knows what happened with that man she went with. She used to be strict, neglectfull and abusive, like at 13, she used to hit me with a broom over stupid stuff.Another belief is that women is a sort of opposite force of nature so fundamentaly different, first thing that differenciate most life forms is their gender. It appeared atleast 1 billion years ago almost as old as life itself. I see it, what's the opposite of me? Women. Atleast in our species and earth. Basicly, everything one of a specific demographic, especially sex does, it leaves an imprint in it's history.Idk why but i also have a feeling that women don't even care about their kids, that plus their attraction for the chad winners. They can even put stepkids before their own, they have much less problems raising stepkids than man. Probably something rooted in ancient evolution. When a new male mammal animal finds a female with kids, when he's going to get rid of the kids, the female won't even honor her kids, she will mate with the new male anyways. That's another of my beliefs of why women have no honor, morals, ego, selfishness. I don't like doing selfless or dishonorable stuff like putting other peoples kids before me or my kids like wtf?Also like 0 female platonic relationship, let alone a romantic relationship, more negative experiences and rejections throughout my life.Also people says go interact with them but i only reinforce what i believe and my hatred towards them so i'm like, i can't stand another time.I did that today aswell but still, negative crap like always.My social skills are so bad, even compared to other autistics, still the same problem that i just don't know how to be intresting, don't know what to say, also can't talk for very long, cause i run out of things to say very fast, i just blank and appear as weird, creppy, etc... and i believe i can't improve social skills, character, personality, it's fucking genetic, (blackpill, heh?) Neuroplasticity is the biggest BS iv'e ever heard, why i didn't see any progress?It's driving me mad up to revenge and violence fantasies. I'll feel i'll soon reach my breaking point and have nothing to lose. Also have a fantasie of getting violent if potential partner cheats or so.I once told my psychologist that i had a negative feelings towards women a few months ago but she made a face and i changed the subject cause it was unconfortable. I feel that i waste my money and time, it's almost 1 year since i see that psychologist and her advice is just like, control your inner dialogue, like how? Plus what to do againts my huge procrastination problem, when i leave her room, i feel it's going to get better but no. I can't practically do anything helpfull or do the cbt work or so.It seems i have tons of work to do and significant change won't be overnight. Like i want to see some progress, not always complain online about my problems in hope that some miracle is going to fall on the sky. My brother told me to go to Thailand soon to make life experiences and with women it's easier there aswell and people are more welcoming, etc... but how long will it take to fix that issue?What's the way out as a 30 year old? My brother told me it's already becoming late. So i'm late in the race and you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

What can I do for her and for us to not let the dysthymia to completely take over? She battles on a daily basis feelings of hopelessness and that nothing she does serves a purpose and that she's just living to get through the day with as many distractions as possible which is perfectly fine for now. She needs to process the diagnosis and to take breaks from it by watching TV or whatever.She's on sick leave meaning she spends most of her days in our home with our 2 cats. I'm diagnosed and treated for BPD and learned to live with it and found out communication is key and she shares that feeling meaning she doesn't keep everything inside. Both of us has battled with our mental health since our early teens. But I feel I'm kinda looking for solutions in the dark and wonder if any of you have any advice or anything really for making it possible for me to be the best support I can be both in the long- and short run and also advice directly to her.

1c7tano;I don't have confidence I'll ever be able to have friends like this again and it scares me;camelseeker;"For quick context, I [M22] lived with parents from birth - 18yo, developing unacknowledged mental health problems through it all. I left for uni in a different city and one year in I 'broke' and couldn't take it anymore. I got professional help; medication, home visits, therapy, psych ward stay. I'm now on the other side of the curve but I'm far from healthy now.I had to drop out of my studies due to health which I have managed to accept as not my fault (I have passion and ability in my subject usually). I stayed in this city though as the friends I have made here I feel I can share things with, they understand what I'm saying or if not they at least openly sympathize and are happy to talk. In turn I'm the same with them. I live with two girls right now, all three of us have different forms of mental health issues which could've made things go wrong but instead it's brought us so close together. We support each other to the end I cannot describe how thankful I am.Back in my home city, I don't know. I just don't have anything near that and never have. I'm alone in my socialisation with others whereas with them I feel I genuinely connect and understand them. I've been slowly realising what I'm gonna be going home to and I don't know what to do. Of course I'll make the effort to make new friends as well as the ones I have already there but social anxiety of course makes that an exhausting task. I woke up this morning and just cried. I haven't cried genuine tears in so long, something (depression?) always seemed to block it but they flowed this morning. Almost like I was already mourning what I'm to lose.My friends back home are almost all boys and the stereotype of boys not knowing how to talk about emotions is goddamn true with them. I consider myself lucky that I am very good at understanding emotions, mine or others, but that's not the same with them. e.g. a friend asked if I wanted to live with him when I move back. He's got low level depression so came to me for help (who else could he go to? I had no one) and I realised living with him would put me in a carer position even when I'm potentially struggling even more, due to him not thinking about my health and me being characteristically too nice. It wouldn't be good for me.I just don't know what to do. I'm aware I'll probably fall into some kind of heavier depression when I move but I think I'll get out of it again alright. I'm so scaredThe women I'm friends with back home in hindsight seem so shallow compared to the company I keep here. I'm very aware this is partly because I was too nervous to be able to express myself to anyone, but no one seemed capable or willing to listen and understand the kind of pain I live inI love my friends here more than anyone else hands down.

1c7s6lk;Wild birthday anxiety.

Invitees also include my current and ex girlfriends (I know, perhaps not great idea but now too late). I'm also at the cusp of a big career transition.Today I have woken up with a wild anxiety. I don't know why. Nothing in particular is bothering me. But I'm very overwhelmed. Party starts in 7 hours and I'm unable to eat food, sit still, or control my racing heart. It's very strange for me to feel this way - after all ahead of me lies an evening with my favourite people - but somehow I'm almost terrified of the love and appreciation I'll receive. Context if it helps - I've been living away from home for 10 years, and otherwise am a very social and extroverted person in life (though I routinely need personal space hours every week)Does anyone resonate?

1c7s4zb;Day 10 on sertraline. Changed from citalopram. Depression/anxiety;Imaginary-Chest2655;Hello, Reading other people’s stories on Reddit have comforted me in the past so I thought I’d post as I’m struggling. I’ve had anxiety since I was a kid (thought I was just a worrier until I grew up & realised it was anxiety) & I’ve suffered from depression since I was 25. I’m 34 now (female), am going through a bad patch & have changed from citalopram (20mg) to sertraline (50mg) after being on citalopram for nearly 10 years. I’m on day 9 of sertraline. My anxiety & tiredness are through the roof. I get insomnia anyway so it’s hard to tell whether it’s just business as usual or sertraline side effects. I am sticking the tablets out, hoping things will pick up.I don’t feel as hopeless or suicidal now & I haven’t cried in a week, which is something. I would never act on my suicidal thoughts but I just wished I wasn’t around anymore. When I’m not depressed, I’m pretty upbeat, appreciate the little things & have a fairly positive outlook. But at the moment, I feel drained and like I’m never going to feel happiness again. I keep thinking. Is this it? Is this life for the next 40 odd years? Stress, struggle & worry? My life isn’t bad. But despite what I have, I can’t help but feel so unhappy and I don’t know why. I feel so guilty and embarrassed all the time. How dare I feel this way, when there is so much suffering in the world. Any advice would be really appreciated.

I go through a really hard time once again so i went to see a new therapist, he diagnosed me with moderate depression and anxiety I prescribed a medication for both anxiety and depression I forgot what it was called but anyways my grandpa past away and I spiraled and turned to alcohol and I started to harm myself my life went down hill from there for the next year. It’s been 2 years since. Lately I’ve been having these meltdowns from being overwhelmed. Being a new mom, military spouse, and I have no family or support system up here on base bc we are 28 hours from home so things getting really hard for me really fast. I keep feeling like I’m going down that spiral again but keep pulling myself out, it’s getting harder and harder but then all of sudden 2 days or a week later after a BIG meltdown I’m calm, and collected confident. I feel like something’s wrong with me I’ve always felt that way because my emotion are so strong sometimes is unbearable and for things that shouldn’t be. I feel like the weakest person alive, that I’m not strong enough to do basic life things because if it gets to hard I just want OUT. Either it’s drugs, alcohol, food, or just an unhealthy lifestyle and its never easy or pretty to get out of that mindset. I know Reddit isn’t filled with Doctors who can really give me a diagnosis I’m not looking for that I’m just wanting to know is this normal? I’m going to see a therapist but I’m having a hard time trusting my diagnosis. I always feel like I need to be understood or I need reassurance once I get it I’ll be fine but then I’ll need it again. it starts to affect my day. One bad thing or thought could ruin my whole entire mood sometimes it’s hard to get out of. When I get really low I start to think about harming myself. It hasn’t gotten to that point, I won’t let that happen. I love my son to much. But I want to be better and happier less irritable.

1c7qkhh;My old friendships have made me incapable of making new friends or opening up to people;Evil_Chicken_Gurl;Whenever I try to talk to people and start opening up and acting like myself, I immediately go back to being quiet and shy. I feel like I can never get too close to others because of this, which with time I’ve learned to accept about myself. But still, I wouldn’t be honest if I didn’t say I do want someone who I can trust. I’ve spent some time to think about it and I realized that whenever I get too comfortable with people and talk too much, I get reminded of my younger self and my first friends. As silly as it might sound, they were my only true friends till this day. Or at least that’s what it felt like to me. I don’t want to excuse my behavior in any way, but I have to say I was a kid when this all happened (1st - 5th grade). I used to be a completely different person from what I am now. I was very social with everyone, and people really liked my craziness, as I am the daughter of two teachers and they didn’t think I would be trendy and cool like them (for some reason lol). I made a lot of friends in this time, I think it was almost my whole class. I even had a few girls to which I would talk every day when I got my first phone at the end of 3rd grade. But one thing about me is that I have a crazy imagination and I love making up stories. So when my friends sat around and gossiped, I of course came up with the craziest crap you could imagine. I would make fake rumors just for them, since that way they would keep me around and like me. I would also start fake rumors (like I would plan out the way everything would go) so that way it would end up catching everyone’s attention and end up harmless most of the times. That is, in fact, the only thing that I think made me cool at the time for them.Sometime in 5th grade though, when we had to go to middle school, everyone suddenly started paying less attention to me. They all had different friends in other classes, and the few left behind didn’t care about me anymore. I started getting distant, and seeing how everyone abandoned me with the snap of their fingers, I decided to switch schools (my dad taught at both, and so he helped me out very fast. He also predicted this happening to me, since apparently my parents have seen through my friend’s behavior, and dad even asked me in 4th grade if I wanted to move schools. But at the time I said no and didn’t believe him).In December of that school year I moved into a different class, where I quickly became friends with those kids. Then, for some god forbidden reason (probably some sort of stupid revenge plan), I decided to start some nasty rumors about my now ex friends. At the time I thought no one would believe me, but apparently I didn’t take the situation seriously enough since they believed everything and ran with it. It also didn’t help that the two classes already had beef with eachother, with the class from where I had transferred from thinking these other kids were stupid etc. (This only fueled me to hate them more, as I didn’t think they would be like this with others. But they were since I remember them talking badly about them). It got so bad that one of the girls came to my fence while I was in my garden and threatened to tell everything to my dad (that’s when I coincidentally realized that the other kids weren’t my friends either, with the exception of a few, since I had told them to keep this only in between us which they clearly didn’t). After that, I started to hate everyone, and even worse, I started to hate myself. I realized that this was not the way to go about my situation, but I also had my reasons, as after I left one of my dads students told him (with proof) that there were groups made since around 3rd/4th grade about just hating one me. I then realized that they had only taken advantage of my naivity, since at home I had no one who I could talk like this to. I realized that the only reason I was kept around with my oldest friends and some of my newer ones was just for entertainment. Still, it was not okay what I’ve done to them, and that’s why I decided to isolate myself from people almost completely. I needed some time to think about what I’ve done. Thankfully the pandemic came and allowed me to distance from everyone. When we came back in person to school (8th grade), I was the only one standing out in my class. I was the only one not talking or getting involved as much as the others. But I didn’t care since I would go to high school, right? I could start fresh and forget all of my worries. Except I couldn’t, since almost all of my first friends (from 1st to 5th grade) were in my class. I kept distance from everyone, and tried to be respectful to them whenever I would be forced to talk to them. I can safely say that I’m a completely different person from what I used to be.So now I can’t make friends with anyone anymore since I always remember my past when I do. I try to excuse myself with things like I was growing up or that my ex friends are still horrible people, but my mind is set to tell me that I should just hide away from everyone since I’m a weirdo. I have went through insanely hard times due to this, and whenever I get excited that I’ve talked to someone and get happy, my old friends always come to mind and get me back to being shy. I want to apologize to them, but I also think that it’s too late for that now, or that they have forgotten about it and would find it weird.

Am I delusional for not walking out of my room and socializing at a party I'm not invited to? (Even though it's my house I'm renting?) I get massive fomo and I don't know if my mental could take it. Like, they were talking about who lives in the house, and they didn't bring me up. Like if I was some sort of unnamed burden. I do have history with the people in the house for working in the same club. But i quit because I knew I couldn't take the pressure, and they were practically setting me up to quit. They treated me like a fucking tool the entire time I worked with them. They don't even ask if I'm ok? They never check up on me? They never even wondered on thinking of knocking on my door or anything to tell me. They just assumed I wasn't home. I feel left out all the time. I feel underestimated all the time. I worked my ass off day and night for that club. All I ask is for a little bit of respect and camaraderie. But no. I'm practically forced to quit. Someone please help me. There is some more history stuff about the club and etc. But I am a firm believer that everyone in that club is a no good snake, that I can't personally trust anymore. I worked so hard for this damn club that I got 5150 during the week and they STILL didn't know. Talking about worth. They never need to know but it pains me to leave a club that drove me to such suicidal thought. Why did I even get the vice president position? To me it felt like a joke No, it was a joke. My opponent ran as co-president and refused to be presidents without eachother. They won. I lost. The day after when they are signing the papers, they tell me I get the position. I am so confused. I am the only one of my grade to even join the club. Im in the big gap of age in my club. A kid made me make a cosplay suits of armor without paying me. The kid said it wasn't his first time making cosplay. (But his skills says otherwise?). The cosplay isn't finished and we show it off at a con. My coworker wins. He gets mad for not winning. I'm ecstatic that my friend won. Later on we are with another mutual friend. He litterly disowns me right in front of them. (Dafuq????) He took my credit for the cosplay in front of me and my boss. (Like literally why?). He makes me form text so his girlfriend wouldn't break up with him????? I was a fucking fool for thinking this guy was anything good. that wasn't my place to help him.

1c7q4s0;Need advice so I can help a manic friend;Throat_Most;I have a close friend who happens to live in my building who I fear is experiencing an extreme manic episode. Her close friends and coworkers are deeply concerned and now management at her work place has expressed worry. We have tried to talk to her saying we love her and are worried but she won’t listen and reacted angrily and refuses to talk to anyone who brings it up. This unfortunately isn’t an isolated incident. Before, I was able to talk to her and she was able to snap back but it’s fair to say at baseline she can be…”untethered”. I’ve consulted with a couple professional psychiatrists, in which they advised that I call 911 mental health service f she doesn’t elect to seek help herself (which I am confident she won’t).  This feels extreme but I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel like she is going to intentionally harm herself or others but she is not of sound mind so might do something that might cause harm unintentionally - not just physically but might cause irreparable harm to her career and relationships. Has anyone recovered from a manic episode and can speak to how they recovered and what helped? Or if you have had experience with a loved one, I’d love to hear about how you navigated it and any advice you might have.

She doesn't try and frighten me or manipulate me. No guilting, none of that.I truly believe she'd never hit me. And rather than wanting to get away, when I'm with her I really don't want to be anywhere else.I haven’t told her everything but I mean, it’s obvious if you spend enough time with me that I'm damaged. Maybe one day I'll tell her more. When I’m ready.I feel I can relax with her but I guess I don't really know how to be somebody's girlfriend. I've never had a healthy relationship before. I don't count abusive relationships as actual relationships, as it gives those monsters too much credit. I could use a bit of advice I guess. I'm hardly the first person who's been in my shoes, or at least similar.People who end up in abusive relationships can find someone who would never dream of hurting them. After all, one of my favourite comic book characters is Harley Quinn. Starts off in an abusive relationship with the Joker, who's well, a monster. But eventually she ends up in a much, much healthier relationship with Poison Ivy.""Harlivy"" is probably one of my favourite couples in fiction.So I guess you could say I finally found my ""Ivy""And well...I haven’t the faintest idea what I'm doing. It's one thing to be able to lower your walls, trust someone and let yourself be vulnerable. It's another to know, where do you even go from there.Because of where I live, and general prejudice that also exists here, therapy is unfortunately not an option. When I have tried it, it's gone pretty badly due to these prejudices where I live has.Long and short, trying to get therapy for the DV leads to the therapists instead wanting to interrogate me about my gender identity, with some going as far as to trying to encourage me to ""go back to living as male"" given I'm a trans woman.

I thought sure, whatever, it’s normal for some people online to make fantastical things up about themselves. however when he asked me to join the discord for his chess club I was surprised. This guy types in long run on sentences, and it’s entirely nonsensical (to me). He types so much stuff every day all day. It’s hard to represent with a few words, but it’s just like an ai trying to string together sentences from different conversations. Sometimes he types in encoded language (numbers) too, hence his typing seeming robotic and very cryptic. He makes up exaggerated stories in his head of certain situations. I can’t go into detail about it, but he often repeats himself about past petty disputes. What confuses me is that he just seems like a normal quiet guy over voice chat but the more I interact with him the more I wonder if something is wrong or he’s just eccentric?;Made a new friend through a chess club game, we spoke about religion for awhile and I thought he see;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-19 06:35:38;2024-04-19;Friday;06:35:38;1116;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:43.160185
1c7pzoo;I’ve been saying the wrong things lately, how to move forward? ;Naive_Worth_8353;I don’t know why, but lately it feels like I’ve just been saying the wrong things to people and I’m accidentally hurting them in the process. I think what I’m saying is fine in the moment, but then when I look back on my phrasing or tone, I realise what I was meaning to say didn’t communicate well or sometimes, my heart wasn’t in the right place. For example, I was in the living room and my friends were watching the movie, “how to train your dragon”. They know it’s not a movie I like and asked if I would like them to change it and I said to keep it on, to not worry about me. As I was watching it, I made the realisation as to one of the reasons why I don’t like it as a child, it has a very muted colour palette and as a colourblind person, everything looks monochrome at times, which doesn’t appeal to me personally. Except, I didn’t say that. I said “oh that’s why I don’t like this movie! It’s too grey”, which comes off as a criticism and one of my friends was already having a rough day, so once I realised what that sounded like, I apologised and explained that it wasn’t a criticism at all and I wasn’t trying to ruin her movie! I just realised why I felt the way I felt about the movie, and didn’t vocalise it well. Another example, I was at school and two seniors were complaining about a teacher I will be having next semester. My friend next to me told me that I should ask them how he’s like in classes so I can get a better idea and I agreed, I would’ve like to. But for some reason, I was feeling super shy at the moment and couldn’t bring myself to ask, so she offered to ask for me. During her talk with them, she called me out about how scared I was to ask them myself twice, to which I jokingly responded “you’re so dramatic!” Later on now in the dorm, she brought up how funny I was being, how shy I was, how that’s the shyest she’s ever seen me, and I got oddly defensive and said “it’s not even a big deal, you’re exaggerating” to which she got upset and I realised I was not being fair. She did me a favour by asking on my behalf and I can’t take a joke without getting defensive, when it’s true, I was very shy and I have no idea why. I guess I would just like advice as to what to do. Part of me is like, maybe I should just shut up and not talk to anyone so I can’t say anything messed up again, but I know that’s not realistic or healthy. I don’t know what’s gotten into me lately, I just feel like such a terrible person and I hate that I’m acting this way and upsetting those I love around me, and I don’t even know why I’m being like this. I just, I don’t know how to move forward from this and I’m scared I’ll say something stupid again.

I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness although I sort of feel like I have symptoms of adhd and other things that develop from that (and I am ALL for it but I still cannot get over certain stigmas and also would feel bad for my parents) so I just cannot bring myself to get help. I'm only 17 but I feel like this isn't normal, for the past 2 years of my life I just am always so miserable, especially during my years of highschool. I come from a very amazing family so I feel like I am a pretentious piece of shit for feeling like this but everyday I feel so much shame and general depression, I don't know what to do, everyday feels like actual hell, I can't make any friends, I am always sobbing at night wanting to disappear. Got rejected from colleges that seemed like a supposed way out of where I lived and maybe a chance to experience something new to help but I got rejected, which further increases the general shame I have for myself I feel so conceited but I feel so much shame internally I can't make real friendships and when I go to school I just compare myself to all the people who seem so happy, perfect and just living a generally good life. I eat lunch alone so I study but I can't seem to be good as everyone else.  I don't want to talk with relatives either anymore, ecspecially because I didn't get into a good college, I am ashamed of myself even more. I am always so alone and everyday I wonder what the point of it all is. Really, nothing gets me excited anymore. Not even a new TV show or book. My parents are sick of my depressive state and I feel so incredibly bad. I want to be happy, I want to be smart and I want to have friends but I feel like it's just not possible for me. I know I am so so young and I have so much life ahead of me but I cannot imagine living like this for the rest of my life. I just cannot. I try to be happy, and I enjoy making others laugh, and am happy for people with a good life, but a deep part of me is insanely jealous and I wish I could be worthy of everyone around me. This all just doesn't feel normal at all. I just feel dumb, weird, and disgustingly lazy as I lie down to calm myself.For the past 2 years I don't know what went wrong but should I consider doing something?

The people that will be there are hard party people (like… not just alc and w33d) and I’m afraid of being overwhelmed, panicking or having my trauma triggered (by someone throwing up). Last time my trauma was triggered was 9months ago and I still have flashbacks… like maybe it would be a little different bc I’m not so super close to these people but I’m still so afraid bc if I have a panic attack, there’s no place for me to go and I don’t want to disturb the party with that, neither do I want other people to necessarily know about my vulnerability           In addition to that I’m currently not interested in any drugs (neither alcohol, even harshly reduced my w33d consume) and, whilst these are really nice people, I would feel kinda isolated or afraid of being mocked (not in a bully way but just “friendly mocking if you know what I mean).

Now I'm panicking. ;called-out;I have had depression diagnosed for over a decade.In the last 6 weeks, there have been a string of high stress and upsetting events. To sum up - Bought a house, house needs to be unpacked and there are mounting repairs to do, partner had a mental health issue and can no longer contribute to domestic work (like all the cleaning, unpacking, and needed repairs) for the foreseeable future, my dog of 12 years was put down due to oral cancer, mounting critisim at work due to performance decline, several family events I am expected to host and prepare and, finally, as a cherry a cancled camping trip.I've been coping as well as can be expected, if I say so myself. This weekend is my last family obligation. I am not ignorant to how this is taking a toll on me. So, I used all my saved PTO to schedule a camping trip for myself. The trip was to a free dispersed campsite. Everything was very carefully calculated to reduce cost and strain on my partner.

1c7p1y9;I think I need inpatient help, how do I know and what do I do?;SeaTax6039;So, as the title suggests, I (21F) am not doing well. Half the time I think maybe i might possibly potentially perhaps I need inpatient help, and other times I'm just about ready to kill myself. I know I need more help than I'm getting (therapy every 2 weeks or so). I don't know why but suddenly when I see my therapist I feel like I'm fine, and I'm just being dramatic about how poorly I'm doing. I think I might need inpatient help because, well, I've gotten pretty suicidal. While I haven't tried to take my life, I have definitely gotten close and have even taken a few extra pills. I'm not happy to admit this. I feel crazy. I've also become insanely angry and anxious, even though I'm on Effexor. I'm severely burnt out and touched out from my job as a daycare teacher. I used to be praised for my patience and compassion, my nickname was Angel for fucks sake. Now I can't handle certain kids coming up to me for hugs. And todsy especially, I lost it and screamed a few times at a few kids. I want to cry just typing it out. I'm snapping at every single little things and I feel like I'm someone else entirely. I also havent been able to sleep before 4/5am in months, and this is with effexor as a sleep medicine. I want this to end, any way I can get it to. My boyfriend wants me to go get inpatient care, and I probably should. The two of us also compiled a whole list of changes. I can post it if needed.I'm worried about going and getting help for a few reasons. 1. I'm in college, and I have a presentation Monday. I don't want to get a 0 or let my partners grade suffer (after she basically did all the work already, something I've cried many times about). I know, it's stupid.2. I work at an understaffed daycare, I recently missed a lot of work due to my boyfriend being in the hospital and myself being sick, with a cold and potentially a stress induced seizure.3. My parents. My parents are very much of the belief that nothing is wrong, and that while mental health is real, it's not real for me. They accept I have adhd and anxiety, but my dad has denied my diagnosis of depression since high school, and my mom just thinks I'm lazy and dramatic.4. My parents are against missing any work or school. Even as a kid I was never allowed to miss more than one day of school, even if I was throwing up with a fever. This hasn't changed, they were pissed at me for missing work the day after my seizure. Keep in mind I had never had a seizure before, and rhe brain fog, migraine, and soreness was keeping me from leaving my bed. The next day, I was guilted into going to work even though I was so lethargic I felt like passing out.I'm concerned about my parents because I still live with them rent free. I get that I'm an adult now but I can't stop thinking about going and coming home to my parents being disappointed in me. I want help so bad but I'm so scared. I don't want to be suicidal and angry anymore.;So, as the title suggests, I (21F) am not doing well.

1c7p0r8;I’m going through an identity crisis. I view what I should do with my life and what makes me happy as separate things.;FederalYak407;I literally realized this just now. I don’t know what I want to do for a living or a career or even what makes me fulfilled anymore, nor what kind of people I want to associate myself with. To give some context, I was a professional dancer for a decade. I participated in dance teams, went to competitions, and eventually got a job as performer while working miscellaneous part time jobs on the side until I got fed up with those jobs that didn’t align with my passion within a year or two. During the pandemic when all dance studios were closed and people were dead scared to go outside, I isolated myself from the increasingly paranoid and deranged public and my own family. Where my narcissistic mother would run the house and instigate fights and drama with everybody that lived with her (myself, my dad, and my sister) while my two other siblings were already moved out and sides with her since they didn’t live in the house during this time. She told me not to work because of my sick sister at the time which I only lasted for a month and she made me immediately take a shower and Lysol my clothes as soon as I walked in. She served my Dad divorce papers right before Christmas and lied to  everyone that he was a drug addict and it nearly drove him to suicide. I finally was able to make a decision to leave this dysfunctional family behind in May 2021. I quit my grocery job in January and was taking my time while dealing with my Moms temper tantrums which were exacerbated when she had family and friends over. I moved to Florida into a cheap studio apartment in a bad neighborhood and immediately got a job at Publix. I was mostly unhappy and unfulfilled with the job mostly because of the coworkers and not knowing how to stand up for myself after years of narcissistic abuse until I transferred to another store and things got better there. I was saving money, focusing on my health and finances, making friends somewhat, even though I was still being excluded as I wasn’t part of the good ol boys club despite being cool with most people at my job. I moved to the local college town thinking would hit it off in making friends but the store I transferred to was a mess. Terrible management, Lazy coworkers, you name it. I was given the worst job in my department and was kept back there until I quit by not showing up to work. I went looking for other jobs in sales being enticed in potential to make life changing money. Only to be dehumanized again and ripped off by shorted checks, long commute times, and memorizing a shitty script that would put off any normal human being. When I quit that job I was ready to give up on life. I’ve tried everything only to get fucked in the end. I took a cybersecurity course that only lasted a month because they wanted me to take out an $18,000 loan. I worked at Amazon from October to December and got fired for reporting a safety issue. I’ve been applying for jobs since January and was rejected by every single one so I’m doing go work full time. I figured my next option would be to join the military but of course my Dad is not supporting that decision and thinks it’s a waste of my time but I don’t see any other way out of poverty besides going back to school with a grant and he doesn’t realize that online courses won’t get me a job and any field since he’s a dance teacher for a living. So I don’t think he wants me to be doing better than him taking on a job that has more responsibility than his but at the same time I’m only basing my decisions on a career based on money and a superficial association of interest. My dad insists I should keep dancing but I don’t see the point given my current situation and the fact that it doesn’t make me money anymore. I’m almost 28 and I’m lacking my own identity because of my piece of shit fucked up family.;I literally realized this just now.

1c7on9n;Why am I still here;ViktorVaughn0;I'm tired of pretending. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Although I didn't always know what it was. The first time I remember recognizing it was when I was 14 and woke up one morning with a deep wave of sadness that I couldn't shake off. I just kept crying uncontrollably and my mom got mad at me for crying so much. From that day on it felt like there was a hole in my chest. I would get panic attacks regularly and didn't know until later on when I went thru therapy and found out what I was experiencing wasn't normal. I like to think I had a normal childhood I had parents who cared for me. We weren't wealthy by any means but they always made sure we had something to eat and I can't hate my parents for providing for me. But they were never attentive to my emotions, something I found out thru therapy. I was always called sensitive or cry baby as a kid for letting these things out. As a result I never found a way to express my emotions in a healthy way and this only got worse as I became a teen and descended into depression. I found ways of getting thru it with drugs, alcohol, self harm. Problems with the law and broken relationships followed. This all culminated in my first suicide attempt at 19 and it wouldn't be the last.Knowing me in real life you could never guess any of these things about me because I got good at hiding it all. My coworkers and friends see me as an optimistic positive person because thats how I present myself. But I know I can't pretend when I'm alone at night and that hole in my chest reopens. These days if I don't take some sleep aide I won't be able to sleep for more than 2 hours at most no matter how exhausted I am. I don't talk to anyone about these things because even now I hate when people worry about me. I'm 25 now, in a better place than I was a few years ago. I haven't fully given up but I'm just tired and at this point it feels like I won't find any rest until I'm in hell.;I'm tired of pretending.

I've tried all of the common advice like journalling, self affirmation, etc but none of those methods have worked for me. I feel I have a deeper problem than writing on a paper can fix and i don't really know what to do. I can't call a warm line because my mother would know and that last thing I want is to worry her, I have no trusted adults besides her to talk about my burdens to, (and if you wonder if I'm overreacting I really do mean none) therapy is too expensive, and I don't have a car because insurance is too expensive and getting a job would put me in a worse place mentally.

1c7ofj8;Can anyone help me stop my bad vivid dreams?;worriedButtcheek;I (20F) have been through a breakup(last month) and something traumatic too (in Jan). I haven't processed it well enough at all. I have tried to , the traumatic event was okay by itself to deal with, but the breakup happened because of it, which I am unable to deal with mentally. I have been really stressed lately, one of my exes( not the recent one) has been bothering me even after blocking him off everywhere. All of this led to a bad sleeping schedule. I sleep around 2-3am , one day even 6.30am , and i sleep about 4 to 5 hours which keeps me tired.The reason why I don't like to sleep is because of my highly vivid dreams. I have had vivid dreams all my life, not everyday though, and good ones or really random ones with space and shit. But they've changed now.Last night, I retired to bed at 11pm, which made me fall asleep at 12am, woke up at 1.20am again, and then at 6am and then finally woke up at 9.45 am(still tired). And throughout I got terrible dreams, about 7 of them in one single sleep. Not one of them was good, one started off good, but again ended up being horrible. Its been one month since the breakup and recently, I have started getting more and more of him, he was a part of the dreams , in 3 of them. He's a nightmarishly terrible asshole and I wont go much into why he is that. I did love him a lot, like I have done so much for him , got like 0.01% of it back. In essence, I don't want to get back with him, just the memories and the trauma of him overall, instantly after the breakup, makes me sad.   I got one with my friend in it, two with my family and one with a friend who has betrayed me ( but this happened in September) and one where I am trying to stop the urge of self-harming with a pair of scissors( clean since mid-Jan though)I have been diagnosed with Bipolar and Depression but that was 3 months ago, now to top that I have got anxiety too. I am barely able to focus on shit. i cannot sleep without a podcast on, and I am terrified of sleeping. I did yoga once before sleeping, that night too , I got one with my ex in it. I have a difficult schedule and I have exams upcoming too, so maybe I will journal if I find time. But I don't want to end up crying.Can anyone give me legit advice how do I stop my dreams?

My GF at the time, who has BPD, made me feel a type a way no woman I've ever dated has made me feel before. There is no word in the English lexicon that I can use to describe how hurt and disgusted I was with myself because of what she made me believe. In November, as our relationship was coming to an end, I had to come to terms with reality and drop a very important class I need to take(I got my master's, but am back in school for pre-med). It took so much out of me to actually go on the school's site and click drop, but I was just not able to do it, and I was eons behind in the work. This, coupled with the flak I was getting from my ex, sent me into a spiraling depression, one that I haven't experienced since I was probably 18(I'm 28 now). After pretty much forcing me into therapy, several months of having to heal from the wounds that were inflicted, I am retaking Organic Chemistry again, and I managed to get the highest grade in the class. I can't express how happy I am that my work paid off. Seeing that I'm not a complete and utter failure as I thought I was, it's so nice to see something tangible that shows me that I can do things once I put my mind to it;Rewind back several months ago, I was in the midst of dealing with a toxic and abusive relationship.;Good News / Happy;1;2;2024-04-19 04:47:58;2024-04-19;Friday;04:47:58;1279;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:18.200755

1c7nyq2;My ex ruined my life;caidus;"I got with my first partner at the age of 24. I dated a lot of beautiful girls in high school but I was suffering sexual assault at home at the same time and that impacted me. I isolated myself at the age of 19. (suffering cptsd, major depress. panic attacks).    I had a crush on her for a while and was talking to her for a while. I stopped talking to her at one point as I became very suicidal. 6 months later, she invited me over, we had hung out before, and she initiated sex with me, even though I tried to stop her. She kept saying she loved me while we had sex.    I got a massive promotion into a new job that was years ahead of my experience and I was so grateful and happy and I loved the job. She started making me miss work and go in late. Once she said she thought I was going to crash so yelled at me for hours not to leave, stating that if I left I was breaking up with her. My boss told me to leave her. I was also going to get a rental, moving out my parents, but she convinced me not to (saying she didn't want me to have a house I could invite girls over to). She ended up making me lose my job due to attendance. I tried to hard to get that job back.    The next day (maybe) I went to her place and she said she didn't mean it and doesn't remember having sex (I later found out she has a bad problem with drugs, I didn't know she was intoxicated at all). But we kept hanging out and having sex (my first sexual partner) and I wanted to be in a relationship with her, she was hesitant but we started dating (dated for a little over 2 years and it was hell). I loved her so much, and still do, I admired her and would have (and did) literally everything for her. We stayed at her home, which was very, very small in a beach town (she was on welfare and occasionally cleaning for income) and I was working full time and I spent every cent on her and we had a lot of fun times.    About maybe 3 months into the relationship, I received a phone call from my mum saying she was getting out of prison (she was incarcerated for 17 years for murder of the person who red her, I was raised by a very loving grandmother and father and I am a very good person), it was obviously great news she was getting out, I had waited my whole life for her to be released. Immediately after the phone call, my partner said she was breaking up with me. I didn't understand. I was heartbroken, and the next day with a broken heart I went to pick up my mum and we spent time in the accommodation she was given. A day or two later, late at night, I received a phone call from my partner and the words she was saying just didn't make sense. She went on about hiding a gun in the engine bay of a car, she was saying all sorts of stuff that didn't make sense. She started saying stuff that was hinting at her being SA'd, she ended up saying she was SA'd by 3 people. I tried to get her location, but she didn't know where she was. I called the police to get them to find her. I was over an hour away from where we lived and a few police cars came to my mums hotel room (she just got out of prison and it scared her to have the police there) but they checked my location and I ended up speeding to get up the coast. Her phone called me and a male answered, I was very shocked and asked ""who the fuck is this?!"" and he identified himself as a Senior Constable and I apologised. They found her nowhere near where she said she was (over 40 mins) and took her to hospital. I have the officer the details and names she gave me. I went to the hospital they took her to and waited all night. I was on the phone with her, when she first went in she sounded extremely intoxicated and not aware of her surroundings, after being treated she started to sound very sober. I was on the phone with her the whole time and kept telling her and the nurse to get a rpe test done. She said she would but ended up refusing in the end.    The next day I tried to take her clothing to the police station and have them tested. I contacted the police a few times, by the end of it they said that she is the one that has to report it.    This was 2 years ago and I am still traumatised. For months, whilst having sex with her I kept having vivid imagery of people raping her. It made it impossible to have sex. She later said that nothing happened and she wasn't raped. But I remember the horrifying phone call. Much later, towards the end of the relationship she said that the person who raped her was a ""good guy who works for the government who was just trying to show her something"", he was a drug addict. This is baffling. Throughout the relationship she claimed to have schizophrenia and would accuse me of horrific stuff all the time.    After this, she got back with me and she stared to get verbally and physically abusive.    In the next few months, it was common for her to break up with me for a day. Clearly to have sex with someone else, and then get back with me.    Her verbal and physical abuse progressively got worse and worse. She would abuse me in public, embarrass me, spit on me, scream, hit me. Every day for the remainder of the relationship was filled with worsening physical and verbal violence. At a young age my dad said my mum abused him and he didn't call the police as he was 'protecting her' and I took this mindset in. I hoped that she would just stop. I came from a home where I was verbally and physically abused in my family home as an adult, unable to leave due to income and gained disability.    6 months into the relationship, leading up to Christmas, she purchased a lot of drugs and everything just became a chaotic nightmare leading up to Christmas, over the holiday period and into the New Year. She just absolutely destroyed any type of a good holiday we could have had. Police started coming to the residence often. Elderly neighbours took me in during a violent episode and the old man said that his sister was schizophrenic and she killed herself, he told me to stay by her side. I took this on board and tried supporting her more loyally (as if I wasn’t already treating her like royalty). After months of worsening violence, in one instance I snapped and retaliated. She got me charged instantly. Now I was on bail and there was an AVO protecting her. Her abuse and violence got much worse as she now knew she had a lot more power over me. Her violence became significantly worse. She tried hitting me with her car several times. On several occasions she scratched my eye whilst driving, out of nowhere. Once we were on our way to be with my family and right before we turned into my street she scratched my eye was hard she could and broke my sunnies. This was doing highway speeds. She said she thought I was going to hit her, which just wasn’t the case we weren’t arguing. I was never a threat to her, I was a victim to her violence. She often hit me whilst driving at highway speeds and tried to get me to crash, grabbing the steering wheel. Later in the relationship, everytime we were in the car (we were regularly travelling an hour each way), she would scream at me the entire time. To the point where I told her I wasn’t going to allow her in the car because I can’t handle someone screaming at me for two hours. It made it dangerous to drive. She agreed but always as soon as we got in the car she would start an argument. What a nightmare.    Many months passed and I ended up being sentenced. I was spared jailtime and it was recognised that she assaulted me first and was regularly abusing me. The AVO no contact was still in place and I kept asking her to change it so we could legally hang out and speak, as we were everyday anyway. She obviously didn’t need protection from me (I needed it from her). She manipulated me to buy her a super expensive ring to prove something (I can’t remember), which I did and she called me cheap because I purchased it with afterpay (I was on welfare at this time and it took up a significant portion of my money) and she still didn’t put in the application. She did end up putting in the application and I went to court a few times and at the last second she removed the application, knowing that I was in court and had to stand up there and speak to the magistrate. Months passed and I finally got her to put in another application to vary the avo. She was using the AVO for power, I was constantly in fear she would just call the police and I would be locked up, even though she was abusing me. I could never get help. At the court date she cried and screamed, it was a nightmare but she finally went in and changed it. Typing this out I am so stressed because every second the relationship was unfair. It consumes my thoughts every day.    After the AVO was changed she kept abusing me. I started snorkelling/spearfishing again and took her to the beach for us to have a good day. She screamed at me the whole way in the car, screamed at me the whole way up the beach, so I just walked a head of her. It was so embarrassing and I was worried people would think I was the bad person! We walked the kilometre up the beach and the conditions weren’t great for snorkelling so I wasn’t going to go in. We started walking back but she was screaming at me and starting to hit me, there were people around and they could all see this. I walked a head of her, and she ran up behind me and I jumped out of the way and she yanked my bag from my hand, to which I put up no resistance. Everyone could see this. She kept screaming at me the whole way back and into the car and I started recording on my phone. She was screaming at me in the car. We were driving at 80km/h and she grabbed the steering wheel we almost went head on into a van, it was so close, I out muscled the steering wheel. She grabbed my sunnies, hitting me in the face and once again scratching my eye lid. So many times she tried to scratch my eye out. I have a scar on my eye lid. Now that it wasn’t illegal for me to be in her presence or talk to her I could finally receive help for being abused and called the police. She was charged.    This was about a year and a half into the relationship and the entire time she was cheating on me and using drugs. It destroyed me but I always forgave her. But I suffer PTSD from her cheating on me. I loved her so much and thought she was the most perfect person and she was having sex with other people. Before I was sentenced, I didn’t trust her and booked in an STD test and in between booking the STD test and being tested, I started gaining symptoms. She gave me an STD. She had sex with multiple other people and gave me that disgusting disease. She gave me chlamydia. How could my first sexual partner cheat on me dozens of times and give me an STD, I feel horrible.    We were still together and I started working on myself and started a garden and chickens. She ended up being sentenced and there was an AVO protecting me now and I contacted her to start hanging out again (I started an SSRI and it was making me really horny) and she was homeless at the time so I wanted to help her. We went to stay with my mum (as my dad didn’t want her in the family home because of how badly she was abusing me, even having me charged). After a few days my mum kicked her out because of how badly she was treating me and my mum didn’t like it and didn’t think it was right at all. I ended up staying by her side as I was the only one with a car and we were a while away from home and I loved her. I called up the government agency which gave us homeless accommodation for a night. She convinced me to only say it was for me, so only my name was in the system and they didn’t know about her. We got a hotel room and for some reason she unlocked her phone and said I could look through it, I didn’t ask to look through her phone. I noticed her talking to more men and having sex with them. I lost it. One person was under the age of 18 (she was 25) and I started calling her a pedhile and she became super unpredictable and violent and started bashing into me horribly saying that if I kept saying it that it would ruin her next life (schizophrenic delusion). I became very scared of her after that as that was horrifying. Luckily I had an appt with the gov agency the next morning and I took all of my stuff tried to leave and she kept bashing me and was holding me in the hotel room and ripping my clothes off me. (Over the 2 years she ruined dozens of clothing items whilst being violent, she would always rip my jumpers and shirts off me, I got so sick of it). I finally got out and I felt lucky that I had the appt. I told the lady at the gov agency what was happening and she said she would tell the hotel workers to tell her to leave and that she wouldn’t get the police involved. If the gender roles were reversed police would definitely be involved. If gender roles were reversed she would be I jail for a long time for physically and verbally abusing their partner for 2 years. She left the hotel but had some of my belongings and charger which I needed so I got her to come back. I was in homeless accommodation for the next few weeks and she was came and went (hour away from home). In the homeless accommodation she would abuse me and every one could hear it. I ended up leaving the homeless accommodation and going back to dads with my partner and she kept being violent and abusive. At this point I didn’t want to have sex with her at all. She kept having sex with other people and I just wasn’t interested. Whilst at dads she kept being violent and abusive and dads a cunt too so he would rev her up and stoke the fire. I ended up finding the home that I am in now. We were going to live in it together, a farm house. I wanted the space for my chickens and a garden. It was a 4 hours, one-way, trip to inspect the home and I told her I wanted her to come with me but not if she was going to scream at me the entire time. She agreed not to fight with me but that’s exactly what happened 4 hours of her screaming at me. It makes it dangerous to drive. Half way into the drive she once again hit me in the face whilst driving and broke my sunnies, I called the police but didn’t want to wait on the side of the road so kept driving. Her behaviour didn’t stop. We went to inspect the home and by that point it was too late and too dangerous to drive back in the dark due to the wildlife. We opted to stay in a local hotel. This is an extremely small town where everyone knows everyone. She was screaming at me outside the pub/hotel and pulling my shirt and I was struggling to try to get into the pub where hopefully she would stop abusing me. When I got into the extremely local pub, a few locals muttered that she was no good for me. I went back outside and a local woman and her daughter came up and started defending her, I explained to them the situation and they became very sceptical and walked away. A few months later I went into the pub and the publady asked me if I was still with her and she said “good”. We drove back the next day and I spent the next few weeks preparing all my belongings to move. Because of the abuse I started telling my partner that I didn’t want her to move out there with me because I couldn’t handle the abuse and stress any longer, it is such a peaceful and quiet location. She agreed she would get better but didn’t show any improvement until just before we moved. I ended up calling police a few times as her behaviour was never changing and it was having a significant toll on my mental health. I never made a statement to police, even though she was breaching AVO. Before we were meant to move we were going to get my fridge and other household items, and her household items (but she had my household items) but every time we went to pick them up, I would put the trailer on, we would drive and she would start abusing me and it made it impossible to go and pick them up. She had given all of my belongings I bought for our home over the years, to her sister. She cheated on my on the bedroom furniture I bought for us. She had sex in a bedroom I purchased for us! How fucked it that.    We ended up moving and now we had to drive long distances because we were in the middle of nowhere. She kept abusing me in the car and abusing me in the home. I couldn’t allow her to ruin another great thing I was doing for myself. And my last counsellor kept telling me to call the police on her. So I did. It was causing me a lot of distress because I would talk to my counsellor for an hour about how bad my partner is and then go out there and love her. We weren’t having sex at this point because I was disgusted by the cheating. I called the police and she left the home and was later charged. It went before the court and I was dragged through hell in that court, she was manipulating me even then.    From the time we were homeless to moving into this home was the last few months of the relationship. At some point in there she was sending me very large paragraphs which I never read. I never read them because in the past she was always accusing me of horrific, delusional things, and getting me to apologise for her abusing me. Accusing me of cheating on her, having sex with her cat who was also a shapeshifter. But in these paragraphs she expressed her feelings and said she only wanted to be with me and only have sex with me. I never read them because I was so stressed out from her abusing me all the time. I haven’t spoken to her in over 6 months. I tried to get the AVO changed several times to which she kept denying. I have tried contacting her by making new accounts. The entire relationship she had me blocked on all social media, it was embarrassing.    I still suffer nightmares of her rpists. I have nightmares of her and me constantly having to stop her from cheating on me. Recently I have had dreams where I am in a relationship with her and can share my love with her, they are comforting dreams and it always sucks when I wake up.    There is so much I haven’t included of physical violence, verbal abuse, hiding drug use and cheating.    I am becoming as suicidal as I was prior to the relationship with her. Despite being an attractive, intelligent and gentle man I have never even ‘matched’ on a dating app for many years. This has caused me to absolutely give up, I don’t even look at women anymore, I don’t recognise their beauty, I have lost all sex drive and don’t mbate.

1c7nrqs;What’s the point of life anymore? What can I do?;Sharkraider552;Well that basically sums it up. While at work today i had some downtime between emergencies and something clicked in my head. Im not sure if it was a good click or bad at this point. I found myself staring at the back of a machine and did not move for 10 or so minutes because i had a mental waterfall hit me hard and the only conclusion i have is what is the point. So a bit of background , I am a 39 gay male that lives in the southeast. I work for a car parts manufacturer currently at 32usd per hour. The job is easy once you know whats going on. Im a support person basic job description is make machine go after they break either from mechanical or programming failure. Most days its fairly chill. My direct boss is good no complaints for the most part. Today while i was having my moment staring into the abyss i realized ive had the same routine since this year started. Get up waste 2 hours go to work for 8.5 hours. Get off and waste 6 hours till bed then repeat 5 days a week (sometimes 7). The start of the year the powers that be decided that instead of 4 days 10 hours and OT if ya wanted it. 5 days and mandatory OT on the weekends is better. Suffice it to say it sucks. The only family that cared was my grandmother and covid took her in April 2020. My mother was at best an absentee parent and at worst guilty of neglect. My father stopped caring when i was 12. The last time i seen him was his dad’s funeral. I get along with my co-workers but I’ve learned to not share. my head it says they truly don’t care so why bother. A few times a group would talk about a dnd group. Or chill after work or jump on discord game go to the gym, restaurant after work, whatever. Id reach out but get shut down with excuses “we don’t have the space, we are only setup for the people we already got, you would hate it, maybe next time, ect”. So i just stopped asking. My last serious relationship was 2009. My last date was so long ago i don’t remember. And my last sexual encounter was also years ago mainly because my self confidence doesn’t exist nor self esteem and the prospect of facing rejection would probably be the end. So I’m lonely af. Scared to reach out because every time i have i got my hand smacked away and I’m not sure what to do now. I go to bouts of depression and anxiety to being numb and feeling nothing. It’s mostly numbness or sometimes i feel like a puppet and someone else is moving meI don’t know if this helps or hurts. And I don’t know what do. The formatting of this is probably going to suck because i got off wrk and have been sitting in my car in the parking lot for an hour just typing this crap out. God knows the only thing at home for me is to waste 6 hours till i come back to wrk and the same parking lot.;Well that basically sums it up.

1c7nqbg;Could I have a mental illness? (explaining my childhood trauma and symptoms);Classic_Variety_1223;For context, i’m going to list a couple traumatic things that have happened in my childhood which could’ve caused me to be the way I am:- My sister was disowned at 10 for being gay (she was 17, I was 10). I had to cut contact with her. -I myself am a gay man, and knew it since I was 7. Growing up in a homophobic religious household and country I always knew i would leave at some point, which is why I essentially cut my emotional attachment to anyone i knew when I was 9-12.- At 12, my best friend found out I was gay, so not only did I lose my best friend, I also lived in fear everyday that I would be outed (thankfully he didn’t out me, and years later we became best friends again). Having to live in fear of my life ending if I was outed was another reason for me to completely suppress my emotions.- At 12 I was groomed online by a man in his 30s.Outside of that, I wasn’t abused and just had emotionally neglectful parents.- As i went through my teenage years, I realized I was growing differently than everyone else. My emotions were so repressed and I was neither happy or sad at any point and just felt numb. I figured they would would come back eventually and it was just a “depressive phase”.(symptoms) I am now 18 and:- I have almost no empathy or any emotional attachment to anyone.- The person each of my friends and family knows me as is all an act. - I have no motivation or goals in life, it feels like a routine.

I just had my psychiatrist of 10 years drop me as a patient after i told her that her telling me to ""grow up"" was inappropriate and that i was LOOKING for a new therapist.

I should also mention I am on disability and diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, i have the shittiest insurance there is in the state, and i've been searching for someone in network for months with no luck. i found a therapist online and messaged her and was super excited to start with her but she was out of network, i told her i was willing to pay cash for a good doctor, and she set me up with an appointment. tonight she proceeded to message me saying that she cannot have me pay out of pocket because she would get in trouble with the state. i don't know if she was telling the truth but i give her the benefit of the doubt that there's some issue with charging people on disability cash... i'm just completely hopeless and so ready to give up and i've gone to therapy and psychiatrist for years but i've never found someone actually invested or who seemed to want to help me at this point im wondering if everyone just wants people with borderline personality disorder to off themselves so no one wants them as patients. what do you guys think? this is a drunk rant ok bye!";Keeping in mind I'm from Oklahoma, dumbass capital of the world.

1c7n7bu;An Overwhelmed Pre-Med Student With a Messy/Unclean Apartment ;SeesawSerious81;Hey everyone it’s final exam season and I finished two of my tests already. I am a student in canada who’s from the middle east (missing home can’t wait to go back in 9 days but it’s also overwhelming). I order food a lot and I get too lazy to throw the bags out that I used up a whole room to gather them there until it’s time to get rid of all of them. There’s also gathered dust in the corners of my apartment, hair where I do my hair, and a lot of fruit flies (it’s under control now since I sprayed and made a trap but did not get rid of the takeout bags yet). I have a lot of laundry to wash, I have to pack 3 bags for my trip back, clean my 2 bathrooms, wipe, dust, and get rid of the crazy amount of takeout bags/ empty packages/ boxes. I would like to have my boyfriend over on the 26th of April the day before my trip back home since I literally haven’t let him in in the past few months because of the state of my apartment (we always go out or chill at his). Now here’s my issue, I have an exam tomorrow and my last exam is on the 22nd. These are very important exams and could determine my fate in this program. My lovely man told me there’s enough time to clean, pack, and have him over before I leave. He also told me to come over once i’m done with my daily dose of cleaning to watch our show and help me unwind (he lives in the same apartment complex as me). I have the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, and possibly half of the 26th to have my apartment ready for him to come over and to finally leave for home. He knows that I have to clean but doesn’t know how messy and crazy my apartment is. I have never left my apartment for more than 2 weeks but I am leaving for 3-4 months this time so i’m also overthinking about what could happen if I don’t deep clean. I do not want any of my friends to help me because I am genuinely embarrassed. I always look put together, smell good, is ACTUALLY clean but not my apartment (apart from my bedroom/living room).I don’t know what to do I feel so stressed out. I know i could clean it by myself because i’ve done it before. For reference, I live in a two bedroom two bathroom apartment with a living room and a kitchen. Please let me know if i’m being realistic or anyway I could get out of my head :(;Hey everyone it’s final exam season and I finished two of my tests already.

That's only because she's very close to me. I love her, in a sense that I'd do anything to keep her safe. I've done that many times before. I want her to be happy, though I also find her crying and complaining annoying. Whenever she does cry i want to tell her to just shut up, I find it ugly, I find it irritating. It's a very annoying sound. I still comfort her because she's my mother, it's my duty to be there for her. If i don't she'll be distraught enough to kill herself.I can't feel the sadness she does but I know she's sad, I know she's suffering and I know I'll lose her if i didn't do anything to comfort her.

1c7n1so;Scared to take antipsychotics ;That_Text_3511;"Within the last month and a half I have been going through an extreme depressive episode after being probably the most confident and ""comfortable"" I've ever been with myself. I went to the doctor's for a certain type of thought and was on the verge of admitting myself to the E.R. Now that I feel more ""stable"" (but still pretty much exactly the same) he wants to try an antipsychotic called ""Abilify"". This is because I tried Zoloft in the past and ended up staying up for four and a half days, and began hallucinating (long story and I don't know why that happened).I am frankly scared to take any psychiatric drugs, especially antipsychotics (I understand the name can be deceiving). I am worried it will irrevisbly change my personality and thinking, and I won't have the self awareness due to the drug to realize what is going on. I also refrain from looking up people's experiences about antipsychotics now since whenever I did in the past, and I'm not trying to be rude when I say this. But alot of it we're people who seemed deeply mentally disturbed, have this almost ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" esque attitude towards these drugs. Where it some big ""conspiracy"", and they are trying to ""Poison your mind"". Obviously I don't believe this, but it scared me how easy it was to find these anecdotal accounts (more than other drugs) and clinical studies about how it can affect impulse control. Overall I know I'm being irrational, I'm just scared.Thank you Hard to type since I'm on mobile, also when I said I had hallucinations I was always aware they were not real and it was more like visual distortions (tracer effects in vision, geometric patterns on surfaces, ect)";Within the last month and a half I have been going through an extreme depressive episode after being;Opinion / Thoughts;1;1;2024-04-19 03:34:34;2024-04-19;Friday;03:34:34;1681;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:18.209311

1c7mx61;feel so unloved - with good reason. It's been like this for decades. I'm so tired;Fun-Fix6487;"I had a run of serious bad luck. Lost my beautiful home which I owned in late middle age. Lost my partner same time. Took 10 years to find a new partner. 10 years alone with no stable home was worst of my life . No friends. All disappear when in trouble. Awful. Ended up having to move back in with parents, living out of a suitcase. My parents are on/off abusive & have been my whole life. They do amazing things for me then destroy me on a whim, like making me homeless out of the blue. It seems to go in cycles, like a rollercoaster- depending on their moods. Mum will scream at me & she never stops. Thankfully met someone & moved in together. Got married. Together 8 years, by that point partner's income was triple mine, but insisted we split everything 50%- fine. Partner refused to let us move to cheaper area even when my health & finances depended on it. Insisted on getting another job in expensive area I hate so I was stuck there.As soon as my finances / job took a turn for worse & my savings ran out, partner insisted I move out rather than wait for me to find a better paying job ""if you can't pay 50% rent you can't live with me"", I got kicked out (we're meant to be married!!).Back in with abusive parents again...Trying to get a job / income sorted & start my life again - only things available in UK are underpaid and require experience. No way I can hope to get a home again with that kind of pay. Need to find a way. Starting late on in life now. Parents won't let me work in peace or apply for jobs anywhere in the house. Yet they complain I don't have a job- while I'm begging to be allowed to sit down at table to apply for jobs. I have to sit in their car to get any quiet, but they don't like that either. Constant shouting & TV on maximum all the time. Noise reduction headphones & earplugs not enough. Not allowed to sleep until midnight when they sleep. Won't let me cook either, and won't feed me enough to survive. 600 calories is all I'm allowed per day- I eat when they eat, which is always 2 hours before bed time. We all have acid reflux. Anything over 600 calories, I have to eat sandwiches from shop or ice cream, as I'm not allowed to use the kitchen. I get ill while living with parents, from malnutrition & end up with damaged metabolism. If I talk about any of it, or say I'll cook my own food, I get screamed & shouted at.All I need is a bit of support & love just for once in my life. It's amazing how much a tiny amount of love will help. Grandparents were poor but loved their kids- would never turn them away. That's all I needed. I feel so lonely. It's hard to go from earning a lot to nothing at a late age.I'd settle for just average UK salary as long as I can save for pension & home & have some hope. I need hope.While at a job interview I received a text from them ""don't come home""- another rollercoaster from parents. I had to abandon all my stuff in my bedroom as they wouldn't let me come back. Homeless at train station. It's inexplicable. No arguments. Then I got a text justifying it with ""you disrespect your mother.... you must apologise for shouting at her..."". Needless to say I had not shouted at all. She shouted at me & I walked away quietly, it's been going on a while. I apologised anyway. ""I apologise"", I said. ""ok but you still can't come home"". My NHS PTSD therapist disqualified me for therapy on the basis of those texts- apparently I don't have a reliable loving home, she said. Great. So will NHS help me get one then? Any spare families available? No? Thanks.I'm too old for this- I should have kids & a stable home. Not have lost it all & back relying on abusive parents.I'm starting to think my partner is also with me for UK residency. It's the only explanation. What kind of married partner doesn't want you living with them? No idea how to report.Everyone wants to be around me when I have money, suddenly everyone disappears when I'm in trouble.Somehow my partners are always lacking in empathy, and my friends. Even extended family aren't empathetic. I feel so alone in a horrible world. Extended family all ignore me totally. If I reach out for help with my clearly abusive parents, all I get back is a text message either defending them or about handing myself over to God & apologising for my sins.I feel so alone. I wish I felt the same lack of empathy they all feel. How did it skip my genes. I couldn't do to any of them what they all do to me. It's almost like they see my empathy & view it as weakness. I've noticed when people perceive weakness, they all pile on. I look & sound weak. Could this be why??? Tried gym, I never seem to get big. Living in cheaper areas I can afford was always dangerous for me- I get targetted. Only in the safest & poshest neighbourhoods that I can't afford do people leave me alone & let me walk to the bus stop or get on with life. I was lucky enough to live in a posh area for a year. It was heaven. For first time in my life I felt free, not anxious, and wasn't attacked once outside- could hold my head high & walk down street without being shouted at names or harassed. Lots of people looked like me in that posh area. How did they all get their money?!! I don't care about the postcode, just about being able to live safely like everyone takes for granted. Happy to live in a shoe box there if I could afford that !!I think my weak disposition might also be why I'm bullied by family. It makes sense in psychology- when you live my life you become into psychology to understand why people keep treating you the same way.While in the posh area my health improved DRAMATICALLY. Wow it was like night & day. But it all had to end- temporary accommodation I was in, increased in price to market value.Why is it I get bullied by people so much? Why does it get worse in cheap areas & so much better in posh areas? I look & sound weak. This doesn't help. Tried gym, I never seem to get big. Living in cheaper areas I get targetted almost daily. Only in the safest & poshest neighbourhoods that I can't afford do people leave me alone & let me walk to the bus stop or get on with life. They're actually friendly to me. It's so nice to be treated like everyone else for once. I think my weak disposition might explain this since posh areas are full of weak looking men like me - thin & small boned? I dunno. I'm told I look ""beaujois"" or however you spell it & they seem to like me in posh areas. This weak appearance also explains be why I'm bullied by family & pretty much everywhere else. It makes sense in psychology- when you live my life you have to become interested in psychology to understand why people keep treating you badly.I've learnt never to tell any family or friends about problems with people- why? They first offer no empathy and second see it as an opportunity to do the same to me, or to justify their bullying. Unless I have money. If I have money then they all agree with me no matter what I say. It's bizarre.You start questioning yourself when everyone around you treats you the same. It must be something wrong with you. You're the only common denominator. Yet you can't put your finger on it no matter how hard you try to blame yourself. What did I do? Please God tell me what I did wrong.You end up believing humans just don't love you in general. No one wants you around.I already love myself, so sayings like ""you need to learn to love yourself before others can love you"" - doesn't work. I take care of myself & do my best in all. Fitness, health, diet, mind, I'm responsible. I still am happiest when I have people around me, to care about. I spent 6 months alone (not a single person texted or called). It was so debilitaing I used to go to shops and practically beg a checkout person to talk to me- they refused every time, grunting & refusing to respond to anything. It made me realise we didn't evolve to live alone- like most mammals. Lions, monkeys & dolphins live in packs, families & pods, just as we always did. Our brains are wired that way through eons of evolution. When alone for extended periods of time you physically hurt.After all, what's the point to life? To love someone & be loved. Self-love can't replace this.To have kids & family, whether biological, adopted, or friendships. To be together at Christmas & Easter. To have someone to come home to. Conversation. Laughter. Empathy. That's the point... yet it's so far from me.I have a small amount of savings left. Enough to buy a used car or rent a student room for a year in a super cheap university town. I've started again & again in life more times than I can remember. Wondering whether to spend it on a tent & helium instead.";I had a run of serious bad luck.

1c7msgx;A bad slip put resulted in yet another stay in at the cuckoo's nest and a Bipolar 1 diagnosis;lectriceye21;"I've had such a long history of substance abuse, it's difficult to distinguish 'episodes' between mental illness and post-acute withdrawal. Over the years, I've seen several therapists, all of which admitted I displayed manic-depressive tendencies; more rapid cycling mania than depression actually. After an ADHD diagnosis a couple years back, I got prescribed meds for that which helped with concentration, but certainly not my emotional dysfunction and mood swings. I have boundless energy and operate by making impulsively reckless decisions, so ADHD seemed to be the most fitting diagnosis from most doctors because my depressive phases aren't as extreme, and more situational-based. I've been clean for awhile, but this weekend I fucked up and overdosed on a cocktail of shit that put me in the psych ward for a bit. Over the few days I was there, I had explosive outbursts in between crying spells, then happy-go-lucky, all the way back to pissed off.

1c7mpp7;Can mental illness manifest physically? (19f);Fun_Dentist_1995;This is gunna be long and confusing so sorry. But about a year ago, (was 18f at the time) I started to get super sick and lost about 35ibs in a month or two. My main symptoms were nausea, vomitting, and night sweats, like I had to change clothes AND SHEETS in the middle of the night and could wring them out SWEATING. I thought I was dying because my whole life I’ve sat at 125ish IBS and had gone down to 92ibs. I went to numerous doctors, a gastroenterologist, and a neurologist. I had numerous blood panels, an MRI, and was tested for a number of crazy rare conditions. Nothing came up. All the doctors just said it must be due to anxiety. I did feel anxious, and was so tired of going to doctors, so I just went with it. I felt crazy like, how can my body be making itself sick like this? And I’m not aware of it? Because I didn’t have a diagnosis, it was up to me to fix myself. I drank THREE bottles of pediasure a day until I could eat solid foods again and force fed myself back to a healthy-ish weight (about 115) once I was at a healthier weight, my symptoms became way more manageable and eventually kinda sorta went away, now it’s about a year later and I still deal with what I call “episodes” where the symptoms come back and I sweat and night and vomit profusely until it goes away again. I think my depression and anxiety must just manifest VERY physically because, I’ve been tested for so much shit and came out healthy as hell. I also do deal with health anxiety after all this and it’s hard to draw the line between what I think my body is trying to tell me, am I sick mentally or physically? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Also for a little setting: I have had a very traumatic past few years. My dad kicked me out after high school because he’s a junkie. And I’ve just been staying in airbnbs until the shelter can take me and I can save up enough to get an apartment. So I guess I’m sorta homeless. This has affected my mental health a lot because I live in Oregon and a lot of the other homeless people are scary. It’s also just hard after seeing all my friends go to college and I’m homeless.

I had plans to go away to school and that all vanished in the blink of an eye. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety during this time, however in the last 3 years I’ve forged a good exercise routine and diet which has helped bring things down to a manageable level for the most part. My anxiety and depression left me as little help to my siblings and since the pandemic and having a lot of time to think about my life I’ve began to feel overwhelming guilt for not being able to be the older brother they deserved during such a life altering event. I’ve been around, but again in my opinion I’ve been of little help to any of them. I don’t have any vices; I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I’m not struggling with substance abuse, but all I do is exist. I’ve worked a handful of jobs, none of which have lasted more than a year, some of which I really thought would lead to something. I graduated high school, started college, but it never felt right so I withdrew after about a year. As of right now I’m embarrassingly unemployed with no prospects and lucky enough to have an Aunt and Uncle who have been letting me stay with them. They are very understanding, but I’m rightly, albeit a decade late, beginning to feel restless like I’m tired of watching my life pass me by. The shame and guilt is enormous. I have no idea where to start. Compounded by the fact a couple of my younger siblings are beginning to start their own lives and a couple are still needing a lot of help. I feel I should be able to help support the ones in need which is adding to the my current anxiety/depression loop. I’m anxious because I want to help solve all these problems and make things better and then depressed because I realize I have nothing to offer and it would take a long time for me to get to a place to be of any use. Honestly sometimes it seems like there is nothing I can do and that my family members in need would be better off if I wasn’t here taking up resources that could be used to help them. I’m not sure what to do or where to start. If anyone does take the time to read this thank you, and please don’t judge me too harshly.

1c7maov;Struggling Horribly;JustARandomDude95;Lately, I've been struggling with my depression horribly. I'm constantly low energy and my suicidal ideation has been at the front of my thoughts more and more. I feel alone and without purpose. I'm trying so hard to overcome it, to keep positive, but I can't keep the drive. I've gotten to the point where I try to have what I call psuedo-manic episodes where I purposely try to drop my inhibitions and try to force myself into a high-energy/hyperactive state to try to avoid my depression. I've also have had a friend who had been acting suicidal lately and I've tried to be a good friend to them, to support them, but I feel like I've been failing them. I don't reach out to them as often as I feel I should and I don't know what to say even when I try to check up on them. I also feel incredibly alone, I don't feel comfortable telling any of my friends or family this because the ones I would normally feel safe talking to are struggling with some difficult situations themselves lately. My best friend, the person who has talked me down from suicide more than once, has been going through such a rough situation with her marriage and trying to keep herself afloat, and I can't bring myself to add to that burden. I've even searched for a counselor, but can't seem to find one that I could feel comfortable with, and I have treatment resistant major depressive disorder so medication often makes me feel worse. At this point, I honestly don't want to be alive and I don't know what to do anymore.

1c7m3ya;I Can’t Remember Being Happy;GAlexTouchedGrass;"I 18M don’t know how to express to others how I feel, I don’t think most guys do well with emotions, but I, in the most recent series of unfortunate events, I have to go through withdrawals because apparently everyone is out of the anti-depressant I need.     My parents had me when they were too young, all I remember of being young is being hit and crying while locked in rooms, by the time I was 8 I realized the way I was living was not how people normally lived, I think that’s when the depression really started, when everything began to come into perspective to myself. My mom is bipolar and probably a sociopath, grandparents were weird on her side, they weren’t bad to me but I think my mom is the way she is because of how they treated her. As for my father by the time I was 3 he was essentially out of the picture for 9-10 months of the year. Had a late growth spurt (16-17ish) and was bullied for my size basically up until that point. Years of being beaten, some of the most brutal being used as a bowling ball down a driveway into trash cans (chipped my tooth, luckily not an adult), and being beaten with metal poles (the ones that hold up a stereotypical backyard trampoline. All ambitions were crushed by my mom or stepdad (drill sergeant; figures) because they weren’t big enough, from Youtube, to Software Engineering, to Game Design, to fucking Cybersecurity, all because they wanted me to inherit my grandpas (mom side) construction company, or join the army. Grades were never good enough, if they’re weren’t A’s and B’s they had to be, if not all A’s they had to be, have all A’s? Well A-‘s don’t count, besides physically abuse throughout my childhood I also received disproportionate punishments, say I disobeyed one order, even if I did not disobey I just didn’t execute in a timely manner, I could be grounded for upwards of 3 months. From everything, I would lose power to my room on dozens of occasions, WiFi most certainly was nearly 50% of the time disabled, toys were donated away. We weren’t poor, possibly upper middle class, but no luxuries were allowed, take a shower for more than 5 minutes a bucket of ice would be dumped on your head. Naturally I attempted to reach out for help, but then my mom would make up lies, tell one sided stories about how awful other people were. She convinced me my father didn’t love me or want me, that my grandma was a pedophile, that she wasn’t the manipulator but actually everyone else was. I’d have lulled myself by now, but when school started (high school) I moved schools essentially at the start of the year and I discovered wrestling, hate it, think it looks stupid or what, but my team and my coach saved me, not that I didn’t still get bullied or hazed, but I always had 20-25 brothers or sisters who would step in front of a gun for me. When I took my chance to escape junior year and come live with my dad the only thing I regret is I left the only people who I ever felt like were my family. Shortly after leaving one of the only people I care about in this world, besides probably my dad, my aunt/nephews (moms side), and sisters killed himself, I was already depressed but for the last year it has been eating me alive every waking moment that I should have been the one to die and not him, we were the same me and him, always laughing the loudest, doing goofy shit to get others to chuckle, taking center stage for the dumbest reasons. I should’ve known he had the same problems I do, I never got to say goodbye because I left so quick I couldn’t even go to his funeral because in order to do so I would have to spend at least. 1.5 weeks with my mom, my dad said he wouldn’t take me otherwise.  The day he killed himself is coming up, and even though I’m free I feel lost and like I dug through rock bottom and found hell. I don’t even have the roadblock of the antidepressants anymore so I feel this all magnified. I don’t know if I want to kill myself but I want to die. Oh yeah I had a therapist, but a couple of months ago she tried to send me to IOP with the hint that it could lead to hospitalization. One of the things she told me that sticks with me is she told me that when I was talking to her it felt to her like a game of cat and mouse, like almost telling her about myself but then stopping thrilled me and all I got out of the therapy was self satisfaction. I think I do it subconsciously, but sometimes I think I’m just as manipulative as my mom and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. No one know this whole story, I can go deeper in details but  I don’t see the point this is already long enough.";I 18M don’t know how to express to others how I feel, I don’t think most guys do well with emotions,;Sadness / Grief;0;1;2024-04-19 02:44:42;2024-04-19;Friday;02:44:42;4602;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:17.003452

I've been struggling with mental health ever since I was 13 but it's never really been this bad. It's gotten to the point where I'm debating admitting myself to the psych ward. I've been going over the list of pros and cons to going but I have a lot of stuff I'm concerned about. Part of the issues with my mental health are extreme mood swings, sensory issues (mostly food) and just overall bad thoughts about myself. I have the issue of not being able to talk about what I'm going through with strangers unless I feel safe so I'm not sure if that would affect anything. Another thing I'm concerned with is I need safe foods in order to eat. I know that in the psych ward, not eating is a red flag but would they force a feeding tube if there are no safe foods? I also can't sleep or function without sound that I can control. I'm just worried that those main things would make my experience really bad.

1c7lkl3;Called 911 since girlfriend threatened suicide, now she asks me to get her out of hospital ASAP;jdcowboy03;Called 911 when she repeatedly threatened to harm/kill herself 24 hours ago. I’m on a trip overseas to deliver something very important to her but after a few days of research I realized I couldn’t deliver it the way she wanted. I told her and provided a different option but she got super upset and angry and repeatedly accused me of betraying her and lying to her. We ended up arguing over text back and forth for 8+ hours. After a few hours break, she came back and wrote a long text calling the day would be the last day for her and that she felt hopeless and wanted to end it all that day. I got paranoid and asked her not to do anything stupid, but other than giving me all kinds of new accusations, she repeatedly said she’s either gonna jump out of window or hang herself. Initially she asked me not to call 911 or she’d hate me forever, and as she grew more agitated she finally said “I’ll kill myself now. Call 911 now and let them deal with my dead body.” I was already reaching out to her local police department through international phone calls and finally pulled the trigger to ask their help when seeing her last text. The police arrived shortly and took her to a hospital for wellness check. This was not the first time I called 911. Five months ago we also had an argument during which she threatened to kill herself and burn down the building. After police arrived, she suddenly appeared super calm and was able to hold normal conversation with them, and later with the doctors/nurses at a hospital. So she was let go on the same day. Later we reconciled but if there was any new argument at all, she would repeatedly accused me of intentionally locking her up in the hospital on that day and said she would never forgive me. She said she was only feeling extremely frustrated and has no actual intention to kill herself. But how could I know?It’s a shame I had to do it again this time. And she just texted me the hospital is gonna keep her for one week this time and she accused me of taking revenge on her and blamed me for intentionally disrupting her life and work. That she was just frustrated again and wasn’t really gonna hurt herself either (but she indeed had history of hurting herself such as bumping her head into the side window of my car, using electric wire to hang herself in front of me etc). She then asked and begged me to get to the hospital and take her out as soon as possible despite I am currently on the other side of the earth…)..I didn’t say yes to her request immediately and she was upset and blocked me.What should I do? Should I call the doctor and ask them to reduce the days for her? I read some threads on similar stories and k tried to tell myself I did the right thing, but I just don’t know. Right now she blocked me and I am not sure what to expect in the next few days. I fear it’s possible she will start another fight again and/or really hurt herself after coming out of the hospital because I broke the promise of not calling 911 again. (She experienced some trauma from the family and doesn’t trust anyone and is super sensitive about people’s words and actions in general and has a tendency to negatively interpret anything).

1c7kye4;The Anxiety of Post Hacktivism;ManticThread;The truth about hacktivism.I have been sitting on this for too long, and I have to voice it. My mental health depends on it I think. I was an avid activist about 15 years ago and for a good solid 5 years I lived in the shadows in the realm of computer security. My day job is/was as a web engineer. (I will explain 'was') I certainly thought I was doing a public service and helping push transparency in our government. I had a romanticized view of it, and was very much unaware of the consequences. I also, at the time, was prescribed Adderall. I was prescribed by my GP.Eventually, the anxiety of what it entailed as a hacktivist on top of the anxiety come down that comes with Aderall, led me to drinking, and drinking, and more drinking. I became homeless in 2017 after constantly failing at my real job. I felt so alone, so embarrassed. I still do feel both these things. I have not been able to hold a job for a good 8 years and I am still in the progress of saving my career.The problem with being prescribed Aderall by a GP, is that I did not know about the anxiety come down. And I did not know to go speak to a psychiatrist about it. Hence the constant self medication. While homeless, I started pulling myself up. I found all of the public health programs, and got to see a psychiatrist for the first time. I am no longer homeless, but still hanging by a thread. I am currently interviewing, and I might have to move into a relatives shed if I do not get a job soon.After 15 years, I am just now starting to heal. I stopped drinking. I study what helps me further my career. And I am starting to allow myself to share. I have very few friends, but the ones I do have are great.My family only saw me as an alcoholic, and tried to force me into a rehab in the past. I knew alcohol was not the main problem, but a very serious symptom of the problem. I never told them about my past and they would never understand. It is harsh when your family has such a negative and harsh view of you. I can not say I blame them. I don't know. I just want the shame and pain to go away.I am just so sad about it. So upset. I feel like an idiot. I feel like an impostor. I feel alone. With all of that said, I am moving forward.Thanks for reading.;The truth about hacktivism.I have been sitting on this for too long, and I have to voice it.

In actuality, it's me hitting my screen with my mouse, or dropping my phone on the concrete.

1c7kkvr;Should I go to this party and risk an anxiety attack? ;gianna1289;I will try to keep this as short as possible but I rlly need some advice right now. I’m a freshman in high school and this year has been the worst year of my life. I’ve lost almost all my friends, had rumors spread about me, and had my reputation ruined. I developed extreme emotional dysregulatuon, friendship anxiety, and anxiety attacks that come frequently. To say the least I’m very traumatized and have trouble with basic daily interactions with a fear that I’ll have an anxiety attack. I’m in my schools choir and musical theater program, so when I fell out with my normal friendgroup, I got very close to my theater friends and felt like I finally met people who cared about me and made me happy.Towards the end of the musical I started telling really left out and saw certain people becoming distant towards me. My mental health plummeted even more and I ended up crying and feeling left out at every rehersal. It was so hard for me because the people who helped me with so much with my old friends acted like they didn’t wanna talk to me anymore. After awhile, I could tell some people started not liking me at all and they removed me from their private stories and started ignoring me all together. This obviously made my mental health worse.On Tuesday night, my school had its annual talent night which I sang at and all my old friends showed up and sat front row. One of them wished me good luck over text and I took it the wrong way as they trying to make fun of me but they were not.I ended up crying and sitting with my parents the rest of the show. I told them about how I feel like I’ve lost all my friends here and how none of them wanna talk to me anymore and how it hurts so much. It seems like after awhile everyone looses interest in me and I don’t know why I’m such a bad person according to them. I have so much anxiety simply going up to any of them because I have a fear none of them will want to talk to me. Tomorrow night there is a choir and theater party that’s being hosted and everyone’s going. If I go, I could fix things and have a good time but there’s also a big big risk of something triggering me and me having an anxiety attack which will make people dislike me even more. I really need some advice on how to handle social situations if I go and whether I should go or not;I will try to keep this as short as possible but I rlly need some advice right now.

1c7khfv;Schizo induced religion? ;Then_Recording_8947;I was raised catholic but an event that occurred when I was around 9 or 10 made me stop believing. Recently, however, I think only a couple months ago, I have begun believing again. And even praying for help. However it’s not the christian/catholic god I believe in. I don’t know what I believe in but I believe in something. And I believe in my heart that this god knows and loves me and helps me. I know this sounds really weird but it’s what I truly believe but I don’t know where this spirituality came from. I have my suspicions it may have come from a mental break or maybe when I was a heavy drug user only around a year ago but back then I was not spiritual. I was having religious delusions but I was not religiousAnd I don’t think I’ve “found god” or anything because again this is not the christian or catholic god and although I take some things from the bible and church to heart it’s not what I believe in and am trying to follow.  I don’t know how to explain it. Maybe its my brain trying to excuse my actions by telling me that this entity loves me even though I’m wrong.

We have had a few couple arguments (like 2 or 3) and we’re always able to calm the situation down in the same setting. The sexually intimacy is SUPERB and we still haven’t slept with one another so I know it’s going to be better if we do. Me and him are also both very big on communication it’s just he doesn’t like texting so we rarely have text messages but 1hr+ long phone calls. (& Just so you can get an idea of why I am typing this we went 17 hours without talking and I called him after the fact because I couldn’t wait) I express the fact I really like him and he does the same. We talk about our plans for the future (the ones we’ve been having since before we got with one another) but one that I haven’t told him was that there could be a future without him because I feel like once he actually does get the chance to see what I feel like on the inside then it’ll be like “mission-accomplished” or he might just keep juicing me and kick me to the curb.. in other words PLAY WITH ME. And so so far he hasn’t, he’s been more than patient and can sometimes tell by the way I act that I have definitely been in unfortunate situations and says I have nothing to worry about. He takes me out on dates, I’ve never paid for anything even though I offered to and usually I have this thing where I feel like if I express too much and “do too much” it makes me start to second guess a lot of things and run away from something even if I truly didnt and I’ve been having this feeling of needing to distance myself from him because I truly don’t want to get hurt because what are the odds of me actually being in love and that being a mutual feeling?;I recently just started dating this guy (we’re both under the age of 25 don’t know if that helps lol;Need Support;2;1;2024-04-19 00:58:26;2024-04-19;Friday;00:58:26;1875;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:18.233837

This usually happens mostly when I am feeling anxious or stressed. I have been doing this my entire life as far back as I can remember. My parents never acknowledged it, though I'm sure other adults pointed it out. I was bullied because of this and even friends and family would poke fun and ask why I did it, but I never knew why. Do to so much ridicule over the years and as I got older I tried my best not to do this, however it still happens. I have read about palilalia, though whenever I read about it, it's often referring to children that will ""grow out of it."" Clearly as middle aged woman that continues to do this, I have a hard time understanding at what point I'll ""out grow it."" I am a fairly anxious person, I don't do well socially and I am very awkward to speak too especially upon initially meetings, I often put people off during first impressions as I come across as silly, hyper, overly agreeable or very uncomfortable. And with social media opening my understanding of different neurodivergent types, I've started to wonder if perhaps I may have autism or adhd. My parents do not believe in such things, and therefore there was never a reason to address any of my idiosyncrasies, and as such nothing ""to treat.""

I struggle to find meaning in anything I do; it all seems pointless, and I feel completely lost.To share a bit about my background, I haven't had many friends. I was consistently bullied in school for various reasons, despite always fighting back. The bullying never stoped. I'm amazed at how I managed to cope during those times, which began when I switched schools and lasted for 8 years. As a result, I became a rather distant  person who rarely shows emotions, speaks few words  as a defense mechanism.In addition to my personal issues, my family faced financial struggles because they were politically persecuted, which only resolved when I turned 20After finishing school, I attended university, where I met my ex-girlfriend. We were together for four years, but she was unfaithful  and cheated next day when I moved from one country to another, which was devastating for me, especially in the early, challenging months in a new country.Even though I put a fake smile and everyone thinks I'm living the dream, I'm actually falling apart inside.Now, as I'm wrapping up my master's, I've started job hunting.

1c7gtr2;It's now been 4 years since I suddenly developed an inability to function that almost nothing has helped with...;Arteshi;"In March of 2020 I suddenly developed a new mental health condition. I'm unsure if it's related to the covid outbreak or not... but it's been four entire years and no doctor has been able to help with it in the slightest. I'm so sick of being unable to function or live my life because of this.Starting around March/April of 2020 I developed a condition where, without warning, I will suddenly feel an intense feeling of anxiety/dread for seemingly no reason. There's no thought that goes through my head. There's nothing I'm worried about.I could be having the time of my life, watching a movie, spending time with loved ones... it doesn't matter. It will come suddenly and it's usually strong enough that I can't think clearly or focus on anything other than the intense sense of dread that fills me. It feels like my chest gets really tight and my mind goes blank except for pure panic. I always relate it to the ""flight"" part of a fight or flight response, yet there's nothing to flee from.I was seeing doctors for depression and anxiety beforehand so I was quickly able to relay the problem to them... but despite trying just about every antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and anti-psychotic medicine available I'm still unable to function most days. for 4 years. I've really had enough.There's only 3 things that seem to help and all of them are infeasible for different reasons. ADHD meds help, though I'm not sure why, but they're far too controlled and generally unavailable to rely on. Not to mention they only work for about 6 hours at most. Weed helps, but it's far too expensive to get. And the only non-medication method that has worked all this time is laying down on my chest. It seems to help keep the edge off of the awful feeling of tightness in my chest long enough for me to get my bearings back, but it comes back as soon as I move out of this position.I don't know what to do.

1c7gj3y;I found the one but keep getting anxiety;Inside-Stress7517;"Buckle up. I talk a lot and I have a lot to say. I’m 25F and my bf is 24M. We just passed 9 months together but have been trying for a baby since February and talked about marriage even before that, I’ve had my ring picked out for at least 3 months. He is every single thing I’d want in a person and we are extremely similar people. The problem is I keep getting anxiety about him, or I think it’s about him idek. For background: my parents weren’t even together when I was made/born, my dad remarried but that didn’t workout bc she cheated on him several times, and my mom moved to New York in like 2009 to be with a woman who had two kids of her own. Brief summary of my upbringing- Basically I never felt wanted by my mother, who you could barely even call a mother, but fast forward to me being 25 and not really wanting her in my life because of all her life choices but being unable to tell her how I feel bc I don’t want to hurt her like she did me. Always lived with my dad who was a decent parent, definitely the better option, but has his fair share of mental health issues, almost all of which I have as well, including anger issues (thanks dad.). Now about me, I’ve always been super smart, should’ve skipped 2 grades smart, put very minimal effort but got straight A’s smart. College comes around and I’m still smart but coming off of HS which I ended with some hardcore senoritis and laziness. I didn’t have much motivation to go to class, especially if they were early, and am also a procrastinator. I majored in math but wasn’t your Uber technical math nerd, I was just good at it and knew I could make alot of money. After several years of skipping a lot of classes and not being technical with math I got decently behind, which led me to being stressed and depressed and surprise more behind. I dropped out after being in school from 2017-2022 because I had covid AGAIN but this time for 2+ months straight of endless coughing so I couldn’t focus in class and it wasn’t fair to the others. I want to finish my degree but don’t feel like doing the homework, and I can’t even go anywhere until I pay back $4000 that was financial aid that I had to return from dropping out. Another problem is I’m horrible with money. I grew up poor and had some depression issues and other teen problems as well so now as an adult whenever I have money I just want to buy things for that little dose of happiness. I’ve also only ever been in shitty relationships with men that seemed good only to be really good at lying. Outside of actual relationships I have a body count much higher than I want because I mostly got attention from guys because they wanted sex but I was just happy to have attention. Back to the focus of this post. I match with my boyfriend on hinge, it was like 1 am I was alone in my apt doing laundry and my phone pops up with him. He doesn’t take very good pictures of himself so his looks made me question it at first but his profile made him seem to be just the guy I wanted so I said let’s try it. We started talking and playing games together online and then a few days later had a date. It was such a good date. He also looked so much better in person than his pictures, they did not do him justice. My face hurt from smiling and afterwards he came back to my place and we played card games and just chatted about anything and everything and it was amazing. Even my cats all liked him. He was very respectful too, didn’t make any sexual moves until I brought it up on I think our 4th date? It was a night he stayed over. And it was so good. I’d say another week or so went by, this would’ve been the start of week 4 of talking. We’re chilling like normal and playing bo2 zombies and the game wasn’t going very well but for some reason my mood just switched like a light. (It has always done that, my mood can go really high to really low and back and forth within minutes.) my mood switched and suddenly I was super down and we just decided to go to bed. He laid down and then I did but for some reason I suddenly had massive anxiety and felt super sick, a feeling I had only had once before a couple years prior when my mom came to stay with me after I had a surgery. I felt sick for days and had such horrible anxiety trying to figure out why I felt that way suddenly when I knew I liked him and he had every quality I wanted in a man. My brain was telling me I just couldn’t be with him, but then the thought of just being friends or losing him quite literally made me want to die. He came over a couple times after that feeling started and we tried to talk and he was asking for a reason why I felt that way and I genuinely couldn’t think of one and when he went to leave I grabbed his hand bc I couldn’t let him go. That next morning I was supposed to open the store I was an assistant manager at but couldn’t because I had been up all night crying and freaking out trying to deal with the thoughts fighting in my head, which made me physically sick and honestly suicidal. So for once instead of just letting it get worse I went to the hospital. From there I learned of this place in town that was a mental health crisis center and I ended up staying there for 5 days. Cried myself to sleep, and was still constantly thinking about him. The day I left I was just so ready to leave that place because I was bored and the food kinda sucked. I asked him to come over and he agreed to and once I got close to my apartment where he was waiting in his car I suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of joy and excitement to see him again. He even brought me flowers and candy. Later that night he asked me to be his girlfriend and I was sooooo excited (I of course said yes). After that it was like my mental problems suddenly went away. But from my grippy sock vacay I lost my job and the next week had all of my utilities shut off in the middle of July. I asked to stay with him for a bit until I somehow got money to get them back on but I ended up just moving in with him after about 1-2 weeks of being there and us both deciding that we didn’t want to spend a day apart. Everything was great, it was perfect all the time for months. We eventually moved into our own apt, I moved in with him and his roommate and their 2 cats, bringing my 3 made 5 total cats and 3 people in a not very big or nice place. After being in our own place for a few weeks my anxiety was back. I’ve always been a bit chunky so we did a workout together and we pushed too hard on my body and I got sick, which made me miss work the next day which gave me anxiety and made me sick again and on the third day of all my stress and anxiety putting stuff into my mind I told him I thought I was losing feelings for him. Things got really bad again and after being up all night crying I was ready to end it all and opened up my wellbutrin xl and had a bunch in my hand but decided I should wake him up so he can help me stop that. I still didn’t feel better the next day and ended up going back to the center I was in at the beginning. This time only for 2 nights where he visited me daily and I ended up going back home with him on the third evening, despite still feeling really anxious about it. I was happy for about an hour max, and then I was back in the truck crying wanting to go back to that place. I almost did, he even drove me all the way back where we sortve had an argument in his truck which ultimately led me to the decision to try and be strong and fight it outside the center so we went home. For the next 5 ish days I would feel good for a while and happy in love again and then shortly after my anxiety would come back. It’s not just normal anxiety that the general person feels over general life stuff, it’s vomiting and sweating and feeling sick but being unable to eat, neverending racing thoughts and even panic attacks. After the first time at the center I was put on ability, I had previously tried Zoloft but didn’t want to lose my sexual desires while in a relationship, ability made my whole body weak and tired for weeks so I switched to Wellbutrin. After the second time at the center I was taking Wellbutrin AND Zoloft. I was still throwing up all the time but I wasn’t sure if it was the medicines fault or my anxieties fault, but being sick gives me anxiety and having anxiety makes me sick so I couldn’t win, but I did typically feel better after throwing up. I eventually switched to lexapro after deciding the Wellbutrin Zoloft combo wasn’t working. The lexapro combined with therapy weekly was doing great. I managed to overcome my anxiety, or so I thought, and was fine by Christmas and even for months after. About 4 or 5 weeks ago my job suddenly told us they were closing that location, me not having much experience or my degree yet made me super stressed about finding something else. Any employee not kept on was offered 3 months regular pay rate severance pay in the form of regular paychecks if we agreed to stay and work there until the location closed. At first I said hell yeah I’ll do that, I’d be getting a 3 month paid vacation that no other job or time in my life I’d ever get again. But that joy didn’t last long and I got stressed so I started applying to places, per my bf and therapists suggestion, and eventually found a job. It was a commission only sales job but I was willing to take the risk, that risk lasted for 1 week and I quit. I found out after 5 days that Saturdays were mandatory and that’s after spending each week out in the “field” walking for up to 8 hours going door to door with no lunch breaks and RARE bathroom breaks because I was at the mercy of my trainer and the team lead being the one to drive us all to the location so o couldn’t go anywhere or home for the day until she did. So a 6 day workweek, working 10-12 hours, always walking just wasn’t cutting it for me; my body can’t handle that. I’m almost at the end of my second week of having mo job and no money and have gotten extremely bored therefore extremely depressed and therefore anxious again. It hasn’t gotten as bad as it was before but I’m scared it’s going to get there again because I can’t seem to pull my mood up since I’m depressed and when I’m depressed I enjoy NOTHING and lose feelings towards everything. I think I had a normal mood swing for me which started my first episode, and because I would normally handle my depression alone but this time my now boyfriend was with me that gave me anxiety and it latched onto him so now everytime I feel anxiety it makes me question my feelings for him, him being the man I know deep down I love and want to marry and is everything I could ask for in a partner and will be an amazing father when that happens. My depression caused joylessness makes me not want to do anything sexual or loving and that makes me question my feelings and attraction to someone I greet by calling handsome everytime he comes home or wakes up from a nap, and who is very good in bed. I KNOW there is a deep emotional love as well because he is typically the only one who can make me feel better and brings me so much happiness. The really hard part is I’m both very logical and very creative so when the thinking side and emotional side of my brain get all mixed up I can’t tell which side is right, the side telling me I don’t love him/don’t wanna be with him/isn’t attracted to him or the side that says all of those thoughts are made up delusions my brain is putting into my head just to try and hurt me so I can go back to that bad place because it’s easier to be depressed than it is happy. I tell myself it’s the second option, and that I will always fight for my relationship no matter how hard it is to beat my mind but it gets harder to maintain that when my anxiety keeps coming back. This anxiety is never anything I ever felt in a relationship before, especially because none of them were really even good and I knew that, but now I’m in the best relationship of my life and genuinely see an entire life with my boyfriend but I can’t seem to accept that for more than a few months at a time. I’m just begging for some sortve definitive answer so I can get my mind to stop and have it stay that way, because this is torture for me and him because we’re very open and honest so he knows I’m feeling this way and that makes me feel so horrible but I can’t seem to understand why or control it and make it stop.  SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! It’s driving me crazy. I saw a lot of similar stories about anxiety/depression making a person question their relationship, and posts about ROCD which I think I may have too, and those people said it gets better slowly with time but it seems like everytime I do get better I end up getting worse again and I cannot spend the rest of my life feeling this anxiety every few months. If anyone that sees this has felt similar please tell me.  How do you “beat” your own mind FOR GOOD?";Buckle up. I talk a lot and I have a lot to say. I’m 25F and my bf is 24M.

1c7ghki;My partner doesn’t text me during the days and it’s become repetitive. Am I being needy?;utepil;I’m F and my partner has struggled a lot with communication. For some background, she has Bipolar Disorder, BPD and Aspeger’s, which I don’t mind. She is currently homeschooled since the time she transferred out of my school. We usually get to see each other once a week (2 if I am lucky enough), so texting is our only way of communication. How about calling? She just doesn’t prefer it as it tends to get awkward for her, so I omitted it.I have full knowledge that she does love and care about me—she expresses this mostly when we hang out—but it often feels like I’m not needed. We used to say a goodnight and good morning daily, barely missing out on any like a ritual. It was comforting yet never mandatory, but it showed the effort that was put into this relationship. For the past few months she barely said goodnights nor good mornings. I always seem to initiate almost every single text. The only time she texts first is when she has to ask me something, not a “How was your day so far” or “What are you up to?” I need that interaction with her. If I were to calculate the overall time we’ve spent with each other, it would be 8hrs a week (5%) and that’s including communicating through messages. I don’t to overthink, but what do I even do other than wait for her to text? I’m awfully impatient. Talking to her about this issue won’t be very effective because I’ve asked her to check up on a bunch of times. It doesn’t help knowing that she is not talking to me when she is in need and resorts to video games as an escapism. I want to handle this situation without always being sensitive, clingy, and needy. I want to give her space but spend as much time with her without being a burden. Please help!;I’m F and my partner has struggled a lot with communication.

1c7gb5a;mental health anxiety ;Character-Job9602;hi all! so i definitely have some kind of health anxiety/hypochondria. I used to be very scared of having an unexpected heart attack and when I got over it,I started being very worried about my mental health. The scariest but also rarest mental illnesses is the only thing I can think about. Recently it’s been better but I sometimes feel like there’s no way out of it. Today I felt good,but suddenly started feeling very anxious (probably because of worrying over mental illnesses every single day for like 2 months now I think). And of course I then remembered that anxiety is one of symptoms of some serious mental illnesses. I’m so scared of suddenly developing one of them, I’m watching my thoughts all the time and make sure I don’t have any hallucinations and everything. I’ve had experiences that scared me like unexpected thoughts or just dumb and absurd thoughts that I considered delusions. I just don’t know how to finally understand that everything is okay and I don’t have any of the illnesses I’m scared of. Anything bad I experience or think about brings me back to being afraid of them. Can anyone who experienced something like this maybe tell me what helped them? (this post sounds very depressing haha I promise I’m okay,I have hobbies and try to occupy my mind but I’ve been anxious for some time now) (also I am afraid of randomly just getting them despite having basically no risk).

I’m in Europe.She told me that she hasn’t been so well since she started a new job 6 months ago. She knew she’s been having a huge stress under this new environment.One day, that was not long ago, she was working at home. Sometimes she can choose not to be at office.All the sudden she realized that she was crying for no reason. Theses tears just dropped off.She think that was a kind of panic attack and this is a beginning of depression. She can’t sleep at the night. Today she called me at 4 am in Japan time. Even she needs to wake up at least 9, she was tired but couldn’t fell asleep.I am not experts of a mental health. I have never had issues. I told her to go to see a doctor. Get professional helps and slow down on her work etc. I said all the typical advices.But she doesn’t have a time to do so. Please don’t judge her. She knows it’s ridiculous that she couldn’t make a time for her own health because she is busy for her work.But she is Japanese and her work environment is in very Japanese way.I just tried to listen to her today. I told her she can call me when she can’t sleep, lucky we have a time difference.I don’t want to tell her many times that she needs to see someone expert.

He is my FP. I trust him so much.. maybe too much. Anyway, of course I've grown feelings for him. I was drunk last night and we went to Denny's, I got more drunk and we got a motel. He's such a sweetheart, is always asking me for consent on things, he also does research on both mental health and addiction so he can be a better friend to me. Basically, we act like a couple but we are not. I mean I am in no condition to be in a relationship but at the same time I would love to be in one. We have been kissing and getting intimate with one another. Last night was filled of all of these things and then he started asking me to open up to him because he sees how much I hold back, so I did. I expressed my pain and basically cried in his arms. Then I had the genius idea of asking him about what his family thinks of me considering he tells them he's with me and what i'm going through with addictions and mental illness. So then tells me they don't judge me etc., then I address the elephant in the fucking room and ask if we will ever be something exclusive, I pretty much tell him I'm aware that i'm not the girl he would bring over for a family dinner and he pretty much agrees lmaoooo, basically let's me know we will never be anything serious because he cares about the image he holds with his family and that they would have shit to say but that he will be here for me in the mean time. I am a girl that is full of self harm scars and I also have piercings and tattoos. I wear a lot of black and I listen to heavy music. I am not the girl next door. I am not the girl you can bring home without questions asked. And to be frankly fucking honest, that made me feel like absolute shit. I brushed it off but now I can't get rid of the idea that he is just using me. We haven't had sex and I respect him for being the first man in my life who doesn't try to screw me right away. I feel bad to think he may be using me because he has been so selfless and has been taking care of me during this bender. My mom even trusts him. But he pretty much agreed that this will only ever be casual and ""platonic"". I fucking hate myself for falling for the guy knowing damn well I told him off the bat I wasn't ready for anything and only wanted to be friends.

1c7ewxj;I constantly feel hurt and angry and I don't know how to stop;Open-Spring-2652;About a year ago my wife left me to be with her ex-boyfriend. We were married, had a house together. She had two girls from a previous marriage that I loved like my own daughters. She was my first girlfriend, relationship, first everything. After she asked for a divorce, we lived together for another month before she moved out. She would go out many evenings to go be with her ex. Walked right by me without saying a word. It felt like my soul had been ripped from my body. I still very much loved her at the time, but she claimed that her feelings were too strong and she was tired of helping me deal with my issues.She started lying to me a lot. It made me question how honest she had been for the rest of our relationship. I felt incredibly betrayed. She had promised that she would always choose me. I trusted her completely. I'm no longer suicidal, but I briefly had ideations during that time.I don't think I can ever have a committed relationship again. How will I ever be able to believe someone when they tell me that I'm enough? What does a promise mean when it can be broken so easily and callously by the person you trusted the most? How do I have any assurance that a partner won't leave as soon as a better option comes along?The divorce was finalized earlier this month. It was non-contested, and I still supported her as much as I could during the initial separation. We were both in a rough spot financially, but me a bit less so, so I helped her a bit in the meantime. I didn't tell either of our families the real reason for the divorce. I didn't want bad blood between anyone.I don't know how to feel better. Every time I think about what happened, I'm filled with anger and hurt. I don't know how to look back and feel any sense of peace. It's ruining all potential happiness. I've tried to just forget it and not think about it, but that only works for so long. Eventually something will trigger a memory and my whole day is overcast by all my negative feelings. I'm tired of this. I want to move on from my past and have hope for my future, but I don't know how.;About a year ago my wife left me to be with her ex-boyfriend.

1c7egb3;How to process a near death experience.;Safeguardingfight;2 weeks ago I (32f) was rushed into hospital (my sister having to persuade me to go), struggling to breathe, heart was constantly racing, delirious to the point I couldn't get any words out that I wanted to, as white as a ghost, struggling to maintain my own body temperature and generally feeling unwell. I'd started struggling with my breathing a little several weeks before, but given I am overweight, I had presumed it was a combination of that and a cheat infection and so didn't seek medical help. Fast forward to the day I was rushed in, my health had dropped massively. I had some bloods taken within 10 minutes of being in A&E and they also did an ABG (blood gas test). I was wheeled back into the waiting room as is usual procedure (I'm in the UK, like many hospitals my local one is under immense pressure with a rapidly increasing population and little done to expand the infrastructure, so A & E has waiting times exeeding 5 hours just to get in minor and majors, over 20+ hours to get on to the wards unless its an extreme emergency) but had my name called within 15 minutes. The nurse rushed me into majors/resus and I was put on a blood transfusion. It turns out I was severely anaemic, with a hemoglobin level of 3.8g/ml, which I was later informed is life threatening level. I spent nearly a week in hospital, countless blood tests that left me covered from shoulder to fingers in bruises, 5 blood transfusions etc. At the time most of the staff didn't mention the severity of my condition, but given my previous job was as a health care assistant, I knew the amount of observations, tests and the fact the staff would pop in to just check on how I was feeling every hour, it was significant. Since returning home, I have had an appointment with my regular GP who has made me aware that it's shocking that I was even able to get into my own car to get to the hospital, the level I was at can cause organ failure and death. I was in abit of a bubble over it all, but it's slowly dawned on me had my sister not persuaded me, I likely wouldn't be here. I'm a mum of 2, one of my biggest fears for a long time has been the thought of leaving them without a mum (I have other health conditions that effect me day to day as it is). The reason for my post is to hopefully find others who have experienced similar, because my question is this, how did you mentally process everything you experienced? I'm finding it a little difficult, im becoming paranoid about making sure my skin isn't starting to go pale, im constantly aware of how my breathing is in case I start struggling again and I am so petrified of my levels dropping. I know I am lucky to have survived (thanks to my sister and the amazing NHS staff that cared for me is the reason that is the case) and I'm doing my best to try and keep positive thoughts, but I can't help but worry that I may not be fully out of the woods and that I could dip again...

1c7ed7o;My brain is always looking for something to be sad or stressed about and I hate it;TheSolarElite;It has become readily apparent to me over the past few months that I am not mentally well. I have been depressed at one other point in my life a few years back, but that was honestly nothing like what I’m experiencing now. Back then, my sadness and lack of energy could both be easily explained by the circumstances I was in. It was during covid, I was stuck at home, I was failing all my online high school classes, etc etc. Anyway, I got through it in the end and I think part of the reason is simply that I knew what the problem was and could work towards solving it.Right now though, it feels like my sadness, anxiety, stress, anger, lack of energy, and endless rumination are all coming from somewhere I can’t easily explain. Every morning I wake up sad and anxiety-filled and my brain immediately begins coming up with some “explanation” for it. Usually these “explanations” are complete bullshit and are clearly not the real reason I’m feeling the way I am. Yet, I can’t seem to control my thoughts and end up spending hours and hours ruminating about the “explanation” my brain has provided and how to solve that issue, when I clearly know the real issue is nothing like what my brain is telling me. A few days ago my brain decided my sadness was because of a sad tv-show ending I watched years ago, the next day it decided it was because of my parents stressing me out, the next day it was because of my lack of a romantic partner, and now it’s decided that my anxiety is caused by a fear of death far in the future.It feels like I have no true reason to feel the way that I do. I’m just automatically feeling like shit and my brain needs an explanation for it and my obsessive personality causes me to ruminate for hours about these explanations and issues, when the real issue is probably just a chemical imbalance in my brain.I tried to reach out today and finally get some therapy (something that I was very nervous about) at my community college, since our website states they provide a licensed therapist free of charge for students. I called the number provided on the website and tried the email as well, neither worked. I have no money for actual therapy anywhere else (assuming that my small town even has other good non-religious therapy options available anywhere) so I was really banking on this and now that it’s failed I feel even more trapped and hopeless than before. All my friends drifted away after high school and I literally don’t talk with anyone but my parents who I currently live with and don’t particularly get along with. I feel so fucking alone and working a part-time job and attending college while feeling like this is becoming more and more impossible for me.

1c7ea2b;I'm feeling so left out...;BerriesPi;"My friends were always the top of the class, smartest in my grade type of people and they always got good grades and thought anything lower than an 80 was a fail. Recently, in high school, my grades have been lowering and more and more I feel so disconnected and left out of my group because of that. While I'm getting 60s-70s and 80s with the rare 90+, they all have a grade average of 90+. Everytime they talk about their grades, I wish I could just run away and curl up by myself(it sounds dramatic ik but I'm not sure how else to describe it). It's like that scene in the Charlie Brown Halloween movie where they all announce the candy they got, ""96, 98, 99, 90, 87, 100!"" and then you see when they get to me I just say lowly that I got a rock.. ""80..."". They get so upset too, when they get a 99 or a 98 or smth like that because it's not deemed good but when I say my 80, they say ""good job!"" or ""it's a pass!"" it seems like they're patronising me because they know I can't do any better. I've tried and tried to prove then wrong but I get so exhausted and I find no matter what I do, I'm just not getting better. Moreover, I'm not the most outspoken or extroverted with my friends. Sure, I'm more comfortable and a bit more extroverted when I'm with them but I still feel so uneasy and nervous to jump into a conversation bc I feel like I'm unwanted. Another closer friend of mine is inba couple with another one of my friends so now it just feels awkward to be with them (also making me lonely but that's another thing). Often times, I feel like they won't even reach out to me. Ik it's a two-way thing but I find that I have to make the move quite a bit. I really want to tell someone about this, like a close friend, but I don't have any. Those friends are the only ones I have and while I love them all and care about them so very much, I'm so scared to talk to them about this in fear they won't care or will be annoyed or offended by me and stop being with me all together.Recently, I’ve felt like I’m growing more and more away from my best friends and it’s making me really go back into the su1c1d@l place I was a long time ago. I really don’t know what to do and I feel so trapped and alone. I don’t want to lose them since I really do love and treasure them but I feel like I’m just a burden and an incompetent, stupid person who they'd be happier without. I don't have anything special about me and I can't even be smart or be up to par with them in terms of grades...

I’ve never gone outside alone except with family or workers. Ive spent almost 4 months just laying in bed doing nothing. Im so lonely. I have no motivation to do my makeup and im so embarrassed even if i try. My anxiety is so high up im shaking when around family. I’ve been isolated this whole year and nobody is doing anything. Child services is finally trying to help me but they’re too slow and i’m too embarrassed to say anything. I’m having it so bad the only thing i get excited for at the day is getting hungry so i can eat food or going to sleep. the day goes so slow just doing nothing. i’m only talking to around 5 of my closest friends obviously they all have lives and can’t talk to me all day and i still feel so hurt. I have usually been stress eating but now even eating seems so boring. I feel so empty. Right now i’m at my fathers because i got sick from laying in bed all day so child services let me be at my dads so i at least would be able to walk around the house. Yes my anxiety is so bad when im at my foster care i just lay in my bed and i eat in it everything except when i go to the toilet. At their house i might even restrict myself only going to the toilet early in the morning or late at night when they’re asleep. I’ve been crying so much. I’ve been trying so hard to talk to people online to get some kind of comfort but laying in bed with greasy hair and no makeup makes me feel so insecure to the point where i dont wanna speak to anybody online even when they’re strangers. this week i got my ultrasound done and my kidneys were fine and the disappointment i had. I was hoping that i would have something wrong with my kidneys so that they would let me go outside again because im dying. I feel so lonely and disgusting and embarrassed.

1c7ds87;My mental health is so much worse every time I look inward;ConsciousNomad12;Not sure how to really explain it but I’m going to try my best. From a young age, I had been told by my narcissistic dad that I was “fat” even though I was no where near it. That hugely affected my self image and I lost a lot of confidence. I always have been relatively shy growing up. Had a rough childhood and my coping mechanism was escapism. I’d get lost in video games and it became a comfort and a passion. This means I was pretty reserved and always kept to myself for the most part and missed out on quite a bit especially in high school. Here’s were the issues start so to say. Throughout middle school and high school I was the “nice guy” who was always friendzoned. There was even a small stint where I went to therapy for it for self harm. Nothing ever came out from those couple sessions but the problem persisted. I haven’t had a lot of sexual partners and when I am in a relationship I’m always longing for more. I was never shown that attention from girls and for some reason I am constantly searching for that. I download dating apps and then delete them only to download them again AND then delete it again.I don’t want to be caught in this vicious cycle but I’m still craving some validation from the other sex and that’s not the way I want to live. I also believe this has led to a mild prn addiction because im just constantly looking for that intimacy.If this isn’t the right place, please point me in the right direction but im just looking for some outside support and perspective to put an end to these thoughts Thank you if you made it this far… really my first time ever putting it out there;Not sure how to really explain it but I’m going to try my best.

1c7dic0;There isn’t anything wrong with me;Infamous_Lobster21;I don’t want to do anything anymore not because I’m sad but because I just don’t. My mom gets emotional when she brings up my lack of effort, but does that mean much to me. And I don’t mean that in a 0 empathy, kind of way but in a this doesn’t matter way. Is there something wrong with me? Maybe I want to stay where I am forever or maybe I’m afraid of change? I keep asking myself these things and every time I realize I’m not. I’m not afraid of change in anyway. So I looked somewhere else to find a reason because there must be one out there, right? But when I tried I could never find the words to show how I felt. My thoughts were just that I was a teenager going through a faze, but why does mine have to feel like this? I don’t feel like I’m in my body anymore. Almost like I’m in 3rd person until I speak with someone, but I hate to speak with others. It’s like watching a movie of this person with the same name and face as you. That’s the only way to describe it but even that doesn’t feel like enough I feel like my whole body is itching to find out the meaning out whatever this “is”. When I was 15 I tried to take my own life by cutting myself in the bathroom tub. Obviously it didn’t work because I couldn’t cut deep enough, but it felt really strange to step out that bathroom after stopping the bleeding then being told to take out the trash. I think that’s where I stopped feeling like I was myself. I think I left some of myself on those tissues I used to clean. That day, I called the suicide hotline and tried to speak to someone. It was strange because I got it off my chest, but I still couldn’t tell my family. when I was in the hospital for a separate reason a doctor ask me some questions. She asked “have you ever thought about dying ever” and I paused then told her no. Truth is I think about dying everyday, but I can’t because I have people around me who care. I’ve never been the type to speak about my feelings. I feel selfish. Like “who do I think I am”there are people who have it far worse than me, so what’s my reason? But there is this other side of me that wants to be selfish and say “but everyone has their own struggles” but that brings up the question, what struggle have I gone through? I’m just a teenage boy like all others who is lost and trying to find my place but knowing that doesn’t help my feelings know that others are going through worse doesn’t matter to me because I can’t even care about myself. I read around and it’s always the same thing “you’re young” or “you have time”  but Im young and don’t know how to use my time. I guess it just feels weird to be alive. I’ve become so self conscious of myself that I started to ignore others for the off chance they don’t like me. Another thing that doesn’t help is the constant moving. I’m moving nearly every year sometimes two so it’s always hard to find an adult I’m comfortable with and all my close friends are now just online friends. Maybe there is a part of me that doesn’t want to die and maybe if I just got up and did something things would change but I don’t want to. I don’t want to put in any sweat, effort, or tears and I’m fine with that.If you read all this im probably fine, just wanted to vent a little.

I love her but having been 6 years dealing with her bad mental health and seeing she doesn't want therapy or help besides my attention and keeps falling on the same points as she did when we started dating, pains me deeply. I love and care about her, but I don't know what to do about my own mental health. Should I leave her? She may hurt herself if I do. Am I even allowed to leave if she's a nice person and our relationship also has good moments?Gf and I have been in a relationship for 6 years, half of it she had an extremely bad mental health that would end up hurting me (mostly provoking me anxiety, but also provoking me some trauma I resolved years later -- like getting triggered everytime I heard my phone buzz during the night). Now she's a bit better, but after 6 years, she hasn't changed that much and still needs me by her side constantly for her well-being (if i'm not there physically, she gets very sad and anxious, which means I cannot have much life outside of meeting with her and doing whatever she wants to do that day -- which leads me to lose on activities I would like to do or delay my own needs).She needs me physically by her side and when I tell her that I won't be able to do so for a day, she gets really depressed and talks to me about how she's a burden for me (not with manipulative intention, I think she really believes that). It's been 6 years trying to convince her that her thoughts about being a burden are not real, that she is not a burden to me, I just happen to have stuff I need to do. She won't listen to me, won't accept therapy (I even started going myself because I wanted to know how to help her -- and vent) and I think she hasn't even tried any of the strategies I told her, at least no more than once or twice.I love her and care about her. We have great moments together. But, still, everytime she gets depressed about anything we have talked about millions of times before, I cannot help but feel preassure on my chest, sadness and frustration. It pains me. Sometimes I dream about we breaking up, staying on good terms but not having her relying so much on me for her well-being. I feel like an asshole for it. I want to help and I tried for the last 6 years, but it seems futile. Should I leave her for the sake of my own mental health? Should I try to hold on? She has previously stated she thought about killing herself if I got to leave her, as she thought she wouldn't have anyone else. Also, as I stated, we have lots of good moments together. Maybe I can hold onto that? Is it worth it?

For the first weeks of the trimester I thought I was doing well college-wise and mental health-wise, I was making progress in therapy, my medication was well adjusted,  and I seemed to be getting out of the shitty state I was in prior. However, with exams creeping up, I can’t help but start spiralling again. As I have high standards for myself and I’m a high achiever, there’s a lot on the line when it comes to exams and grades, and it puts a lot of pressure on me. It’s not about grades only, I just feel like if I don’t achieve high I’ll be nothing and I’ll lose a huge part of my identity. Despite these fears, I feel like I’ll flunk my exams this time, because I physically can’t handle it.

1c7cwsi;Bf refuses help for mental issues;Tall_Schedule8201;Hello. So about 2 months ago. My boyfriend started accusing me of cheating. I didn’t think anything of it but he started obsessing over it. Then one day he txt me saying god awakened him and he was the chosen one. That’s when everything took a turn for the worse. His cheating accusations got worse. He was having delusions about government watching us. He at one point said our kids had the devil inside of them and he was scared of the color black. He kept saying he felt someone inside of him and that god chose him to help others get rid of their demons. We ended up putting him in a mental hospital due to an incident where he grabbed me in front of the kids and started shaking me yelling for the devil to get out. He was out on meds. And the delusions seemed to have decreased. However, he started smoking a lot more weed and the pens. He became obsessed with wanting to be a millionaire. Says I bring no value to him. All he wants to do is he out spending money. If we don’t agree with him he goes into rage. He keeps saying he cares about his kids but doesn’t even spend time with them when they are at his moms house. He is currently living at his moms due to all of this. He believes he is going to retire at 30. Doesn’t want to help pay for bills even though he has his money invested. Refuses to take it out and tells me to borrow money from my parents. Idk what to do anymore. He no longer wants to take his meds. All he wants to do is smoke and calls us all annoying for wanting to help. It’s taking a toll on me;Hello. So about 2 months ago.

1c7bz4a;I am a terrible person and horrible employee because of my incompetence ;Agitated-Scratch4285;I’m in my first job out of college, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, probably depression and ADHD. I am the type of person to be easily defeated and sad and really struggle with rumination and negative thinking. That’s been how I was like since middle school and is still me to a certain extent. I did a four year degree that was a lot of work and stress and made me honestly miserable but I stuck it out because I didn’t know what else to do. I have never felt so dumb and anxious in my life than in college and my mental health only got worse. I somehow got a great job out of college and involves a lot of client interaction and technical work. It’s been around a year now and I’m struggling to retain/remember all the technical information and apply it and I struggle with communicating with clients too. I feel so bad because I have a mentor at work who is so patient and kind and helpful and I want to do right by them and do a good job but I feel like my reputation at this company is done for. I was late on deliverables, I’ve still not improved that much on my speaking and I’m struggling to remember the new information I’ve learned from training. It’s brought me down and made me sad but I have no one else to blame but myself. I’ve had conversations with my managers about my performance as well. I don’t know how long I can last at this job or if they will fire me but it has made my mental health terrible. I feel like a terrible person for wasting my mentors and managers time, for not improving as much as I should and making terrible mistakes. They are all trying to help me but my social anxiety, bad time management and anxiety of responsibility have all caught up to me and overwhelms me. I worry what everyone thinks of me and whether I should stick this job out or just start applying elsewhere since I feel like everyone is fed up with me. I really didn’t mean to be this way and I just want to apologize to everyone at work that I have disappointed with my work. I’ve probably added so much stress and extra work onto my mentor and he’s only been kind and understanding. I don’t deserve it. I hate being this shy and anxious about everything, why can’t I be normal with a brain that can understand things?? Maybe I should go for an easier job so I can figure my life out…;I’m in my first job out of college, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, probably depression and ADHD. ;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-18 19:21:22;2024-04-18;Thursday;19:21:22;2296;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:43.237988

I’m been spiraling quickly after getting out of cheating relationship and losing motivation to do anything else currently. The girl I started hanging out with treats me like an option and I know she does, but when I’m with her I pretend everything is ok and that it’s what I want. I’ve got almost zero outlets, don’t even like the things I used to like anymore. Don’t play games anymore unless I just really need the distraction. Feels like I’m going nuclear or something. I got a beach trip with friends planned in two weeks.The delta between where I was two weeks ago and now is insane really, even last week I was so happy and optimistic, and I felt like this but only late at night when nothing else was to be thought of. Now I wake up and immediately I’m just not wanting to even try to get up, I’m just thinking about that damn girl always when I know I’m probably not even on her mind for a minute unless I’m literally there in front of her. I was playing games with friends at the beginning of the month and hanging out with people daily. Now I sit in my house and only leave for work or to get the girl who I’m convinced is only here until the perfect man for her is. I’m off of almost every social media, I have Snapchat and Reddit, that’s it. I have nobody in my contacts besides coworkers and family and my two or three close friends. I’m fully isolated. I’m not ready to give up or anything I just don’t feel happy. I know there’s time for things to wrap up this chapter and things may get better but that’s just one potential option. Maybe I could get into some bad shit and I’ll feel better temporarily but then my life might get fucked up. Maybe I’ll cut everyone I do have left out of my life and become the world’s best hermit besides those tribes without modern technology. Who knows, but this is where I’m at right now, always tired, always about to breakdown, and always thinking.;Well I’m here, I got my choices in front of me, none of them are fun but maybe some of them will be ;Venting;0;1;2024-04-18 19:13:19;2024-04-18;Thursday;19:13:19;2009;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:17.037262

1c7bcu4;i want to get over my ex but i don’t know how to ;Defiant-Mail6338;i’m not over my ex but i want to be. so about a year ago and a couple months, my ex had cheated on me. he did so about 3 times. at that point in the relationship i was numb to it and careless about the relationship. i felt like i had put so much effort into it, just for my relationship of three years to go to waste. i had underlying anger, sadness, and bitterness. i had never confronted it on my own. i never had a “healing” phase. well i did for about two months but even then i kept going back to my ex so i never got to feel my own emotions. i never got to understand how upset, sad, and angry i was about it all. throughout that relationship i never felt completely happy or comfortable to be my own person. it felt as if i was trapped. they were suicidal and i felt obligated to stay there as they said they have cut themselves when we would argue. they got kicked out of the house because they were gay and i was the only support system for them. i remember that day so vividly. i had tried my absolute best to make it work but i just got cheated on. 3 times. i still stayed because they still had a grasp on trying to guilt trip me that it was my fault. THEY BLAMED ME ON WHY THEY CHEATED ON ME. i never got to heal from it. Towards the end of that relationship, i met this guy at work. it started with cute little stares, to accidentally touching, talking about our interests. i felt like i could by myself around him. like someone i’ve begged for so long. we went out for a month or two, all while my ex was begging to see me and to see what i was doing. at that point i was just angry at my ex and just wanted to ghost them. that’s what i did. i ghosted him. i always felt bad about ghosting as it was going against my own morals. i felt horrible and guilt for just leaving my ex behind as if we didn’t spent our teenage years together. however now i have this new partner. him and i are great but there was always something missing when i got home. i will still sad. i was still angry and bitter. unfortunately becaude i was selfish and didn’t want to accept the fact i was still mourning over my past relationships, i projected my underlying emotions to my new partner. i would constantly be angry, sad, bitter and annoyed. start arguments, wanting everything to be perfect in my own world. i became distant and neglectful towards my new partner. he got tired of trying to handle my emotions and told me there’s something wrong with that i need to fix. he was right, i was still mourning over my ex. i never confessed about it until literally 2 days ago. 8 months into this new relationship. i hate myself so much. this is the perfect partner i’ve always wanted. i always craved to know more about them. to learn their interest, to learn their weird sides, to learn their hobbies and how they grew up. i didn’t cone into this new relationship wanting a distraction. i came into this relationship because this person was such a light in my life and still is. However, they have grown tired of me and my sadness. they broke up with me. right now we are in a tough spot. i do not wish to break up. however i am guilty of lying to their faces about not being over my ex. about not knowing why i’m sad even if i knew why. lying if i still think about my ex. i hate that i just jumped into a new relationship out of anger. i hate that i just ghosted my ex without any explanation without closure for him and i. now i’m dealing with my consequences. i broke my new partners heart, my perfect partner that i dreamt of having is gone becaude i was too selfish to admit my own feelings. to tell him during my talking stage “hey maybe i’m not ready for a relationship right now” “maybe we can be friends until i find myself and have completely got over my ex.” Only recently like a month ago, have i noticed my feelings and memories of my ex have become distant. like they aren’t real anymore. i became more active in my life, in school, family, friends, and my partner. i was able to envision my future of graduating school, getting my degree, getting close with my family. in a way i was getting my own morals and values back. i was finally healing. most importantly, i was able to see a future with my partner. but it’s too late for that. it’s 8 months too late. he’s over me hurting him. i know it’s selfish to keep him with me while i still have these thoughts about my past relationship but i know i was getting better. i was healing while with him. but it’s too late. We are unsure how we will continue. i got therapy to help myself my emotions, i know i was getting better on my own but i knkw therapy will help me as i’ve been in therapy before. i love my partner so much and it just hurts i know i’m not a bad person. i just never gave myself time to process my emotions from my past relationship. i just hate that it may be too late. i just needed a place to resent. i’m sorry for a long story.;i’m not over my ex but i want to be. so about a year ago and a couple months, my ex had cheated on m;Content Warning: Addiction / Substance Abuse;0;1;2024-04-18 18:56:27;2024-04-18;Thursday;18:56:27;4909;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:17.042263

1c7b4tg;Debilitating rumination and anger. Unclear what to do. ;m0onrunner;Hello everyone. Forgive the long post. What i’m trying to describe is rather abstract, but I’m worried that it’s completely ruining my life.I had a friend in my life that I felt mistreated by. 3 or 4 years. When the friendship ended, I didn’t feel as though I said what I wanted to say. I felt like I had months, perhaps years worth of anger with no righteous conclusion and no justice.Sad and angry for a few months. Got over it. Life takes over and I do not think about it as much. About 11 months go by. The anger and rumination starts to come back. It comes in waves, but it starts to get stronger as time goes on. The fantasies, the made up scenarios, the running through talking points for arguments that never happened in 2019. It’s at the point where i’m just constantly thinking about my experiences with, and adjacent to this person. Letting the anger burn about things that happened up to half a decade ago. It’s fucked. It felt fucked even when I was ruminating on it for the initial few months, it’s been 2 and a half years give or take.I don’t even know who this person is anymore.Literally as I was typing this, I paused for about 5 minutes between these paragraphs having an imaginary confrontation with this person without even realizing it. They’re getting more brutal as time goes on. It seems to be some sort of protective mechanism by the mind. Prepping myself so I can avoid the humiliation and the hurt and the anger. Winning arguments ahead of time so that I have a means to defend myself, so I never have to feel so weak and small again. The switch for this mechanism appears to have snapped off.I did have a bad trigger back in December, so I suppose it sort of makes sense for the rumination to make a comeback. But the extent at which this is happening is fucked. It was fucked back then, and it’s fucked right now. I stopped feeling like a victim a long time ago (if I even was one in the first place, I have a hard time trusting my ego and my memory) I just feel pathetic.I worry my mind has created some sort of black hole in which to place all my rage. This person is but a memory at this point. An unreliable one at that. I worry that “i’m the baddie”, and that I have a borderline narcissistic mind that cannot cope with losing control. This person is just a basket in which to fill with my failure, and my frustration at my ineptitude in life.But I also worry that my mind is perfectly fine, everything was as bad as it seems and I am a victim. I worry that i’ve been programmed to feel in the wrong about my feelings and intuitions, despite being quite intelligent. There is a level of “ongoingness” to this whole thing. A rumour has been spread about me recently. I also had that “trigger” I mentioned before where I got pretty hurt by what somebody said about the servantile (on my part) nature of our friendship.All I know is that it’s interfering with my life and I don’t know what to do. I saw a psychiatrist and they thought I was fine. Any recommendations on a course of action would be much appreciated.;Hello everyone. Forgive the long post.

Anywhere between 200 and 700k per year, depending how hard I work, with room to make considerably more if I made the right moves. I have a partner. Dogs. Not much in the way of family apart from very immediate family who I love very much; my extended family disowned me once I got into adulthood which has caused a family rift, but it comes from me not being a full blood brother. Anyway, I’m just sick of living. I’ve had some great friends, but no one has stayed the course or shown me proper loyalty, long term. One in particular I went into business with for a few years, we were “competitors” and decided to work together and it was great. He kinda screwed me and in dissolving the partnership, I decided to end the friendship there. Was hard, I considered him as good as a brother, but over time I got over it.Since then, the connections I’ve had as a result of that former partnership, that I would’ve hoped were for life with some good friends have all but dissolved. Working for myself is extremely isolating. The last couple of years I’ve had so much in the way of excess funds set aside that I haven’t really had to work and I’ve been sort of in this isolated state that’s getting worse. I look after my partner financially. She makes a lot of financial problems for herself (and I) and I’m the one who comes and fixes it, but she treats me pretty horribly when it comes to finances. I won’t go into the full details beyond constantly pushing me to spend thousands on jewellery (Tiffany, Cartier, Rolex) along with our living costs, but I feel like an ATM machine quite often.Apart from that, I feel like me going backwards mentally is leaving her in a situation where she’s stuck with a failure or a human being. After feeling so isolated for so long, I almost feel institutionalised in a way. I do have a slight impairment (won’t go into it as I’m trying to stay anon) that makes socialising hard, however it’s an invisible disability and unless I told someone about it, they wouldn’t know. Whenever I meet people my awkwardness and social anxiety has grown and grown, gotten far worse as I’ve become older. I used to be outgoing and a funny, witty smartass, fine in groups, now I am pretty quiet. It’s not me. It’s not who I ever wanted to be. It’s not how a good person is. Whenever I make faux pas (and I make them more often now as I’m in my head 24/7) they seem to stay in my head and constantly crash over me in a wave of shame, over and over again. I used to be quite egotistical and confident in my looks, I think (well, thought) I’m a good looking guy (never had problems getting a gf, during my single phase I had great luck on tinder and in bars/clubs), but now I cringe whenever I see photos of myself and I’m reluctant to be in them. I don’t even know where I’m going with this, but the friends I thought I had, I would have literally put it all on the line for them and they’ve disappeared and because of that, along with my solo line of work, I’ve stopped putting myself out there and become really withdrawn. I guess if I’m being critical of myself, I must be the common thread with these failed friendships. I’m the common denominator. Family have cast me out, so called friends have left my life. It has to be to do with me.I can understand why someone would now, I’m not acting myself at all, but when all this started compounding I was still being relatively normal, so it confused me. It’s built up to a state of paranoia in my head along with crushing, relentless self reflection in the most negative ways possible. I hate myself. I don’t see a way out from here and I feel like I should go, rather than feeling like a reject for the next 50 years. I don’t know how, though. I’m not scared of physical pain, but I am scared of death to the point that it would be hard for me to end myself. I’m stuck in this self loathing limbo. I found online that helium might be a peaceful way to go to sleep. Dunno why I bothered writing this but yeah. Something triggered me this evening and I figured I had to vent somewhere. I don’t use a diary and I don’t post attention seeking shit on fb. I just find it strange that I’ve gone from being normal and reasonably successful to completely going backwards in the space of a few years. It doesn’t seem normal.

1c7b2e4;Negative thinking;marmar20022002;Hello Reddit, I just need some advice and words of encouragement I guess.I’m a 24 year old (f) and have lived a pretty privileged life. That’s not to say shit hasn’t happened to me, but I was lucky to grow up comfortably and also internationally (we moved around a lot growing up) due to my dad’s job. I’ve always been a sensitive person, a little more on the introverted side (I came out of my shell when I was 16). I also tend to think deeply about things, people, society etc, which I think has made me feel connected to people and be able to empathise with a lot of people. However, for the past couple years I’ve been struggling a lot with negative thinking. I feel like I always see the negative in everything. I’m always criticising things (the state of society, for example). My parents just moved to Dubai for work and when I visited them I just felt so miserable- I was judging people living there, I didn’t like how wealthy it felt etc. My mum pointed out to me that I always seem to have something to complain about, and sadly it’s true. What I wanna say is I just feel so trapped by my limiting, negative thought cycles. I feel stuck and I’m not growing as a person because I feel so hopeless for the future. I know I am loved by my friends and family, but more and more I just feel like I am tainted by negativity. It’s making me so sad. Sorry if I repeated myself a lot here, I just could do with some advice. Wishing you all happiness and fulfilment <3;Hello Reddit, I just need some advice and words of encouragement I guess.I’m a 24 year old (f) and h;Sadness / Grief;0;1;2024-04-18 18:44:56;2024-04-18;Thursday;18:44:56;1468;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:19.550699
1c7ays9;NEED ADVICE My girlfriend wants to end her life and I don't know what to do;Throwaway213985296;"# TLDR: My gf wants to end her life and I am unsure how to help herThe title sums it up. I am very lost and worried about my girlfriend. For a while now she has been mentioning how she does not want to live, and alluding to ending her life. She frequently mentions how she does not want to live to 20 (her 20th birthday is in a couple of months). She asks me questions such as ""would you be mad at me if I killed myself?"" or ""What will you do if  I was gone?"". She frequently says that she is ""dying"", and how she hates herself so much. In addition to these comments, she has been struggling with self harm for a while.  I feel that it has gotten especially bad recently. Events that would upset anyone else send her into pretty extreme self hatred, which is just so saddening because, she is just a phenomenal person, and very impressive in anything she does.## I have tried to helpI struggled with SH in the past, and made an attempt once, so to some extent I sympathize with her. I know that she does not like it when people talk about her scars, and tries very hard to cover them up. I try to respect that and do not bring them up or examine them intenionally with the one exception of helping her treat them. Although I am not a doctor, I am convinced that she has undiagnosed depression. I will not discuss her struggles here, but she exhibits behaviors which are in the DSM 5 definition of depression. For that reason I have really pushed her to seek professional help. She began to see someone via our college, however, it seems that the whole process is taking very long I know that it can take a long time to get appointments. Furthermore, they are social workers, and not registered psychologists, so every time she asks about treatment, she has to get referred to a medical proffesional. (Again, not  a psychiatrist) Both her and I believe that it would be good to get her medicated, however it has been months since she started therapy, and it seems as though there is no progress towards medication. (She has asked about being medicated). Medication helped me which is why I think that she should try it. ## Next Steps?I am worried because the comments are becoming more frequent and more explicit. I am really stuck. I have offered to pay for her to go to a registered psychologist, but she doesn't want to do that. I do not know how I can reach out or how to help her. Is there an obvious solution that I am missing here? Every time that something bad happens, and I dont hear from  her in a day or so, I get really worried. I feel as though I have been pretty passive because I never wanted to push something that she doesn't want or invade her privacy. I also want to be a place where she can go and not have to worry about it. When she is with me, it seems like she is the most joyfull person in the world. I am desperate for advice. I can't imagine losing her, and it would haunt me if I knew I could have done something. If you are reading this, just know I really love you, and you can always come to me, and I couldn't imagine my life without you -JMAlso, if a mod takes this down for some reason (I am not entirely sure if this is the right subreddit to post this), could you please direct me to another place where I can get advice.";# TLDR: My gf wants to end her life and I am unsure how to help herThe title sums it up.

1c7auv7;I(22F) have ASPD and ADHD and I uncontrollably treat everyone badly, and want to change.;Appropriate_Rip_5431;"This is long and basically my entire silly life till now, but ill start by saying I've never been a bad person. I've always had anger issues and a bit of an ""attitude"" since I was a child, (had a normal childhood but came from a one parent household and got zero attention/affection due to them busy with two jobs) but I've never been the confrontation type. When I was 15 I got diagnosed with adhd and recieved medication for it, they gave me the lowest mlg prescription at the time and I took them for a while but stopped due to not feeling different. As I got in my older teen years, I realized how lonely and depressed I was, yet I felt disgusted at the thought of having a relationship with one of my peers, at this point I'm like 18 and have never even kissed anyone. I was very quiet in highschool, I had acquaintances but only one real friend (whom I eventually cut off for my own ego reasons) and had opportunities to pursue romantic relationships but I generally saw myself as somewhat above of all the boys who attempted to pursue me in highschool, also I didn't really know HOW to have a relationship, and was really bad at speaking to men interested in me without feeling cringe. So I am now graduated and I am noticing I'm becoming more depressed and aggressive, I've always felt depressed from loneliness but it is now anger, I remember getting home from work and thought my sister ate my Tempura shrimp (she didn't I forgot where I put it in the fridge) I yelled at her for 5 minutes, threw my phone against her bedroom wall, breaking the screen and then proceeding to have a mental breakdown in front of her and cried curled up on her floor for 20 minutes. This was not the worse of my breakdowns, I won't mention all of them but basically I was getting mad at everyone for everything. So I go to my family doctor and get an appointment with a psychologist and am diagnosed with ASPD. At this point I'm 20 and finally getting into someone of my first ""relationship"", and despite my new diagnosis, I didn't feel it would effect me much, I thought of it as ""I grew up feeling alone so now I am anti social"" so blah blah turns out the relationship I thought I was In was a joke and my ""bf"" was In another relationship, and was using me for sex. Instead of me being a woman who values herself and removing myself from the situation, I proceeded to stalk and harass his girlfriend for almost a year (online) and berate her with insults in order to feel better about myself, my only explaintion on why I acted so disgusting is because at that time, that man was the first person to ever make me feel loved, and I didnt want him to leave me, even if he didn't really love me. That ""relationship"" lasted about 2 long years of me being used purely for sex, while I was constantly going thru mental hell with him, and being labeled as ""the crazy girl"" by his friends (he often would use my diagnosises againt me in arguments) I was contempt with it, until he eventually ghosted me. So I'm like 22 now, no friends, on dating apps, I go on some dates but narrow it down to the guy who I think looks best, who also spends the most money on our dates. Fast forward we're now in a committed relationship, baecations, really nice dates, practically living together, mind you, from the beginning Ive never felt connected to him mentally, i thought he was kinda dumb and corny, BUT I told my entire family about him and met his family, due to this being my first real taste of ""love"" I just was really excited even tho I knew it wasn't him that I was excited about, our relationship for the most part was good, but I did argue a lot with him, which he took really well. I eventually get in contact with my highschool friend and, while I am happy with my current boyfriend I am still lonely and crave more human interaction than just him. So I start going out to parties with my friend from highschool, I meet a lot of her friends, one of which is a guy, let's call him Joker, who immediately showed interest in me and I thought Joker was really funny in contrast to my boyfriend who was super laid back and serious, but I shrug it off because I'm not single, turns out I'm cheater because after like 3rd or 4th party with the same friend group, I cheated on my then current boyfriend with Joker. So at this point I'm faced with two options, be comfortable with current boyfriend or face the unknown with Joker, whom at the time I genuinely think I love?? Basically my dumb ass picks Joker, and I burn the bridge with my then current boyfriend. Joker now transitions almost immediately to my new boyfriend, but he loves me like, too much? Idk at this point I'm bored of typing this out ion think no one's gonna read this 😭😭 basically Joker tatted my name on him after like 2 weeks and then I realized immediately after I'm not at all attracted to him and I just was infatuated, probably purely on his fun energy, but even his personality is getting old to me now, It's like everything is a joke with him and it's so exhausting, everything he says makes me snap and we can't go one day without a pretty heated fight and I can tell I am draining him mentally, and don't even know why he's still with me, it's obvious I am no longer in the honey moon phase with him but since he's made it clear he wants to stay with me forever I can't bring myself end it even though I kinda hate him. Also I miss my ex 😕 idk why I wrote this. Oh yeah and I made Joker cut off his entire friend group because I had an issue with one of them.";This is long and basically my entire silly life till now, but ill start by saying I've never been a ;Venting;0;1;2024-04-18 18:36:37;2024-04-18;Thursday;18:36:37;5520;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:43.458827
1c7au7p;Lost Years to Treatment;Old-Squash-3379;I’ve struggled with my mental health my whole life, but it really reached a tipping point back in 2020 with the pandemic. I was a freshman in high school at the time. I was placed in a PHP, then to out of state residential, then to a horribly traumatizing tbs. I came back home for a few months, but I ended up back at residential. Overall, I spent my whole freshman and sophomore year in treatment as well as part of my junior year. I’m a senior in high school now, and I’ve recovered a lot, and I’ll be graduating soon. I’m excited for the next phase of my life, however, I still grieve a lot for those years of my life I lost to shitty treatment programs that did nothing but traumatize me, and I’m still in therapy trying to process and move on from the experience. I find it hard to relate to other people my age because I feel like I’ve missed out on having a “normal high school experience”, and I don’t want to trauma dump on them. In the long run, I know high school doesn’t matter, but it’s still such an isolating and lonely feeling right now.

1c7amcx;mental health anxiety;Character-Job9602;hi all! so i definitely have some kind of health anxiety/hypochondria. I used to be very scared of having an unexpected heart attack and when I got over it,I started being very worried about my mental health. The scariest but also rarest mental illnesses is the only thing I can think about. Recently it’s been better but I sometimes feel like there’s no way out of it. Today I felt good,but suddenly started feeling very anxious (probably because of worrying over mental illnesses every single day for like 2 months now I think). And of course I then remembered that anxiety is one of symptoms of some serious mental illnesses. I’m so scared of suddenly developing one of them, I’m watching my thoughts all the time and make sure I don’t have any hallucinations and everything. I’ve had experiences that scared me like unexpected thoughts or just dumb and absurd thoughts that I considered delusions. I just don’t know how to finally understand that everything is okay and I don’t have any of the illnesses I’m scared of. Anything bad I experience or think about brings me back to being afraid of them. Can anyone who experienced something like this maybe tell me what helped them?

1c7aj8m;College stress;Downbad_4_Altgirls;So recently college has had me feeling extremely stressed out and on the verge of a an anxiety attack. This is something that’s been building up over my last 3 years in college it started off fine even though going to college was very last minute for me and I chose a course I thought I’d enjoy being game development, which isn’t going as expected, meeting great new people and some old ones going to the same place. But as things went on after my first year stuff just changed so much, most of my friends I knew before college grew distant and I never knew why, some of my new class mates began mocking me nearly every day due to failing a few modules of first year but still managing to pass them during resits over the summer at the start I thought it was just a laugh taking the piss with each other but after a while it just felt as direct insults this made me not feel welcome in class which led to me falling behind and inevitably failing second year to which I chose to repeat it the next year. But as this year went on any enjoyment or interest in my course disappeared and with what I feel as constant pressure of “being so smart to do a course like that” which I’m sick of hearing or pressure about getting a degree and a good job. I want to change my course but I feel like I’m too far in and feel that I’ll just get more judgement from people for giving up on what I started off with and this thought brought me to tears for the first time in a long time. I’ve taken the first step by planning a meeting with a careers officer in my college but it’s explaining to others especially my family has me worried of what they’ll think I just want to know that what I’m doing is the best choice;So recently college has had me feeling extremely stressed out and on the verge of a an anxiety attac;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-18 18:23:36;2024-04-18;Thursday;18:23:36;1701;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:19.558419

1c79ypu;Am I imagining things?;badumtastic1;I grew up with an abusive father and have two younger sisters. The youngest one is intellectually disabled and lives with my parents now as me and my sister have moved out and live in different countries. Because of how I grew up and what happened to me, I keep having these terrible thoughts that my father is sexually and physically abusing my youngest sister. Not that he ever sexually abused me, physically he did though. He has a terrible temper and does not like hearing NO. My sister is verbal but cannot communicate her thoughts and feelings at all. I felt like I was the only one who could understand her but since I'm not there with her anymore, the situation troubles me a lot. I cannot sleep easily at night because of these thoughts, and everytime I see any kind of bruise on her and her being neglected by my parents (which she was, and this is why her condition became so severe), these negative thoughts enter my brain. Its getting difficult to focus on daily tasks when I'm alone due to this situation. I don't think I can easily discuss this with my mother. She trusts my father and has seen her fair share of shitty men but I know that she feels like she can't get away from my father because she and my sister are too dependent on her (which is what he wanted). I cannot discuss this with my younger sister (middle one) as well because she will never understand. Her relationship with my parents has been completely different from mine. How do I deal with this? Is getting therapy the only way to fix it? How do I get rid of these negative thoughts. I'm worried that this will be a big hinderence in me starting a family of my own because I will then have too many things to worry about.;I grew up with an abusive father and have two younger sisters.

1c79xbs;Can people freeze you? Am I hypnotized? ;dextercoffee;This is from my point of view. Went to the club once. There was a girl that met another group of guys spent all night with them. I have no affiliation with them . After light on . We all walked together. I had few shots some mixtures . I was wasted but not wasted I think. She wanted someone to save her. I heard that much. I was not going to intervene . Like she drunk 500 dollar worth of drink from that guy now she want some to save her from them. I ain’t Mr.saveahoe. He was gentle man about it . “You can have her if you pay me 500 dollars”. Me like at this point  I am just hungry 🤤. I want food and a comfy bed. So I went about minding my own business. Come home days and days go by Norma nothing out the norm. So later I heard that girl got S.A by those guys. Now the girls father wants revenge against everyone that was in that club that day. Enter evil human … I don’t know how they found me but they found me. She befriends few of my relatives. That I occasionally converse with. Learns my daily routine. Gained entry to my house by offering sex to my father (he had a spare key) . They can go at it I do not care. Gains access to all my passwords. I have a nest at the house. She has Video feed of inside the house. So I just walked around naked. She would break in whenever I am sleeping or passed out . Take pictures to show proof. She stuffed something down my ear once I caught her and her boyfriend but it’s a white girl . I am brown grown man. She told him to get my gun. So I complained when right back to sleep. Now after that event I hear a loud buzzing sound from my left ear. It never went away. She would go around telling people she can control me by telling them my daily routine. Telling me option that I would find interesting. Sometimes I did them other times no cause it was not beneficial for me. So basically implanting ideas or manifesting ideas in my head. Okay . Now hear a command like stop all motor functions. And I freeze and I do not remember what happened in that time frame I comply with what ever they ask. Mostly money and cigarettes or minisquall items. I find I have no longer possession of. She hypnotizes me one of those days she broke in . I faintly can recall . But again I have no proof. She changed the keyword after she learned that everyone is just turning me off to take money. Because of her I move to a different country hoping that she would stop persuasing me as a subject. Remember she befriended most of my family member so there is no escaping her. Evil people do exist if given opportunity especially young white innocent girls . My main question is how do I un hypnotize myself? Or I do I have to live like this forever. She Is making money by displaying me as her project . Going around and telling people that she can control people . Please advise. There is no getting rid of her.;This is from my point of view. Went to the club once.

1c79diq;Intimate Feeling;SwimmingNormal7183;I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently and don’t know how to change my perspective. No one person is the same and I just have really low self esteem about anything intimate but I am not currently in a relationship. I still think about it though as I find it may be important in my future, but whenever it comes to intimate things, thoughts, actions. All I can think about is how I will inevitably disappoint the receiving party. I haven’t hurt myself in a while but when thinking about how to (probably in the future at some point) try and make someone feel good, I would rather tarnish my own body and have even thought about ending my life because I have so much self hatred in that aspect of my life. If the point of life is to grow old and hopefully reproduce and keep the world rolling, then why can’t I make other people feel good, it may just be better if I weren’t here to try or destroy myself enough to where people wouldn’t want me. I just couldn’t do enough in past relationships so those ended and I don’t know how I would do enough in the future. I’m a dude, I don’t think it is that hard to please me, or any dude for that matter, but when it comes to the intricacies of the female body I just can’t do it. I cry trying to figure things out and it just makes me wanna die, not that’s females are intricate and complex but knowing that my future endeavors will probably never amount to anything.

1c7931q;Help me fix my life;toast1172927;"I’m 23 and I live with my parents. I don’t expect that to change anytime soon since there’s a housing crisis where I live. But for frame of reference, I have strict parents and don’t get much privacy. I haven’t worked in over a year. I got fired because I was calling in sick too often. I was calling in sick too often because I’m an alcoholic. I’ve hid it well from everyone and doubt I’ll ever tell them as I think that would do more harm than good at this point. For about 3 years I drank between 350ml-1L of liquor almost everyday. In the past  year I’ve gotten that down to like 2-4L a month, but I’d like to quit completely. I can handle my booze surprisingly well, it’s just the damage it’s done to my bank account and my body is the issue. Part of why I haven’t applied to many jobs is that I’m insecure of my resume. I have only a couple completed courses of post-secondary education. I’ve flunked out of 3 programs now. I chose programs that I had no interest in and that didn’t work with my skill set. I have a very small group of friends and I’ve grown apart from all of them. I feel like a stable set of friends could really better things for me. I’m very shy and haven’t made any effort to get out over the past few years. I’ve got that stupid illogical type of anxiety that makes me terrified to do things I know aren’t terrifying. I’ve been through 5 therapists and didn’t make any progress with any of them. I find it impossible to open up to loved ones let alone a stranger (ironic I’m spilling my guts about it in this post). I’m a very secretive person. Despite knowing about it since 8th grade, I’m only just now coming to terms with the fact that I have a paraphilia. One that if I ever acted on it, would cause a lot of harm. I’ll never act on it, I just think about it a lot. It’s been a major source of shame and isolation in my life. I know this is immature to say, but I guess my issue is that I can’t stick to anything without there being a reward at the end. Back when I was working, I was just switching back and forth from one uncomfortable environment (work) to the next (home). I don’t get enjoyment out of stuff like food and watching movies and other things I used to enjoy (I’m on medication for depression but they could be sugar pills for all they’re worth). Very rarely do I see my friends and when I do it always just feels like a chore. Majority of my shortcomings have been my fault. Part of why I’ve acted the way I have is because I always assumed I’d have ended things by now, but for the first time in my life I’ve decided against that. I want to be a better person. I want the people in my life that I’ve depended so heavily on to be proud of me. I want to be happy.

1c78tsz;Why does studying make me sad?;HuGrUn4r;"Hello everyone!So, I'm in last grade of high school (which ends at 19yo here) and my final exams are in three weeks, so I'm slowly getting to work at home to be sure to be prepared for that time (obviously it's kinda stressful so keep that in mind).I'm currently seeing a therapist that helps me a lot, I've seen her for about a year and a half and we've done so much work together. High school made me really sad and I had that feeling of really heavy emptiness inside of me (maybe a depression or burn out, I don't really know), funny things, I didn't even realized that I was in that state until a friend of mine told me that I wasn't laughing anymore and that I seemed sad all the time, and obviously I was like ""oh no I'm not like that!"" Until I realized that I actually was.Oh and also I really hate school now, there's not a single thing that drives me to it, not even my friends. But obviously I keep going there like a good little sheep haha.So yea, that was for context, now the question: I think that studying makes me sad? I've just realized now that I've been doing the bare minimum to pass school for and so far it's going well, and I'm kinda thinking that this bare minimum is actually because studying makes me in a shitty mood. I just found this out right now and I'd like to know if anyone feels the same!Ask me any question if you have some, so we can understand a bit more what's going through my head.Much love to y'all, tomorrow's another day<33";Hello everyone!So, I'm in last grade of high school (which ends at 19yo here) and my final exams are;Question;4;1;2024-04-18 17:15:30;2024-04-18;Thursday;17:15:30;1467;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:19.571056

But it's weeks between each piece, most days i feel too tired to even pick up the pencil. I am a junior in college, I have a small friend group. We hang out pretty often.But part of me is so alone. This is the millionth post about this. But I haven't even kissed a girl. Not a hug, not a hand held, nor even a valentines day card. I never dated in high school because I was too focused on getting good grades. Not like I was interesting enough to catch girls eyes anyway. There were a few girls I saw myself pursuing, but I never did for one reason or another. Mainly, I just didn't feel like I needed a relationship.In college, that feeling remained. But now it was FOMO, I never experienced awkward high school flings, proms or anything. I turned 21 and realized... I was never wanted by someone. I know I'm loved deeply by my parents and siblings. And liked by my friends. But it's not the same. In college I am always worried about grades, I know shouldn't. ""C's get degrees"" and all that. So I never pursued women, never really noticed women in that light. All because I'm too focused on work. And I thought I was happy single. Turns out I'm not.This isn't a post about desiring to lose my virginity, im okay being a virgin, from scrolling here,  i get its over rated. And ive accepted itll happen when it happens, but I'm not okay with being this alone for so long. I don't know how to be a fucking human anymore. I want to mean something to someone, to have a girl to hold. To be held.Dating apps don't work, either they don't respond, are bots, or stand me up on the first date.I've grown apart from some of my closest friends from my childhood. We just moved away, stopped texting, different schools. And I'm afraid that after graduation I will be alone. I hear stories about the struggles of making friends as an adult, and I already have enough trouble now. I don't drink, and parties give me migrains, so clubs and bars are a no-go. All the girls in my school are either taken or gay. Even if they aren't I'm too much of a coward to do anything. I'm terrified to make mistakes. The few clubs I go to. I don't know how to talk to women, I don't know if they are taken, or if I'm even decent enough looking. I know I shouldn't expect a girl to move first. But I've never gotten a hint of interest from anyone.I don't want to live my life focused on grades anymore, I want to actually breath, I want to meet someone, I want to live.And yes, I know, I know '21 is still young, you're just a baby' but I'm still so, so tired.

1c78i5u;Had MH problems for years, now my friends seem to be sick of me ;_EndlessSummer;"So, I (29 F) have had mental health problems all of my teenage-adult life. I have always struggled with my self worth and how others perceived me etc. Recently, I had the lowest low I've ever had, it hit me like a ton of bricks and I couldn't get out. I eventually went to the Dr's got some different medication and tried going on with my life.Lots of things have happened in my life recently, family members being diagnosed with cancer, others dying etc, and although you'll be thinking, heck you're nearly 30... I haven't ever had a member of my family die or be THIS ill.Anyway, onto the situation at hand. I had a huge argument with my best friends (both 29F) during this lowest low and ever since, although we have made up I genuinely feel they don't want me in their lives anymore.I gave them an ""out"" I told them if they didn't want a friendship (I've been friends with them for 16 yrs and 14yrs, although they have only known each other for 2 years) then I was giving them a guilt free trip to just up and go. Both of them said I was ridiculous and they want to be my friend. Since that, they have booked a holiday together, just the two of them and asked me last minute (knowing I can't go at that time). One friend decided that on the day of my 30th it's more important to be seeing a band than to be spending it with me. (To most it wouldn't be a big deal but I just couldn't do that to her cause I'd want to spend that special day with her).But most importantly, they both seem to have dropped off the face of the Earth. We were supposed to meet later to arrange a weekend away for our 30th birthdays, but honestly I don't want to. I've cancelled going tonight, but I'm also not well, so I wouldn't go anyway. I just don't feel that they ACTUALLY want me in their lives anymore. I live a 5 minute walk from one and I haven't seen her in weeks. I also asked that same friend if we could book a holiday and she laughed and told me I wouldn't be able to afford it. But she got upset that I said I would go to a festival but was unsure at the weekend away for our birthday (because of money). I've been there for them through their lowest of lows and I never argued with them, I just stuck by them daily and kept making sure that if there was anything I could do, I'd do it. (Like taking their favourite chocolate around or something minor, or just going to sit and let them cry). Break-ups, family members passing, anything and everything I could be. I honestly don't know what I've done wrong. Maybe my mental health has finally become too much for them, maybe I'm just the burden I've always believed I am. Maybe they've realised that they're happier without me in their lives, I don't know.Before anyone says speak to them, I have I've voiced how I feel and I've been basically told it's my mental health making me think this way. But basically now I'm lower than I was before, I'm honestly sick of feeling like I'm always the last option. They're supposed to be my best friends, but I feel I have lost both of them. Also my mental health has hit rock bottom again, I'm meeting with a MH person from the Drs soon, but I feel I may need to contact them before that meeting. I'm at a complete loss, I don't know if this post is going to make me feel better or worse about the situation but I'm absolutely sick of sitting and crying over the same shit.

1c78caw;My roommate kinda creeps me out;theConsummateProf;So I (24M) have been living with my roommate for about a year. He was a good friend from high school and college, and I was down on my luck so I confided in him like I’d like a roommate and some other things that were kinda going wrong in my life. He agreed and we moved in. We moved down here with the specific intent to come out of our shells a little bit, meet new people, and just have a good time down here. I really quickly picked up that he wasn’t really interested in doing that despite what he told me (he would start shaking whenever I mentioned something to him, indicating to me that he was scared). After a couple of times I thought, alright he’s shy, if he wants to eventually he’ll let me know. This didn’t really deter me as I kept going out and I’ve made a lot of progress in that department. I feel like I can hold a conversation with strangers now and it’s done a lot for my confidence. He’s stayed in for the most part and I can tell (and he’s told me) that his confidence started to dwindle. He can’t drive so I have to take him back to our hometown every couple of weeks (I don’t necessarily mind because that’s what I wanted to do to visit my folks) so we have conversations in the car.He’s noticing a lot more about me than I notice about him. I have a full time job (granted, it’s remote) but he doesn’t as a college student. He’ll tell me things that make him mad that I said weeks ago and then accuse me of not being direct. If I don’t engage with his interests all the time, he starts getting pouty and mean. He definitely says shit behind my back (a practice that I’ve stopped at this point) and I can tell because my other friends say things about me indirectly when we’re hanging out. There was one time when I coming back from work on a long commute and he texted me that he was checking my snap map. He will criticize me a lot and make little comments that are starting to irk me. He’s just a friend but it’s starting to feel like a bit of a marriage to me and it’s annoying. I’m just starting to get tight lipped so I don’t say anything but we’re both home quite a lot. The only time I really feel better is when I’m going out. He’ll also say things that make me really uneasy as to whether or not he has empathy (downplay anxiety, problems other people have). He’s extremely socially undercooked and I think it’s starting to take a toll. Guys don’t generally act like this right?Thing is, we’ve both confided some personal information that I’d really not let out because I thought he was being a good friend (that’s what I was doing at least), but now I’m just on edge honestly. I don’t know whether I’m in the wrong bc it’s only one half of the story, but he won’t tell me what’s bothering him and I don’t feel like I have anyone on my side. I just want to shut up around him but this shit is getting annoying.What’s going on here?;So I (24M) have been living with my roommate for about a year.

1c78b9k;My classmates laughed at me when my grandmother died.;DarkEntity13;First of all, my childhood dog died last year. A couple of my haters laughed me out loud and made a joke about it. Honestly I didn't expect such a reaction from them, my anxiety was too intense and I couldn't defend myself.a little context: there was a girl in my class who was bullied. She was my friend, so they started bullying me too after a while when she left. I was the quiet kid but I always stand up for myself if they bullied me.My grandmother died a month before graduation. They had a similar reaction. The next day they greeted me with this message: my name and my grandmother’s name were written on the board. of course it was an evil message, not empathetic. they literally wrote that it was good that she died. this was meant as a “joke”. the bullies laugh, and those who didn't laugh ignored the whole thing, even my only “friend”. I was silent, traumatised, my hands were shaking, I tried not to cry or panic. I didn't do anything to deserve this!! I felt that the whole world was against me for no reason. the teachers did not help. The teacher's answer: I'm 18 years old man, I should protect myself, he won't help.This in front of the whole class. The result was that I tried to kill myself with a knife. Almost made it. I Hate those scars. I regretted it. Few weeks after the father of one of my classmates also died. they didn't treat him like me. they helped him through this difficult time.Final exams were approaching. they didn't share the material with me, they wanted me to fail. I graduated high school with good grades. They are so jealous. Sweet revenge. I post my vacation on my instagram to make them jealous. After that I deleted all my social media, because I became paranoid.I have social anxiety, I'm afraid of people and I don't have a job, while the people who did this to me are happy and have jobs or are in college. Karma does not exist. I don't have a single friend, I'm all alone. I can’t trust nobody. I'm currently in therapy and I'm getting better but I'm very tired. I had a job during school, I worked and saved, but I'm running out of money. My Mom support me. I hope it gets easier soon..sorry if there are a lot of mistakes, I can't focus.

1c783sa;Addictive personality;Internal-Dingo-2555;I’m aware that I’m very young (F21) but the further I progress in college the more my addictive personality truly scares me. My dad is an alcoholic and also has a very addictive personality, where when he’d try to quit he would eat more sweets/start smoking/ chewing tobacco etc. The older I get, the more I realize I am exactly the same, which is terrifying. So for a bit of a back story :  I started vaping at 15/16 (stupid I know, but everyone else was doing it and I had easy access in highschool), I’ve tried to quit multiple times and always end up going back or replacing it with something worse. I “quit” vaping back in January, but yet can’t stop myself from hitting a friends vape whenever I’m around it. I’ve resorted to looking forward to a singular cigarette and a glass of wine after a stressful day, but the other day I smoked a cigarette completely sober. I refuse to start smoking cigarettes as a new vice.   When I first started college (3 years ago), my drinking habits became so bad that I was putting a strain on my friends and family relationships. I mean, every weekend we would have a “girls night” and every weekend I would blackout and never remember the night before. I was dealing with other mental issues back then and have since cut back and learned some self-control when it comes to remaining coherent in the bars. When I stopped drinking so much, and tried to quit vaping I turned to smoking marijuana/ carts. Two years ago-I cut down on drinking, but picked up smoking. It started off as a fun social activity, but soon got to the point to where I couldn’t sleep at night or function throughout the day without it. I quit for about 8 months (my vaping habits increased when I quit), however I’ve gone back to it again recently and forced myself to stop again (it’s been a little over a week since the last time I got high) I’m very aware of my obsession with things and have tried more “healthy” options like working out. But that soon became a problem as well as I became obsessed and over exercised constantly and severely under-ate. When I tried to combat this and stop working out as much, I went to the complete opposite end of the spectrum. I completely stopped working out and became obsessed with binge eating,( I gained about 40 pounds in only a few months). I feel like I can never find a middle ground in anything I do.  I’ve been dealing with drug/alcohol/food overuse and “too much of a good thing” for over 4 years now and I am completely exhausted and dissatisfied with myself for never having control. I can’t wrap my head around never being able to find a middle ground. Why does it always have to be all or nothing? I can recognize that I have a problem, but only end up worsening another vice when I try to quit one and it’s driving me insane. I also find myself incredibly bored/missing something when I have nothing as a vice. TLDR: I’ve struggled with addictions between smoking, drinking, exercising, and eating. I can never do anything in moderation. As I grow older, it’s getting very tiring to feel like I have 0 self control.  Any tips/alternative activities are appreciated.;I’m aware that I’m very young (F21) but the further I progress in college the more my addictive pers;Content Warning: Addiction / Substance Abuse;5;4;2024-04-18 16:46:38;2024-04-18;Thursday;16:46:38;3136;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:19.574513

So a bit about myself, I’m an international student living with my high school friends in a rental, far away from home and my family. It’s been 2 years now that I’ve been living here. I’m 22 and in my final year at uni for my undergrad degree. I work a part time job too to cover my expenses and try to pay my tuition myself. Ever since i was a kid, i haven’t been able to make real connections with anyone. Even with my family, i don’t feel i have a real, meaningful connection. Same goes with the people I’m living with. They all have a very good connection between them and this makes me feel very lonely. I started drinking thinking it might help to push these feelings away but doesn’t. I have nothing to fall back to if i break down and feel like ending it all. I wasn’t enough capable enough to find a girlfriend and have been single forever while my friends and almost all people i know have either been in a relationship or are in one. I am not very outgoing and barely socialise. I can’t take this anymore and feel like killing myself soon. What do i do to get better at all?

1c77t70;Being told to pray ;Alive-Discipline8814;My mom is killing me. I’ve been seeing a therapist for a few months because I just have these mood swings that are so drastic and so up and down. I don’t ever feel like I have a baseline. Bare with me in this post because I’m writing this in the heat of the moment. I feel like my body is vibrating or buzzing because of how overstimulated I am right now. Basically I haven’t gotten sleep in the past three days. Which is normal for me to sometimes have these moments where one night I stay up all night and never on purpose. I just don’t feel tired. I work as a cna at the hospital and Sunday night I stayed up, Monday night I got two hours of sleep, Tuesday I worked my 12 hour shift, Tuesday night I got one hour of sleep and last night I got maybe 3 or 4. But my brain on those nights sometimes is just going 10,000 mph. I feel like I can’t slow my thoughts down. I feel like I want to do everything in the world. I will literally plan out the next year of my life by the day. I started all these art projects Monday and Sunday  night, where are they now? Unfinished. So anyway today I’m telling my mom that I feel like I can’t function. That I feel like my body is so tired I just can’t even function. I basically feel like I’m coming down from my high I think that’s what’s happening. I think I’m slipping into a low and it’s about to get dark. I think. I really don’t know. But she starts bursting out into a full on prayer and is like “you’re letting your body control you. You’re letting your body take over”. And so she starts praying to God and saying this stuff about “please give her good sleep, please help her body stop doing this to her”. And it is just frustrating because then she’s like “you know God says he gives his beloved good sleep” so am i not one of his beloved???? Idk I’m just frustrated. I’m frustrated with my body my brain, my mom. I’m frustrated because this isn’t normal. I don’t feel like this is normal. I don’t feel like I should be having these extremes and I wish that when I talk to my mom about it that the only response wasn’t God or it’s what you’re eating.;My mom is killing me.

I guess identity crisis is an easier term. talking to people has always been hard and left me feeling exhausted after every interaction due to all the brain power it took to try to come up with appropriate responses. I've also felt like I've lived half of my life in a daydream purely in my head. not to mention my inability to learn like everyone else.. I've always been slower than others when it came to learning and asking for help felt shameful even when I'm told to ask for help. And when I do ask for help, it feels like I'm asking too much and I can noticeably see their patience running out. you can imagine me as a timid anxiety induced introverted person. Alot goes into play of how I was raised as well and I've spent half my life trying to figure out why I am the way I am. I won't lie and say I'm not suicidal because of how much I hate how inadequate I am. why does living come so easily to others? can I ever change? either way, I know I'm mentally ill and I want to try to get better before calling it quits  but when I try to look for resources everything just muddles up. and it leaves me feeling more useless than before.. i may as well be illiterate at this point. when people search up services, how do they know its a legit service? either way I just wanted to ask for how others schedule/find their therapy/psychiatrist appointments. i would really appreciate it if someone gave me pointers, thankyou.;To start with, I've never used anything like Reddit for help but I figured since I'm already at rock;Question;0;1;2024-04-18 16:31:39;2024-04-18;Thursday;16:31:39;1873;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:17.058724

Today, I finally got one. It's part time, minimum wage and the hours aren't great, but it's something. And I'm going to start disciplining myself more with what I eat, trying to avoid my unnecessary cravings and work out at home until I become strong enough to go back to the gym.I'm currently more happy than I have been in a long time. I finally have some energy left in me to get up and clean my room, to get up and shower. To make myself dinner rather than put myself in a bigger debt by ordering food. I've been wanting to go on walks, get back into my hobbies, try to learn new thinhs such as how to play chess. I'm learning to accept that friendships cone and go, and sometimes it's better to quit chasing people for their acceptance and attention. Even if it means I lose people who I thought were my closest friends. It gets better. Going through pain is a huge part of life nobody likes to admit.

Meditation doesn't work, breathing exercises don't work (when I'm anxious, I often feel paralyzed), and cold showers don't help either. I've tried medication like lexapro for five months, but it hasn't helped. I also tried Vistaril, but that didn't work either.

Will I ever get a turn? Or will I be stuck on the sidelines forever, watching my friends and family play the game I so desperately want to join in on. I feel powerless and overwhelmed by my fragile psychological state. I can’t take it anymore. I can’t avoid this person close to me or the others we love and know so well, and I don’t want to avoid them anyway. But how else can I cope with what feels like emotional betrayal? Everyone knew my dream and how hard I worked toward it. I feel like they’re rubbing my failure in my face, but I know that’s just my trauma talking. Trauma-induced grief is hard.

He has a few mental issues (some of them led to the cause of the break-up), but was not open to discuss some of them with me and was hiding those from me.

This fear of mine is amplified by the fact that he is also hiding the issues from me (I can’t estimate if they are small or not) and is not open to let me know, let me help or just be there for him. I don’t want to eventually need to leave and mess with his heart again, because I love him and he deserves stability. What should I do? How should I approach this?

I’m in Uni right now and I did a quiz worth 20% today and I think I absolutely fumbled it and I also got a quiz back with results which were not up to my standards and I’ve been going down a spiral. Realistically I know that there are other ways to get into med and I know two quizzes aren’t going to screw up my entire life. But I feel like I have screwed up too many times in the past. I didn’t have a direction during high school so I majorly screwed up there. First year of uni I didn’t have any direction either so another huge screw up.

1c73c4k;Severe depression from long distance relationship, still desperate after more than 2 years;Few-Reindeer1316;We met in 2018 through working at the same company. She (23 at the time) lives in the US, I (31 at the time) live in Germany. It started to become a very serious long distance relationship very quickly. Through our employer we were able to see each other quite regularly every 2-3 months for at least 4 weeks. The job ended in late 2019. With a good amount of severance payment, I took a timeout and lived with her in the US for a few months. Then covid happened, I had to leave the country and for now things got a bit more complicated. At this point no one knew how long this would be going on so we stayed loyal. The travel ban for US citizens eased roughly 6 months later so she was able to come to Germany for a while. She visited me 2 times for 8 weeks and also came for a very brief visit in the summer of 2021 for my best friends wedding. So about 1.5 years into the pandemic I was still banned from travelling to USA. Things obviously became quite draining. My mom became sick during this time and was taking care of her. Emotionally I was already at a very low point, but not really seeing it myself. Germany was on full lockdown during his whole time, the US was already going back to normal for quite some time. We were in touch each and every day, she started going out more often again, I was isolated all by myself. Our communication wasn’t always great due to these extreme circumstances but we would assure each other unconditioned love all the time. Around September 2021, maybe 2 months after we saw for the wedding, (btw which was wrecking for me being the best man, having to care for so many people why not receiving any care myself for so long) it was finally announced that the travel ban will lifted. No two days later I receive a call from her in the morning that she wants to end the relationship. I fainted, I couldn’t believe what was happening. I waited so long, I was so loyal to her. She didn’t even give me the chance to see her again and I myself had doubts we can continue this way, but I was hoping for us having a serious conversation in person. I struggle with traumatic experiences from my childhood and other relationships so it just completely blew my lights off. At first she was asking for a break or an open relationship. A week later she said she was just trying to comfort me and actually ended the relationship. She was ice-cold during all these conversation, while I was constantly in tears. I didn’t know who this person as any longer. Well, It sucked, we were still on lockdown in Germany so I wasn’t really able to go out and find distraction. A couple weeks into this, I started to distance myself from her. That’s when the real misery started. Whenever I stopped texting her for a week, she would pull me back. Wether it being pictures of her crying, simple messages how much she still loves me etc etc. Usually a day after that she would turn ice-cold again. It became really hard on my mental health, I wasn’t able to live on as whenever I gained strength, she’d do it again. Around New Years 2022 I started seeing someone else, it wasn’t to serious but I was able to have some distraction finally and it helped me understand there is other people than her. So I stopped texting her. I even relocated into a different city to start all over again. Surprise, just two weeks into my “new” life, she arrived in Germany to visit me. As my heart was still with her after all, I was throwing everything I gained so far over board and spent the week with her. Everything was back to normal all of a sudden. She kissed me the moment she arrived, called herself my girlfriend, we were intimate together. There was a lot of arguments of course as deep down I was so mad about all this. She left again as she had started a new job back home, but we kept in touch and she would call me every morning and we started saying I love you daily again. Things were off though, I got mad many times as she constantly left me in the grey. She never said we are not together, but also didn’t really commit to anything. Anyways she asked me to come visit her in spring (2022). So I followed up with these plans.. when I was about to plan my travel, she started pushing the dates back a few times. I got so mad about this, because at this time I had not visited her for over 2.5 years.. how could going to a techno festival with your friend be so much important now? Or at least why don’t invite me join? We had many heated arguments and our communications became very short lived. One day a friend of mine sent me an article (she works in music so has some public stuff going on). I read through the thing and she talked about touring Europe very soon.. I was shocked, we talked this whole time and she didn’t even mention this to me? I asked her whats up with that and if we should not at least meet up for a day or two. She denied and cut me off saying we should have a break at talking for a month to two. I was shocked but let her go. The whole situation became more complicated as suddenly I received a booking request (I work in music too) to perform on the same night as her in European city. To this day I don’t know if this happened randomly or what was behind it. I cancelled the show to respect her wish to not see me on her trip (this although I wasn’t able to do my job properly all through pandemic, I should have been more selfish here, I know). Well, a few weeks alter I was performing at a festival and was shocked when many colleagues approached me about having hung out with her the last weeks. These were all people I introduced her to originally, I felt betrayed or at least very confused so I thought it would be best to talk this through with her as I found the situation very unfair towards me. She wanted space and time, but basically didn’t give me my space by incorporating herself into my circles (she lives overseas after all). I reached out and didn’t get a reply (I saw her being online and she is the kind that usually replies to anything within seconds), I tried calling her with no success. I felt so disrespected, that I went on a little rage to get a reply from her. One morning I find myself blocked on every single channel possible. No words, just being full time ignored. It felt terrible, I went nuts in my mind and had to find help at a psychiatric hospital. I didn’t understand the world any more. I started seeing a therapist whenever possible, I had several panic attacks daily, I was having suicidal thoughts. Was I being ghosted now? My apartment was still full of all the stuff she left behind (she tried moving once during one of her visits, but that is another story). Suitcases full of clothes, books etc. I packed it all in boxes and shipped it to her moms house (as I couldn’t even find out her current address). 4 months later when I finally started to cool down, there she appears again in my text messages. A very delusional message, she said she is not mad at all and so thankful I sent her the package .. “much love” .. I tried to not reply for a few days as I knew it wouldn’t be good for me to go back into communication. But well, I had to let her know how badly treated I felt and that I spent intense time in psychiatric help since this happening. She snapped and cut me off again not showing the tiniest understanding for my situation. This is 16 months ago now and I have tried to find peace with her many times since but I keep on being blocked and not answered to. I am still in therapy and the last couple of days I was extremely triggered about this again for unknown reason. I have strong suicidal thoughts. Her actions make me feel so miserable, I constantly feel it is all my fault. I don’t know anymore if I will ever get over this. Am I in the wrong here? I know she has every right to cut me off.. but things could have been much more easier for me if she would make a clear cut and not let me tap in the dark. It feels like she tries to keep control over me. TLDR: Long distance relationship went downhill during pandemic and ended with ghosting/blocking and severe mental health issues for me;We met in 2018 through working at the same company.

1c730jq;Do you think theres any hope ? ;Soft_Professional455;I am (26m)  who’s got caught in a rough period of addiction at the end of high school and there on after. ..The rockstar lifestyle of doing drugs, drinking and partying.. Because of my arrogance i failed to really work on or build my life.If that wasn’t enough i started to have seizures and discovered i had a rare congenital brain abnormality called an Avm.  That period of life i thought i wasn’t going to be myself ever again, because of the seizures, and the possible effects of the surgery. Everything went well with my surgery , when i got home i had been in this cocooned state which is where i felt most happy. I had forgot about real world things, i har focused my entirety of my well being on trying to recoup , and stay positive.. To tell you the truth.. i had planned to jump off a bridge because of how i was feeling, almost hopeless. I felt like the odd ball and the thought of not being here was easier to accept. I could and still can’t imagine myself living anywhere around 40.. i’m 26 and i feel that because of everything I’ll never catch up. I’ll never unstick myself out of a state of reclusiveness.. Ive shut out all my friends, i destroyed my ego from having a few embarrassing hook ups , and i just don’t know.. There’s not many i can or will ever relate to so i just kind of put on this persona I’ve made( in place of the old me ) It’s sad and to some it could be funny I was kind of a jerk before this all Or i was becoming one .This humbled me, made me think more humanistic , but i guess im scared to live now .Before i didn’t really care if i died in action but i just started to become grateful as my friend lost his dad who used to be of great company for everyone. A person i met for one night, his name we call him ‘Farrel’  I met farrel one day my friend threw me a surprise birthday party. I later learned in life he died from a drug overdose. I felt saddened because i knew obviously hearing that nobody was there for him. I spent the night at Farrels house after my birthday party . He asked if i wanted to make some music ( us both enjoying music) I declined when i saw a plate on his room floor with chicken bones. After he passed I checked out his music and i regretted myself not making another decision.. Thats one story but baseline is After everything im traumatized To open up and take action. I work a 9-5 warehouse job  which im trying to find fulfillment in but everyday i find myself not really making a life id like to.. This was just a vent because my friends, i don’t think they’re really my friends, the only support ive had is family.. even my “ closet” of friends , they never appeared.. I kept one solid relationship but with someone i believe is mentally ill, someone i kept trying to support because i felt he was dangerous to the world..

1c72vg0;Am I in any potential harm?;jessiee223;Ok for context so this guy I knew from high school had a crush on me and would always make comments about how hot I am and stuff didn’t really think that much of it, any way a while later after I left school we ended up hooking up…. I hooked up with him like 3 times in total I didn’t have any feelings for him and I think he knew this, but anyways I ended up meeting my now ex boyfriend and he was my first love although we were a toxic couple. We started dating when I was 16 and were on and off again till I was 18 or 19 until we ended it for real anyways he ends up befriending my ex and they became best friends  when I was still dating my ex but he didn’t seem bothered or jealous from what I could tell anyways….at this point now I was 20 and I went out to a club with a friend I used to have and we see him he ends up drinking with us, he invited us back to a hotel he had gotten. So I ended up sleeping there and when I woke up he confessed how he’s loved me for years and had to see me with another guy and doesn’t understand why I was with him and he could give me everything I could ever want I kept rejecting him but he continued to beg me to be with him and say how he was In love with me, anyway he tried reaching out and would switch moods very quickly with me from being nice to saying how I need to pay him back for all the money he wasted on me from that night, I ended up blocking him thinking that was the end of it. Recently I have gotten close with that same ex I am now 22, my old friend that I am no longer friends with reached out to me telling me that this same guy has been asking multiple people about my whereabouts and offering people money to hurt me. It has been 2 years or so and don’t know why he is doing this and it is really starting to scare me I told my ex about what has happened and he told me that he has gotten into drugs and he has mental problems and schizophrenia but I don’t understand what this fixation that he might have for me I don’t want to get hurt, or my ex.  I’m thinking he might’ve found out that me and my ex are starting to get close again. I have no idea, some of my friends think to inform the police but I don’t think that i need to at this point.

1c72gx7;I am afraid I can’t function as an Adult;jjestah;Hello. My(17NB) name is Ashley. I have been struggling with any form of structure in my life for years. I cannot eat ‘correctly’ (whether that be healthy, timed, etc.), and I believe I suffer from multiple mental disorders(ASD, BPD, ADHD). I cannot remember a time where I did not have trouble with anything, or I was not in trouble for not doing things as I should. I got bad grades in school and a a few suspensions, too. My dad was an alcoholic when I was young, and I think it left me with wounds that are festering as I age. I am afraid. I am close to adulthood, and I can’t function as a person. I can’t properly socialize, even in primary school I was ostracized, and my response then was violence I learned from home. I have had one job, and I could not hold it because I had to move back in with my dad after my mother prioritized abusive lovers over me and my sibling. Nowhere else has hired me, and now I am scared I can’t hold a job anymore because I am realizing that I have become extremely depressed in the two years since, and that I developed some form of circadian sleep disorder. I have no structure and for the months so far this year that I have tried to fix my issues, I failed every time and got worse. I started antidepressants, tried multiple SSRIS and the most they seem to do is make nasty thoughts into a duller drone farther in the back of my mind. I do not think I can survive adulthood and I am afraid I will let myself get worse until I don’t. I do not understand how to help myself anymore. I am sorry for the text wall.. I just want to be heard, to be understood. I sincerely hope I can figure myself out, and if anybody else feels this same way, we are not alone. Thank you if you read this far.;Hello.

1c727iz;My attention problems?;LilKurb;I hope this is the right subreddit for that kind of stuff. Idk if gender and age are important here so just in case im (M22).So anyways I think I should first explain the situation and then how i feel about this.Also I apologise for my english its not my native language and i don't know all the right names for some stuff.I have already failed 3 driving exams. So today I had driving lesson with one of my acquaintance. And I almost crashed. Well in my opinion i had everything under control after I realised that i made mistake and tried not to panic.  So i was approaching to intersection and i had two traffic signs for that, one was to give way (white triangle with red border) and the second one was showing the main road system. So anyway i had to give way at that intersection but i didn't. And my acquaintance said that i almost crashed and we were this close to be dead. Although like i said at least i felt like even though mistakes were made i had it under control in terms of not making any car accidents. And all that situation was because of i didn't notice these two signs. And it made me feel soo bad. Like i consider myself a car enthusiast, i want to learn to drive and have fun with my future car projects. But my pessimistic thoughts some times take over me. Like the reason i feel so bad about it, is because i want to be good driver who knows the traffic and can be independent at the there. And sometimes i feel like I shouldn't be driver, cause there are already bad drivers and i don't wanna be one of them. This is not my first time making a such a mistake by not noticing some signs. And i started to think maybe i have some minor adhd level, even tho i took some test online, it says its unlikely. Thats why I came here to ask maybe some of you can notice this pattern and suggest why i might have that i don't notice things. Is there something i can do? Maybe i have lack of some vitamins that slower my brain processing speed. Or its purely something with mental health?;I hope this is the right subreddit for that kind of stuff.

1c725j2;My anxiety has skyrocketed after months of non stop tradgedy in my life ;princvsxx;Last November I went to HR at my job at corporate Dominos because my DM hired a new GM that sexually assaulted one of my friends/coworkers and HR's response was to tell me that I have the same address as another employee (not the one that was sexually assaulted, that was never addressed) and that I was now in trouble and would be forced to move to another store location. The employee handbook states you can only get in trouble for living with a coworker if either they are in a postion above you, or you are in a position above them. This was not the case, we were both delivery drivers. Seeing how twisted this buisness was I quit and picked up doordash instead. On my first delivery with doordash I got into my first ever car accident. This all happens in the span of a month. I pick myself up and get myself a new, better job. Then christmas time rolls around and my only living grandparent who I'm very close with passed away suddenly and unexpectedly due to neglect at the hospital. At the same time my 14 year old cat starts to lose weight very fast and the vets can't figure out whats wrong because his bloodwork looks good. A month later at the end of January he finally stops eating after I literally spoon fed him wet food for months, I take him to the emergency vet and they tell me he has a rare and aggressive type of Lymphoma and I have to euthanize him. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. One week after his death I catch covid from a coworker that lied to the staff about their test results  and refused to stay home. I now have long Covid which left me with permanent lower back pain, insomnia, and GI issues which I'm trying to manage with probiotics. I've been a very anxious person for as long as I can remember but I've reached a whole new level here. Every morning I wake up with my heart racing as if I've been running for my life. I have to close my eyes when I'm a passenger in the car it makes me so scared. The fear paralyzes me every day and it has become almost impossible to do simple things that only used to make me a little nervous before. I'm becoming extremely agoraphobic. I never want to leave my house. I miss the person I was before october of last year. I feel like the shell of the person I was before. I take buspirone daily for anxiety and ativan when I have to do a task that I think will give me a panic attack (doctors appointments have always done this to me due to a lot of childhood trauma that I won't get into) It just feels like since these past few months my anxiety is stronger than my medication now.

1c71pp0;Loneliness is making me a worse person;Unknownninja5;I’m sure there are others with worse problems than me, I’m even hesitant to make this post but here goes. I’m 28M and I’ve been looking for a partner for 6 years now (since my last and only ex girlfriend). I’ve always considered myself to be a decent looking guy, but now I’m not even so sure anymore. Everyday my standards for my ideal match lowers and lowers, today I genuinely have no standards, I wouldn’t even mind dating an ugly drunk cheating junkie. There’s no real place one goes with the sole intention of finding girls. Bars and nightclubs are my personal hell, I can’t stand loud music, I hate dancing and I quit drinking. I’ve tried a dating app, the only 2 real matches I got didn’t even try to hold up a conversation, the 3rd closed the chat before I woke up and saw that I had a match, and the forth didn’t even message (the app requires girls to make the first move). I feel like I’m being emotionally abused there, theybuild my anticipation and watch it crumble. I’ve tried working out, they say it helps with mood, confidence, etc. But nothing, I still feel miserable. Whenever I shoot my shot, I don’t even get friendzoned, I usually just get flat out rejected. I usually try not to be intrusive/invasive/creepy. I try to just be nice and the right amount of caring. But it simply doesn’t land. They usually take the good parts of me for their own benefit but God forbid should they actually try to get to know me. It’s disgusting and honestly it’s pushing me towards misogyny, and I hate it. To the point that I start to actually feel pleasure from actively hating women. And I don’t like this. Even on dating apps, I started to reject girls who I think are actually pretty simply because I start to feel that I have no chance whatsoever. I’m not even after any sexual benefit, just someone who cares about me other than my parents. I just feel angry because I feel that women don’t have to exert the same amount of energy to find someone. I usually get by with the help of drugs but as im trying to stay clean, this has been really hitting me hard, the main reason I decided to quit is because I feel that it makes my social skills terrible which obviously lowers my chances, but right now I’m starting to think it’s not  worth stopping. Ever realize how it’s usually the guys who complain about this? It’s fucking unfair, but feminists strive for “gender equality”, except it’s only misandry.Never in a million years did I think I would be the ahole that would think that way, I’ve always been a cup half full kind of guy, I used to make up excuses for why everyone behaves poorly rather than judge them, I used to be very tolerant and patient, but girls are destroying that part of me.TLDR: I’m sick and tired of being rejected, quitting drugs isn’t helping, neither do workouts. It’s pushing me to misogyny.;I’m sure there are others with worse problems than me, I’m even hesitant to make this post but here ;Content Warning: Addiction / Substance Abuse;0;1;2024-04-18 12:08:54;2024-04-18;Thursday;12:08:54;2832;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:43.505537
1c71onr;Wanting to lay in bed all the time;issatr4p;Hi, I'm 18 and I have ADD and possibly autism (haven't been tested yet but my little brother has it and displays similar characteristics to me) I've also been depressed for a couple of years now. So anyway, I'm currently not going to school because I'm studying for exams to move to a different school. I try to sleep 7-8 hours a night and I usually do, but when I get up I just can't do anything. I take ADHD medication (Concerta/Ritalin) and it does give me more focus but I still can't do anything that I actually need to. My main problem is that whenever I get up and start doing work at my desk, I can only spend like 30mins seated, and then I just go back to bed on my phone. It's a constant cycle, desk-bed-desk-bed and I don't know what to do about it. I have energy but I just cannot sit and do work. Most that I do is randomly watch yt videos or play online games, and look at my study material in between for a couple of minutes. I want to lay in bed all day, and It's been like this for months. I'm on antidepressants, have been for years. Does anyone have any tips? I just can't keep living like this, I want to be productive, I have to study but I just can't get myself to do it.Also just a little bit more about me, I live with my parents, I have 2 brothers, and I share a room with one. I have many special interests that I can't exactly pinpoint but I do constant research into different topics and I've educated myself extensively on topics that have nothing to do with my line of work or study that I want to pursue (aviation, history, geography, astronomy, data analysis and more) I did poorly in middle school because I wasn't diagnosed with ADD/ADHD until I was 15. Even in high school I did poorly, even tho teachers and my psychiatrists/psychologists tell me that I'm pretty smart.;Hi, I'm 18 and I have ADD and possibly autism (haven't been tested yet but my little brother has it ;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-18 12:07:23;2024-04-18;Thursday;12:07:23;1805;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:19.607963

I broke up with her to protect her from what i feared I’d become. But I have nothing else to live for. I gave life a try.Ever since my first failed attempt (I can’t even get that right), I got “help”. Everyone says “don’t do it because the feeling is only temporary”. I did everything I was told to do. Years of therapy (still ongoing), multiple prescription medications, exercise, other relationships, I’ve even tried to become a junky with illicit substances. My only question is when does the feeling stop? Because it hasn’t lifted in my case since that day.I’m a “high performer” at work and make a lot of money. I have been in a lot of relationships. I’m even still in a relationship right now which has been active for 4 years. It’s not the same. I’m not isolated and I don’t have money problems. I’m not a closeted LGBTQ+ person. I have no real problems in life that justify me feeling like this every moment I’m awake and during my nightmares when I’m asleep.I know exactly what the cause is for me and it’s irreconcilable. My only question is how long do they mean when they say the feeling doesn’t last? Because it’s lasted quite a long bloody time for me personally.

I mean the universe is so large and is still a mystery to me. So how would we know if different timelines exist or not?And if theres another world, timeline whatever then there should be many endings as well. And I've been trying to convince myself that even if i were to kms, which would results in a bad ending. Then there is a happy ending, but its not for ""me"".It would be just like a game, I make choices, and those choices give me an appropriate ending for me. Right now I feel like I'm heading towards a bad ending, but that is simply my fate, so that ""I"" can get the good ending. I'm meant to fail, so that ""I"" can succeed.And you know, most people don't get the good ending in a game on their first try, especially in this game called life. Especially me, I dont make good choices. So whatever that's happening and will happen to me is fate, I cant change it. Perhaps if I can reload into a checkpoint then I can.

1c6zz50;Crippling anxiety;thedadonator;Hello,    Right now I'm sitting (33M), listening to The Teskey Brothers, and crying. I'm crying because I'm going through a very difficult anxiety attack, which prompted me to write this post, which probably won't be seen by many people, but that's okay.    I am an introverted person who has struggled with anxiety all my life, but a year ago my now ex-girlfriend broke up with me after an 8-year relationship. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (and several other disorders) at the same time, and the breakup wasn't because of a lack of love or infidelity, but because she couldn't commit to our relationship until she learned to control her issues, and she didn't want to drag me through that anymore (due to several major life changes, all of it came to the surface). I understand her decision because I won't lie, it was extremely difficult to understand what was happening with us.    It's been a year since all that, but I still haven't recovered, not even close. My anxiety has reached a point where it paralyzes me, I can't even perform the simplest tasks at work, and all I can do is curl up in a ball and wait for it to pass. This phase can last for several days, then I'll be okay. And so it goes on.    I grew up in a happy family, but these things were never talked about, so I never learned how to interpret my emotions, let alone verbalize them. This was one of the issues in the relationship. I went to a psychologist for a few months, but in the end, I felt like we were just going around in circles and I didn't learn how to deal with all of this.

1c6z8ji;Does anyone else feel things, in their brains?;ThisNameIsUnique2;I have this weird thing where I feel pleasure or pain in side my brain, where no such thing should be happening. Right now I was listening to music that I really love and I feel literal tickles in my brain, quite the same way as if someone would gently be tickling me elsewhere, but this is on the inside. Sometimes, if a person says something extremely void of logic or thought, or with an extremely toxic attitude, I feel this strange sensation inside my brain where I am blocking the stupid from getting in and it feels like it is physically exhausting my thoughts the same way as if I were straining a muscle very hard for a very long period of time. Then sometimes if I am in emotional pain, there is pain on the very top of my head, inside my skull. This hasn't happened in a long time.I think the strangest one is feeling the same type of pleasure as sexual pleasure is, but inside my brain and with no sexual connotations. If I am figuring something out that has a lot of pieces, especially if they have been bothering me a long time maybe without me knowing. If I sort it out, I get these braingasms. The music thing, if the music hits somewhere in my mind, a place I have very little understanding of and perhaps difficulty in expressing it verbally, and imagining images or mechanical creations or programming schematics, or stories or anything positive, those are the strongest ways my brain starts to create some what I cant' describe as anything but pleasure juice. My mind has been clearing itself of some serious case of brain fog in the past few years and this is when I have become to really recognize this strange emotion/feeling.Does anyone else have these strong seemingly physical sensations in their brains or some clear emotional pleasure stemming from thought or free thinking?;I have this weird thing where I feel pleasure or pain in side my brain, where no such thing should b;Question;0;1;2024-04-18 09:40:43;2024-04-18;Thursday;09:40:43;1802;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:20.970439
1c6z3zd;Born to suffer;C_omrade;"My entire life has been nothing but expectations. My mom expected me to be perfect, better than her, better than my dad. Those expectations do so much to you. At first I was doing amazing; reading at a college level and constantly being on honor roll. Everyone would make fun of me though. It was the way I acted. I don’t know why I was that way but I just was. They would make fun of me and laugh at me. That didn’t change. My friends hate everything about me. What I eat, how I sleep, what movies and tv shows I liked, what games I liked, what music I enjoyed, how I dressed, how I acted, and even how I didn’t act. I couldn’t even be myself correctly. That stuff would start to get to me. I’d start hating myself. I couldn’t stand any of it either so I started acting different. People like it when I’m not myself. They like when I’m loud, angry, and stupid. When I’m quiet they all think I’m acting weird. I just want to enjoy things. I just want to be happy. I don’t have anything. I feel bad about it. I’m in someone else’s home. Eating their food. Using their utilities. I’m so embarrassed. My s/o loves me. Loves me for who i am. They don’t mind when I’m quiet. Sometimes they hurt me but it’s never on purpose. I love them still because they’re nice to me. Theyre everything I’ve ever wanted. They’re so ambitious. I wish I was. I won’t amount to anything. Sometimes it just feels like it’s inevitable that they’ll leave me because I’m not enough. I’m not good at expressing feelings. When they’re nice to me I like it. It makes me happy. I feel nice. I really love them but I’m not good at expressing it. All I can do is show affection. I’m too much sometimes. I know I am. I can’t help it. I wish I wasn’t so messed up. I wish I was better for them. I’ve tried so hard all my life. But when others do better they get to feel good. I never get to feel good. It’s never good enough. I’m always so tired. I’m so young. Why am I so tired. I wish I could do better. Every mistake I make is highlighted. Everything I do wrong is remembered. I always get made fun of. No one acts like they love me. I’m never appreciated or loved. I wish I was. My parents didn’t even love me enough to stop hating each other. They didn’t even wanna take care of me. I feel lonely. I have nothing. I feel bad about it. I’ve fucked up so many times. I never get my chance to make it better. Everything bad happens to me before I feel like I get to change. Nothing good really happens to me. I wish things were better. I wish people liked me. I wish people loved me for who I am. I hate being different. I want to love the world for how pretty it is. I love art and I think it’s so fun. People make me happy and I love interacting with the good in people. My friends make fun of me when I say stuff like that. I never get to enjoy things. I never get to talk about them. I wish people cared. I wish people would care enough to listen to me. I just want to talk about my favorite things. I just want to share my favorite things with my friends. None of them care though. I’m not that interesting. I’m not that funny. I’m not talented. I’m not attractive. There’s nothing that good about me. The only reason people like me is because it’s not me that they like. It’s always someone else. I just want to be held by my lover. I want nice things said to me. I want to talk about things I like. If I say any of this then it becomes an obligation. So I don’t talk. I don’t say anything. If I say things then I’m scared I’ll be put away. I’m scared people won’t like me anymore. I just wish I could enjoy life. I was condemned to be miserable.

1c6yxmz;I'm not sure what to do.;throw545me849away556;"I started spiraling when a saw a video on TikTok talking about the shooting in Uvalde, TX. I started researching what happened and I grew very angry and disturbed. I began to obsess over it. I would look up graphic photos and videos of the shooting. I have been looking at details of the shooter. I have even begun to research other really bad mass shootings.This is obviously a terrible state of mind to be in. I mean I will go back to the graphic photos and videos and keep watching them. I'm really not sure why. This has been happening the past 2 days. I do have some background with mass shootings, in a way. I live right next to where the Allen, TX shooting occured. I was at work at a mall that was the closest mall to the outlets when the shooting happened. I was working with my best friend when it happened and I asked her to close our store in our mall out of fear there was a second shooter headed to our mall (there were rumors that there was a second shooter at the time; we didn't know all of the details or what was going on). She told me we couldn't close the store so we stayed open. 3 hours after the Allen shooting, 7 miles away from us, a group of teenagers start running and screaming for their lives in our mall, yelling ""shooter!"". This caused my friend and I and a bunch of customers in our store to book it through the back office of our store and hide in a storage closet, not knowing what was going on or if there was an actual shooter. We definitely were not going to stick around and find out; we just heard people running and screaming. We end up leaving the mall through the back hallways and jumping into some random guy's truck telling him to drive. We had none of our things; not even our phones. I had been trampled and fell a couple times, and we were running extremely fast. The whole time this was happening, my friend was freaking out and crying, as were the rest of the customers in the storage room hiding with us. I was COMPLETELY calm. I mean I was in planning mode. I was trying to figure out the best way out of the mall and trying to calm my friend down while she was hysterical. I was terrified of what was happening, but I did not shed a tear. I figured between us we needed one brain to at least get us out of the mall. What made the night worse was my parent's reaction to what happened. I called them using the man from the truck's phone, and neither answered. I had to call another friend of mine to call my brother and tell him what happened. At this point, we did not know it was a hoax. My brother tells my mom ""there's a shooter at (blank) mall"". My mom goes: ""Nah, you're thinking of Allen. It's on the news"". My brother proceeds to have to convince my mom about what was happening at my mall. I recieve no further calls from my brother, mom, or dad, even though I called them multiple times from this same phone number.This is happening to me while my friend's parents are immediately worried about her, wondering where she was and immediately getting in their cars to come to her. Her mom and dad even went out of their way to call the guy in the truck's phone number again to thank him for taking us home. I get home and my dad just starts asking me about the specifics of what happened. He doesn't hug me. Doesn't seem surprised. It's like if I were to ask someone about a movie they saw. He doesn't seem bothered or ask if I'm okay.My mom acted the same way. All she says to me is that she's ""glad I'm okay"". The next day, after I found out it was a hoax, my mom says to me that I couldn't have been traumatized because it wasn't even real.This had me speechless.I went through all of that thinking I was at death's door just for it to NOT be real. My body and mind STILL WENT THROUGH ALL OF THAT. It doesn't matter if it was real or not. We didn't know, and you're not going to hang around to find out when the entire mall is running and screaming bloody murder. To this day, I have trouble talking about or thinking about what happened to my friend and I. We were traumatized, and found out a day later it was some teenagers that decided to play a prank. My mom still says, to this day, that it wasn't real trauma, because there was no real threat.It's coming up on a year since this incident happened. I've been numb lately and thinking of killing myself. I have so many other problems going on, including health problems. I keep thinking of all the things I would miss if I wasn't here anymore, and while that would usually help my thoughts, it doesn't help anymore. I don't care if I would miss it. I have had many other feelings, such as feelings like I don't belong on Earth. I have expressed this before to my dad and he is the only one who understood what I was saying. Even when I'm home, I'm not really ""home"". I am missing a place that doesn't exist here, and I desperately want to get back to wherever it is I'm longing for. This is my primary thought when I feel suicidal.Regarding my recent school shooting research obsession, I find myself getting intrusive thoughts. I have thoughts of what I would do if I was a school shooter, how I would plan it out, what I would do if I was a victim in a shooting, and if the consequences would really be that bad. I have been having a hard time calling these intrusive thoughts, because they happen a lot. I'm also scared that I am a sociopath. I will sometimes treat people very badly and not give a care in the world. I do feel very badly afterwards and usually apologize, but while I'm angry, I do not care about what I'm saying and how it hurts the other person. I couldn't care less. I am scared I will do something terrible out of anger and not realize what I've done until afterwards, or simply not care about the consequences at all. I have a sense of superiority over people and think that I'm special above everyone else. It sounds stupid but this feeling I get where I think I'm special is so ingrained in my being that I find myself thinking these thoughts without questioning them at all. It's how I think all the time and I hardly question them. It's normal for me. Now, I have not seen a psychologist. I wouldn't know what to do if I saw one. There are so many other stories in my life that could show signs of BPD, sociopathy, depression, OCD, and anxiety in me. I believe that OCD could be causing my intrusive thoughts. I've had depression since I was in middle school, and I've had bad anxiety since 2020; mostly health anxiety. BPD and sociopathy is where my understanding of myself gets muddled, as I will thrash out in anger a lot verbally, not caring about the other person's feelings. It's usually to my mom, as we disagree on a LOT of topics. I have suicidal thoughts every single day, multiple times a day. I am scared one day I will just go crazy and hurt someone because I think I'm invincible or superior to others or something. I have a ton of therapy to go to. Some stats: I'm currently on 10mg of Celexa. I've been on it for 4 years. I have an inkling that this could be contributing to my thoughts of suicide. I'm 23 years old.Please someone tell me what this sounds like. I just need advice. I don't have a good support system in my family and I'm too scared to talk to my friends about this because they don't need this drama in their life, and they would be scared of me.

1c6yrty;How to help a friend who doesn't want to talk about it;Leyton2019;"Hi, I have a friend who has been suffering with her mental health over the last few years. She stopped working two years ago and was in therapy. She was more vocal about things 18 months ago, and said she had left work due to the difficulties of working part time and having kids, and admitting some other aspect of her life were tough. She had a particularly emotional job as a psychiatrist and she lost a good friend a few years ago. Since then she went into a very isolated place, I don't really know how to describe it, but interacted minimally in the world around her. The last year she got out of this place and now meets up with friends again, but is a massively  reserved version of herself and she doesn't want to answer the question ""how are you?"" Or talk about the fact that she might still be struggling. When her husband brings it up, she tells him she's not having that conversation. He says they barely speak now and he is just pretending everything is ok for the sake of the children. She's such an outgoing and warm and caring person. I know she would be there in an instant if it were the other way round and I needed support. I just have no idea how to support her. Any suggestions would be very welcome.

I (24F) have major depression and bipolar disorder as well as ptsd and ocd due to trauma years ago.  I have this recurring thought that’s been playing in my mind almost every day for YEARS and I never told anyone because I had no idea how to phrase it- but I’m going to try. Basically, I feel like people around me (mainly family members + my pets) are innocent and naive. I feel like everyone else in the world looks down on my family, and thinks that they’re innocent and can’t understand what’s really going on. They don’t understand how evil I am and that I am a bad person. When they do something nice for me- buy me a gift or even if I go out to dinner with them in public- I feel bad for them. Because they don’t understand the thoughts I have and are limited in their thinking. I feel like them doing something nice for me or even being nice to me is hurting them because they don’t know who I really am. I hate seeing them having fun because it makes me so sad and broken. Not in the sense that I wish I were having fun.. more like, they don’t even know anything. All they know is happiness and I am the opposite. Them having fun pains me because I feel like they’re actually sad deep down. In my mind, The people I love are small, simple minded , innocent and naive and I know everything and am bad. This thought, the best I can explain it anyway, consumes me. I feel horrible, intense guilt that makes me sob all the time. It doesn’t go away.

1c6xxoc;Is this a psychological trait or just my personality? What is the possible reason?;Alone-Category-5245;"Hi every one so first of all i am 20 year old womanI actually feel like I have depression because I can't feel happy. I don't know how people can be happy because of very simple things, to the point that I feel like I'm pretending that I'm normal and that I'm psychologically balanced. Everyone around me seems to be in a good mood for long periods of the day, like their moods and feelings are in line, but as for me, I'm not. I can maintain the same level of motivation and activity. I do not know how to explain this to you, but I feel as if it is easier for me to feel feelings of anger or sadness than happiness. For example, one time I went shopping with my mother in a place that sells makeup, and my mother was interested in purchasing and asking me about... My opinion on the products, but I was standing there with my hands folded, and even though I was 20 years old at the time, I felt like a lost child. Sometimes I feel like women have something.Inside them, where they could take care of material things like makeup or buying clothes, and they felt happy while I didn't feel anything, and I felt like I was acting like I wanted to blend in with others, especially women, but I didn't feel happy from shopping or even going to the malls. There may be days when I can't. Laughing and talking, but I cannot feel happy or happy because you feel like you are an important part or connected to real events. I feel that people are real or very real while I am here and I feel that I am different from them.I feel like a deep-thinking person, depressed and a bit broken down. I don't feel as energized or strong as I want to feel.I also feel that I have strange personality traits. For example, when someone asks me something and repeats it to me, I feel an urgent desire to refuse. Also, on holidays and social occasions, I hide in a room alone and become embarrassed and unsure, even though I have known these people for years. Others develop and shy children change, but I I still resemble my personality when I was a child. I am still hesitant and shy. I am still lazy, imaginative, and sensitive. I don’t know why I don’t change. Why do I lose my motivation quickly when around others, even though I have the intention of changing. Why do I feel as if other women have something feminine and mature, but it has not developed in me? I feel like I am... A pre-pubescent girl I know in my heart that I should not judge myself harshly and that I have beautiful qualities, but I want an explanation. I have a loving family and perhaps overprotective. However, there are no clear reasons related to the environment. Also, when I eat with my brothers in the same meal, I cover my head with a cloth or something like a robe. Because I am ashamed to sit next to others and eat, and I also get nervous about making eye contact even though I can look into the eyes of others. I also feel physically exhausted quickly and have difficulty starting things or developing my social side to the point that I feel stupid most of the time, as if there is some secret I am trying to hide related to With my personality and my depths, for example, when I refer to things that have names and everyone knows their names, such as kitchen tools, dishes, and foods, I name them according to the color or the thing that reminds me of them.Sometimes when I speak, I feel like a child, and others repeat my words to me after me and say, “Oh, you mean this?” “Oh, do you mean that?” Like it's like they're talking to a child and sometimes I feel like other people don't take me seriously maybe because they can see that I don't show confidence and sometimes when I'm walking with people mostly other women I feel like a child like physically I feel like I'm just a follower of them or naive and I don't feel that way. The mature or present feminine feeling. I am also the type of person who is easily surprised by things. For example, if I see someone who looks foreign or is wearing strange clothes, I may turn my head to look, and I may want to follow them with my eyes to see what they are doing, but others seem interested in their personal affairs and not as interested in what is happening around them as they are. Focused on one goal or a clear goal, while I am Like I don't understand how there are people who do not have a desire to attract attention or a twisted desire to make someone feel like they are strange. Like I may be a little strange, but the strangeness of social anxiety, shyness, and lack of self-confidence is not my type that I want to express. It is something beyond my desire. But the weirdness I mean is when other people doubt you or think you're interesting or there's something mysterious about you because you're mysterious and I think that if someone suspected me or even treated me like I was a dangerous person, but not in a contemptuous way, but in a fearful and concerned way, like like I was a mysterious and evil person, that would make me feel fun. It is true, even if I had no real intention of harming others, but experiencing this type of treatment, where others treat you as if you are one of the adults like them and you may have a plan or you may be dangerous, this makes me feel respected. For example, if someone says to me, “I am afraid of you,” or “Please do not hurt me,” or “You are full of yourself or harsh,” I will not say, “No, I am not.” Rather, I will feel happy that at least they do not see me as a lonely or shy child.It sounds like, “You’re scary,” or “You’re making me nervous,” or “Are you stalking me?” Better than ""What's wrong, are you okay?""To the point that I feel like I am dancing on the inside, but on the outside I act calmly like, why do I feel happy about these things?Here is an example: For example, if I and a few people are in a place and it is broadcast that there is a spy, a wanted drug dealer, or a wanted murderer among us, perhaps in the room, and the others will be apprehensive, perhaps I will start making myself look suspicious, with sharp looks, and if the others feel afraid, or they notice me, they start talking about... Because I might be the suspect, I might feel happy, like pleasure, like a dangerous and beautiful lioness  Note: In fact, I am a kind, calm, and sensitive person. I love children and I am affectionate with them despite my talk, so this does not represent all aspects of my personality, but what do you think about the reason? Be honest, but with respect.

1c6xwxs;Repressed memories are driving me insane.;No_digital_footprint;TW-SAI’ve always heard about repressed memories and I always thought that it was so crazy how that could happen. Then one random day things hit me like a trunk and I realized how absolutely devastating it actually is. I wish I could just forget about remembering.  I don’t even know why I did remember, the worst part is that I can’t remember everything. I think something happened but what? What exactly happened? My memory is good, there shouldn’t be random gaps. There’s two. Two gaps. I kind of remember one but just not the details. I can’t remember my exact age or grade but I remember the main things. I remember it was an older boy at school, I remember it was on the playground, I remember the kissing and the touching and how I felt after. The other one is worse. I can’t remember anything. I think it was at a sleepover with my friend, we went to visit someone who I think was her dad or maybe uncle, I remember the outside of his house but nothing after that. I know after that I never went to a sleepover again, if I did I’d always call my mom early to come get me. How am I supposed to even deal with that? Knowing that something MIGHT have happened? If something didn’t happen why can’t I remember and why couldn’t I never go to sleep overs? And if something did happen why can’t I remember? How did no one notice? I can’t get help. I live in a small town and the mental health care is horrible, I’ve tried literally every therapist in the town and none have help, that’s including inpatient treatment. So no matter what I can’t go see a therapist/doctor. I don’t think I could tell my mom either. What am I supposed to say? “Hey I might have been sexually abused when I was little but also maybe not”? Even if I was, what if it wasn’t who I think it was? What if I say I think it was him but it wasn’t and it was a completely different person. I looked it up and it says 30% of repressed memories are fake. It probably is fake. My mind is probably just playing a stupid joke on me. It’s just what if it is real? Why can’t I remember what happened to my own body? It doesn’t even feel like mine right now. I haven’t been eating, I’m barely sleeping, I feel so lazy. I just don’t understand. What do I do?

1c6wo5d;Finally opened up to my parents about how sad I am ;DisastrousVictory294;I moved across the country 3 1/2 years ago. The first in my family to actually leave my hometown. It honestly helped me out with my relationship with both parents, who are divorced. But recently for the first time I finally told them how I truly felt being where I am, and how I wanted to move back to my home state to get in a better head space, be around family and friends, and get my money right, and finish my 8 credits of college that my uncle offered to help me with.For the past 3 1/2 years I’ve been living paycheck to paycheck, barely able to afford groceries. Unpleasant living situations, awful experiences with people I thought were friends, and just pure loneliness at the end of the day no matter how good a day is here. I stopped taking care of myself for a good year 1/2 at my first apartment and worked 10+ hours a day at 2 jobs. And no immediate family until my sister moved in with me back in August (which I thought would change how I felt about being here). I had a job that burnt me out completely that entire time, and just got a new one in Feb in the same field, hoping I’d feel better being around different people doing these things I’d dream of as a kid. Still I’m struggling to find happiness, even though on paper I should “be happy” (minus being broke). I did not want to disappoint my parents so it took me awhile to open up about how I truly felt here. My dad took it extremely well, and he even said he knows I’ve been very stressed out and that coming back for just a little or however long until I figure myself out would be great for me. On the other hand, my emotional immature mom has not only tried to convince me and have others convince me not to leave because “I’m giving up” and “running away from my debts and problems” when I genuinely want to be able to live somewhere I can afford to save money to PAY MY DEBTS! She calls me that same day and has one of her friends try to convince me to stay here as she’s whispering in the background of the call. I immediately blew up because I was so frustrated that the same day I finally open my heart to her she has already told who knows how many people. When I mention my feelings to her, she ALWAYS has to turn it around to be about her and HER feelings. COMPLETELY invalidating the feelings I have, and this time she said “I am just trying to tell you that running away from what you think might be the reason for your deteriorating health isn’t always the answer” and this is the only apology I got from her or an actual response to what’s wrong with me: “I’m sorry you are sad, I am sorry you are broke, I am sorry you have debt and I am sorry the stress is so bad your health has been crappy. But do you think if you leave your debt won’t follow? Your stress might go away and your mental health might stabilize but that’s just part of being a working adult.” I’m just so sick to my stomach over this, because I really wanted both of my parents to understand how hard I have worked to get where I am at this age (I’m v young) and how I have not been the same person for a long time because of how burnt out I am and how unhappy I truly am just being here at this point. I now don’t even want to talk to my mom, or let alone go home again to see her because I’m so tired of everything I feel being compared or turned to be about her. My dad has a new family, and I never get to talk to him like that. So I sit here constantly upset because I don’t have a normal relationship with either of my parents. The only normalcy I had with emotional support are my grandparents, who basically raised us because my mom couldn’t and my dad wouldn’t.

1c6wg7c;Severe Paranoia at night/when startled;kitanathesamurai;Since I was a kid I’ve always been paranoid at night but as a kid being scared of the dark and scared of monsters is pretty normal stuff. It never went away as a kid, I’m scared of supernatural things, ghosts and demons or someone breaking in. I’m scared someone is watching me and sometimes I can’t even bring myself to use the bathroom at night. If I can I sit in the bathroom for around 10 minutes hoping nothing kills me when I leave, either that or I prepare myself to become startled by some random furniture. I’m not scared of the dark anymore but for around the past two years I started seeing weird things when I woke up in the morning, I have a fur blanket on my desk chair and in the morning for some reason it looks grotesque so these days I usually avoid looking at it. Sometimes I’ll see a huge spiderweb over my head when I’m half asleep (I’m not scared of spiders at all, in fact I used to keep one) different decorations will look wrong…unsettling like the flower garland in my room. I don’t know what this could be honestly but it’s always been like this and I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to live on my own if seeing a shadow out of the corner of my eye gives me enough anxiety to bring me to my knees. Any advice would help.;Since I was a kid I’ve always been paranoid at night but as a kid being scared of the dark and scare;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-18 06:25:14;2024-04-18;Thursday;06:25:14;1248;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:21.003059

How can we just sit around when there’s innocent people who spend their whole lives in the midst of war? When people all over the world barely get to experience a moment of peace or joy in their lives? How can we do nothing when our government is taking our tax money and giving it to both sides of a war so they can profit off the slaughter of innocents? How can we accept that even in the supposed “best” countries in the world, people have to live in a constant never ending grind of working tedious unfulfilling jobs? Why are we so willing to accept that our lives do not belong to us? Why are we willing to submit to our masters who only want to use us for their own gain? I don’t understand how we’ve progressed this far socially and technologically and we’re still forced to live as drones. We have more than enough to give everyone a livable, comfortable wage and reasonable hours yet CEOs and politicians just love to horde wealth and expand their empire. The fact that this joke of a life we’ve been forced to live is considered pretty much the best case scenario is fucking pitiful. I think we’re long overdue for a worldwide uprising.

1c6wav5;Nervous System;Ratdickralphbaby;It’s incredible everything we do, say, react to, is all just reactivity to previous experiences. Learning and growing is just slight changes to our nervous systems over time by naturally going through life’s circumstances. We really are so amazing our minds process every bit of information around us using our senses to record so that we can become already more than what we are. That is if we do everything right. We so often do things that damage our systems by reacting the same way to a situation than we have previously in a negative way. We study our own behavior so that we can improve in later similar occasions. Know when you’ve done wrong, and know when you’ve done right. Keep trying and doing new things along the right path and your body and mind will literally change to be the way you believe and want to be. It’s best to literally avoid thinking about anything that can’t in one way or another improve your thoughts and feelings on a certain topic personally individualized to each and every one of us, curated over a lifetime of interpersonal events happening to all of us at all times all at the same time. Some things that happen in life have such a big impact on this process it stunts our growth as people. Repeatedly reacting to any negative situation with the same mindset. Some people think therapy can help tap into whatever core situation caused it but that may only work if we have the memory. Some people can’t remember the event that shocked their nervous system enough to create them to be a certain way. I think fully understanding this concept might be the best way to self healing and growth. Tell your nervous system or mind it’s wrong. They both want to do the right thing but they don’t know what the right thing is unless you tell them what’s wrong.;It’s incredible everything we do, say, react to, is all just reactivity to previous experiences.

1c6vs7m;Do you just need to forget about MH stuff at a certain point?;Professional-Gaijin;"Recently I have been working on mental health stuff almost every single day; meditation, yoga, reading and learning about trauma, journaling, etc. While I definitely feel like I’ve been getting better over these last few weeks, I still wake up feeling super depressed and anxious every single morning. As a result, I spend about 2 hours doing stuff to focus on my mental health in the ways that I’ve mentioned before I actually get up and start the rest of my day. Until now it’s been helpful, and even necessary, for me to do this in order to find the stability throughout my day that I need to do everything else in my life. But recently I feel I like I’m just not getting the same return on investment for all of this stuff. I feel the exact same after an hour of journaling or meditation as I did before, and I feel like, for the most part my day would look pretty much the same if I cut back on all of it. Am I changing? Is this unhealthy? I’m scared that if I stop doing all of this stuff I will back step and slip into some really dangerous states of mind. But also, to be completely honest, I feel pretty okay these days too. Sure, I still get sad, anxious, and angry. But it consumes me less and less as the weeks go by. It’s almost like I feel afraid to feel okay after feeling like losing my mind every day for so long. Is it time to start focusing on mental health stuff less and living my life more?

I’ve been with my psych for about 3 years.   We have never met face to face or even done FaceTime.  I don’t like that but I’m just the patient.  We talk on the phone every few months and she renews my longstanding Rxs, minus some discussions.  I have Medicare now and I have supplemental.  It should be covered 100%. Her billing person thinks I owe hundreds, the doctor mentions it and I explain I’m trying to work through it with billing.  I’m on social security and can’t write a check for hundreds I don’t owe. Anyway my Rxs ran out.  The doc won’t respond to the pharmacy asking for refills, and I’m not going to have another conversation about money.  I don’t have an appt and can’t get one unless I pay the hundreds.   So.  If as it seems she won’t renew anything without payment I’m looking for a new doctor.  but I need meds. Has this happened to anyone? What do you do? I think my county has short term help (like a months worth, which would do it).

(idk how I was 11 and literally knew nothing) but now I'm almost a month away from the end of my sophomore year of highschool and I still cannot for the life of me eat the way I should. I'll eat a few snacks, and sometimes I'll fuck uppppp some food yk but most times I don't eat much. like at all. for the past two days I've eaten nothing but a basket of fries from McDonald's, (my parents got McDonald's because they're just assholes and I didn't want to waste food but I don't support them) a ball of ramen, goldfish, and a bag of chips. while my mother is eating a large bowl of cereal in the morning, a salad and a sandwich for lunch, and whatever my stepdad cooks for dinner. the only reason I think I'm not eating is because when I'm super hungry I feel nauseous and if I eat more that nauseous feeling gets worse, and I have really bad emetophobia so feeling nauseous is the worst for me. but when I'm hungry like that I don't ever want to eat because what if I eat too much and throw up? or what if I throw up anyways my stomach hurts so it might happen. I try to tell myself that I'm just hungry but it's just hard. not to mention I'm getting back into my more depressive moods, I should be taking my anti depressants but I took one a while ago in like December and it gave me really bad heart palpitations (which I later found out was also due to me not eating!!) and the palpitations made me genuinely think I was having a heart attack and I've been too scared to take them ever since.

I wanna gain weight. I wanna be healthy. which is why I'm not sure if I can even say I'm anorexic. most cases of anorexia the person with the disorder doesn't want to gain weight but I do. so idk if I'm just being a pussy who doesn't wanna throw up? or if it's an actual eating disorder. also I apologize for yappin sm I'm just crazy like that 😭😭";so I don't really want to get skinny.

And currently, when I panic, I feel like my reality will warp back to those times.I feel like after I turned 8, they were non-existent. In 2020, my panic attacks began more frequently at school due to social surroundings and the unknown of COVID-19. Then it changed to that I was sick, but I imagined it, and that was not the case.

1c6uwca;I'm watching myself become a worse person in real time;Snake_Hail72;I (19F) have felt I've just dealt with such a shitty series of events lately. I hate admitting I'm struggling because I never want to sit here and play victim. But lately I've made progress in therapy. It's great and all, and I'm finally able to say people have hurt me and it wasn't okay. I blame myself less and am feeling anger for the first time in a long time.But it's making me a worse person.I'm so much angrier now. When I feel myself get angry, I don't take it out on others, but it feels so intense I start huffing and can barely breathe. I scream and cry about how it wasn't fair how I've been treated in my life. I've felt guilt and shame for fucking up in my life and it eats me up inside. But the people who hurt me have never even acknowledged what they did let alone apologize for it. I feel like everyone wants to hurt me. I feel like men have only wanted me sexually, and as a result I notice myself only wanting sex and at times worry about how often I sexualize people in my head. It makes me feel guilty. I flirt with people drunk at parties because I like the attention from men. But then I become afraid when I do get attention because then I worry I wreak of desperation and they only want me for sex, which is something that ends up being self fulfilling because that was all I was looking for because I can't find someone who wants to hold me. Before I used to be walked over all the time. But I also listened to people and made them feel heard. Now I feel emboldened to voice my opinion because I'm tired of not feeling heard or being too passive. But now I'm too aggressive and can be rude and callous. I assume the worst of people. That they want to hurt me. I also can't get out of my black and white thinking. Either I'm all bad and take all the blame in a situation or it's the other person's fault and they're just another person whose harmed me. Sometimes this has led to me not taking criticism well. I've been emotionally abused in the past and I think this a major part of it, especially now that I don't blame myself. Because if I'm ever in the wrong and ever do anything bad, then I'm all bad and I was never abused and everything my abuser said about me was right. I used to be so sweet. So open.

She's coming from a different baseline then I am. She accepts compliments differently.

A longing for closeness, seen as only a stereotypical, selfish need by most of which I do not blame at least that I may give them the benefit of the doubt that they may not express it as I do. The want to heal the hurt with so much passion and giving. I always give it with all of me. I always hold nothing back to heal my hurt. Is it working baby? No, it is working for an orgasm, nothing deeper. Nothing that can heal the hurt, the gash that could turn a stranger’s head and force tears from someone who cares. Tear them apart with what happened to you. The old, Hesperian way has condemned me to punishment. A cage of my own head, my own feelings and uncaring places. Stoic, once emasculated places. I want to be close to her. I want to be held and i want to know the she would care if this beast of burden began to spread its wings and cast a shadow over my eyes.

1c6tl4j;Everybody talks over me and don't really care about what I say.;One_Description8845;"I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts recently, primarily because of my apparent unawareness of my lack of social skills.I've always been the silent guy in every class, usually people approach me, not the other way around, but I never really thought about how bad I'm at expressing what I want to say.I do have friends tho, like 3 different friend circles actually, I really adore alot of them and consider them very close to me, however, I've always feel like people talk over me or don't really pay attention to what I'm saying. Sometimes I'm telling them a story about something that happened to me and they just don't even respond or directly start talking between them about some unrelated topic, I sometimes stop talking to see if they ask me about what I was telling them and it never happens.I also struggle with the perception that people have sometimes over what I say, sometimes I respond to whatever somebody asked me and they tell me I was rude or toxic and I just stand there thinking ""what the fuck did I just say?"" Because in my mind I wasn't being rude at all and I responded something very normal and mundane.I know I'm the problem, it's not an isolated issue with just one group of friends, it's everybody in my life, so I know for sure I'm the problem.I feel like I'm not really bringing anything good or interesting for anybody, I sometimes even feel like some of my loved one's problems would disappear if I straight up died (or never even existed) like my girl best friend who, and I know this for a fact, feels like she can't get a boyfriend because she's kindda stuck with me but also can't be far from each other for very long because we've known each other for so long that it feels weird being apart. Or my mother, who struggles with marital problems with her husband because he can't stand me (and don't get me wrong, he's a great man that I admire and took care of me and my sister, it's just me that is the problem)And I know this sounds like some edgy shit a 15yo would say, but I'm 23 and I'm really not trying to play victim, I'm talking as objectively as I can.On a side note, just so you have a little more context about my life in case you want to form an opinion, I'm a pretty decent looking guy, athletic, I have a pretty good job and I just finished a degree in finances and i never had problems with getting on romantic relationships. (These are usually related to low self esteem and bad mental health).I have what alot of people would think it's a great life that nobody should feel bad about, however I struggle alot with my looks, I'm never satisfied and I feel like I look worse than I did before hitting the gym (even tho it's objectively not true, I can't help but feel like this) I feel like my career is not that good and I should've taken an engineering path and my job it's pretty static (anybody rarely gets promoted even tho the initial pay it's pretty good for a 23yo) and, as previously stated, I feel like I don't bring anything good for anybody and maybe I did at some point but I've fulfilled my purpose in these people's lifes and now I'm just kindda like a burden.I've felt like this for like a year or two, never really had suicidal thoughts until now because I've tried everything to be a better person including therapy, apparently nothing really worked because I keep having the same problems.The catalyst for this whole Bible I just wrote? Yesterday I was hanging out with some friends including my girl best friend, and we were playing a board game, at some point I did something normal that was completely appealing to the rules of the game, and everybody started calling me a cheater, it was so stupid and I was so sure it wasn't against the rules that I initially thought they're were joking but they were actually getting mad at me and started yelling and wouldn't let me explain so I just stood up and left. Later I found a video explaining the rule and showing that I was right and sent it to the group chat, I even apologized for leaving and acting inmature, guess what? Not a soul addressed my massages and they started talking about something unrelated later that night like I didn't even send anything.Ik its a stupid problem, but It was the droplet that spilled the water.It's not like I'm planning to kill myself yet, but I really wouldn't mind if get a hearth attack while asleep.I'm just venting, you're welcome to tell me what do you think of this situation.

1c6tfuv;Navigating social situations as a woman with a deep voice;PsychologicalDot950;Hey everyone!I’m a 25-year-old cisgender, straight female with a deeper than average voice. I’ve been grappling with feelings of anxiety about my voice and am seeking guidance on how to navigate social situations with more confidence. This post will be long, so I’d really appreciate it if you took the time to read through it and offer your thoughts. ❤️I feel very self-conscious about my  because it doesn’t sound traditionally feminine. My voice is quite low-pitched, extending down into the second octave (my lowest note in chest voice is around D#2, and sometimes C2 in the mornings or during the premenstrual phase). As a result, I am frequently involved in situations where well-meaning people address me as “sir” or use he/him/his or they/them/theirs pronouns, ask about my preferred pronouns, or assume I am a transgender woman/gender non-conforming/non-binary individual. 😅I work in the education industry, where I sometimes encounter children who ask if I am a boy or girl (and some outspoken ones who insist that I’m a male even after I disclose my name and biological sex). Additionally, I suspect my job prospects have been negatively affected since employers might feel uncomfortable upon hearing my voice. Despite possessing a competitive degree from a top university, I’ve encountered situations where employers have overlooked my qualifications due to what I suspect is my deep voice. It can feel disheartening, especially on days when I feel and dress femininely, but people’s reactions to my voice can sometimes make me feel odd, or like my femininity is being invalidated. These days, I’ve been looking into singing to expand my range. However, I’ve never taken singing seriously because I struggled to find songs that suit my voice range. I could be wrong, but in classical singing, I might be considered a pure contralto type or a female bass? In other words, I can reach reliable notes in the bass range, but my timbre and vocal weight are feminine due to the anatomical differences between the male and female larynx. (I can PM an audio clip of my voice if you’re curious.)Previously, I’ve looked into voice feminization exercises that transgender women use to feminize their voices. Although it helped me achieve a more feminine voice, I didn’t like how I always had to think about my voice before speaking. These days when I’m in public, I’ve decided to relax my throat and talk more with my default voice, which allows me to focus more on a conversation without thinking so much about my voice. However, speaking with my real voice brings out more of that masculine timbre, which leads to me being misgendered or questioned. Most of the time when I am in public, I worry so much about people’s reactions that I resort to whispering or not speaking much.I’m considering vocal feminization surgery but have doubts because the procedure can sometimes come with chronic side effects, like hoarseness and a limited range. As someone who aspires to learn singing, I don’t think this will be the best choice for me. I still think it would be best to work on embracing my voice instead. I will be consulting an ENT surgeon for voice feminization surgery next week but I’m reluctant to proceed with the actual procedure.With that said, I would love to hear your thoughts on how I can navigate social situations with confidence and learn to embrace my deep voice. If you were me, how would you best respond to people who make comments or ask questions about my voice? I catch myself getting quite flustered when I get misgendered or questioned about my gender identity. I would really appreciate any insight or support you can offer!;Hey everyone!I’m a 25-year-old cisgender, straight female with a deeper than average voice.

1c6st5c;A series of unfortunate events: how life & stress have kicked me down;Bulky_String2729;Hello all, this is my first ever post on this website but I felt it important because I'm at a loss. Although really it is many losses compounded on top of one another.I'm in my mid-20's and in the past 4 months, I've had to move halfway across the country twice. My fiancée and I now live in a place where neither of us know anybody our own age. I witnessed my father pass away. My fiancée have had to deal with her family constantly complaining about our decisions about our wedding. I've had to start my first ever full-time job and study for my board exams and become completely financially independent. My mom doesn't have a ton saved so I can't let her subsidize me. And today, I majorly messed up my first work assignment because I was rushing to get the project done despite my boss not giving me a hard deadline on it.Nothing feels like it can go right for me lately. My fisncee and I both feel so isolated. We have no friends in our new city, and I have a hard time pushing myself to get out of my bed/couch/chair much less the apartment.I had an existential crisis about the fact I'll have to work my life away behind a desk for the rest of my years. I fantasize of romanticized daydreams of running away from it all and living out of a van in Hawaii selling corny t-shirts and knick-knacks. But I know this is just some idealized vision and that lifestyle is not all it's cracked up to be in my mind.Instead, I wallow in self-loathing and a continually lowering self-esteemBetwen moving, death of a loved one, work and my carelessness at it, financial independence, and the compounded stress from it all have done me in.

1c6spwq;Question about depression ;Worth-Technician8958;So I am 17 and people in my classes are in a depression and I don’t understand how they could be depressed at such a young age(They are not my friend and I don’t think they talk about that on a regular basis )For me the way I see it is you are depressed when you don’t want to continue in life anymore because you have made errors or have lived through strong event and feared that you are going to see the same thing again.The point is that at my age, 17, you can’t really have regrets to the point of depression because you start slowly understanding the consequences of your actions when your 12 years old because before that you don’t think about other just think about you.So that just leave the strong event but like besides the death of your immediate family I can’t think of anything strong enoughThanks for reading and hopefully you can help me understand better how they can be depressed.;So I am 17 and people in my classes are in a depression and I don’t understand how they could be dep;Opinion / Thoughts;15;8;2024-04-18 02:47:46;2024-04-18;Thursday;02:47:46;898;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:21.042300

I hate the fact that almost my whole class other than my 3 good friends, throw paper planes at me, yell, throw items, mock me, ask me ironically for my social media..I hate the fact that school fails on being a safe space for people like me. I hate the fact that I have to write two exams today, YES TWO, IN THE SAME DAY in about 4 hours, and I still haven't studied anything because I find it useless! My sleep schedule is messed up. I come back home from school and sleep the whole evening, until i wake up at night and stay awake the whole night, go to school and coming back home to the same mess. I feel like I have already failed class. When you pass 114 missed school hours, you fail class, unless they decide to delete some of them. I have about 160, half of them I skipped because I just dont like school, I hate it in there. I just dont know anymore. Is it even worth to study? Is it even worth to write final exams or even keep going to school until 20th of may if I have probably already failed class? Why doesnt the fucking principal just tell me already and says ""Keep up until the end of the year, thats when we decide if students fail or not"" yet they send me emails of my missed hours and it has passed the limit.  Like just tell me that I have failed so that i stay home in peace for the rest of the school year. The stress of homework, the anxiety I have. I just feel like it takes away ALL of my free time that I could spend drawing or watching a good movie. I havent done any of that in days...I wish I was more free...And I wish I didnt have the stress that I do! I feel embarrassed in front of my teachers when I get in class and they hand me a bad grade.

1c6s8y4;I can't find myself;BeThatOneDude;"This is for myself. Not really seeking advice. As I know I need to see a therapist or at least a professional. I'm currently pretty broke. We do have some free mental health programs locally. So I've been trying to find the courage to go in. I keep making excuses not to. It's been about 2 months of trying to convince myself to go in. Maybe just a cluster vent and thoughts.I'd say about a few months ago my wife noticed that I was much different around my friends than I am with her. This is sometimes common because of different personalities and genders. But it got me thinking. I started to get confused for weeks. Trying to figure out which personality was actually me. The more I thought about it. The more I started to connect some dots. I noticed myself trying to either please certain people or hating on other people. Or being fake to some people, but hating on them behind their backs. A lot of times I can dissociate in situations that feel like I may get triggered and lash out at someone. All my life I've had emotionally abusive people in it. One in particular was physical, emotional, and financially abusive. This maybe a survival skill. If we get something from someone. We may allow some awful things to happen to us. There maybe that fear of abandonment as well in there dependence on the person. I'm not fully sure yet, but the dissociating maybe causing me to bottle up all that hate. Which eventually causes me to explode in anger or slowly be cruel to someone close to me that I feel that can take it. Not sure yet on this one though. I've been called a little boy a few times from these emotionally abusive men. Like why do some grown men paint a picture that ""real men"" are meant to be emotionally abusive. To be aggressive and to act out with aggressive behaviors? They don't stop and think how this will affect any children that watches them act like this? This seems more like toxic masculinity. Which people get confused between TOXIC and NONTOXIC masculinity. The last thing I want to do is emotionally abuse someone. But I find myself some what doing this. I'm not sure what's going on. I need to fix this for myself and everyone involved in my life.I've tried to play the constant nice guy. To always say nice things about others and pretend to be happy. That didn't last long. It's so hard to try and be nice when you can feel people being extremely cruel to me. I never admitted to anyone yet that I'm starting to like little stuffed animals and colorful cute characters. I think I may have always pretended that it was stupid and lame. Telling myself that grown ass men aren't into that.I don't want to mimic other people. I don't want to feel lost. I don't want to be an energy vampire. I don't want this black and white thinking. I don't want to be angry. I don't want to think about suicide. I don't want to think about toxic ways to cope. I don't want hate anyone. I don't want these different personalities. I don't want these constant dramatic mood changes. I definitely don't want to be like my dad. I don't want these mental illnesses. I wish I could just be one person. One set of likes and dislikes. One identity. One personality. One mindset. One soul. One spirit. One set of thoughts. One consistent set of moods, feelings, and emotions. I wish someone would take me by the hand and bring me in to get help.";This is for myself. Not really seeking advice.

1c6r8kh;I dont know what to do with stalkers I have;SpecifiThis-87;"Don't think I'll get any meaningful advice here ,but at least I'll write it. Some mentally ill people stalk me and always try to get around, using info they got about me and my past trauma, chat or sit next to me for their weird purposes, like to ""watch me""  and mostly it's related to their sex life I guess because they called it ""sex"" or whatever about it. To be straight, they hate me out of the blue for absolutely nothing I ever done. Just because. They can attack me in a store or any public place (its usually staff) and say i stole something, threaten to me and do anything to just psychologically abuse and treat me like a shit. And they usually do it only to me.They always saying to me who they see me, it's a ton of unpleasant bullshit and they try to manipulate the narcissistic way to make me believe i am like this. Since they dont do any crimes I can't report them. They can just sit next and STARE or not even stare, just make an impression what they sit near for.Even if I'll be rude to them or say what they do, like to pervs, they don't stop doing this. If I will ignore, it gets only worse too. Just like with narc. But I can't get to safe space because they are all around and it continues in different countries.I'm not sure if they do exactly it to somebody else. But they usually know too much about me when I meet them for the first time. What fascinates me everybody notice it and only laugh at me, like if they are jealous. I honestly don't know what's wrong with others, like do I care, but again I have no idea how to behave when stalkers reach me.I got laughed before A LOT what it's ""because I want sex"" ""beautiful girl"" and such stuff but it's no more then a idea these mentally ill stalkers produce, for those who wants to write it under my post. But it does have something with a trauma I had with narcissistic parents and narcissistic ex. Which is not possible to discuss with any therapist right now because im moving and don't have money as well (or any options, countries im passing never have any theraposts who would help). It only affects the level how I can be more sensitive to any kind of shit people who come and say me the same shit very arrogantly and loud and keep repeating it to break my boundaries. To add, I'm in a very stressful environment and people around me aren't any friendly. And it's impossible for me to get any support because people around are like this, they only laugh at me and agree with these stalkers , typical narcissistic abuse situation. Or they pity me, in the best case. Or they are may be scared to talk to me because they will be threated the same? Online I'm only getting those stalkers again.(why I think they are stalkers? well I don't know anything about them but I was openly stalked (they told me that and proved to scary me, in my country from where im moving, and it was started by my shit family) before by some and these are similar, and whatever, just call them like this because why not) To add, it continues for years or all my life to mean my family.

1c6qrf6;Obsessive thoughts about forgotten memories;Zomkit;"Just posting this to several subreddits to see if anyone else relates to my experience.   For the past few years I've been plagued with obsessive thoughts about forgetting memories and capturing every piece of art I've ever enjoyed.   It usually goes like this: It starts with a trope I remember liking in a movie I've either watched or heard of. For example: ""movies that captured the specific feeling of being outside on a cool summer night"". (The things I get obsessed with finding  aren't easily google-able, which is what makes it so hard to feel like I've actually figured everything out. For example it could be ""cozy movies I watched in elementary school"" or ""claymation titles with a horror scene that other people didn't find scary but I found particularly unnerving"", or ""short films I want to watch with actors that I haven't seen take a big role before"".) Then I'll spend hours if not days googling trailers, reviews, etc. to try to track down all the movies that meet that trope. Eventually I get some catharsis from compiling them all into lists, but the the cycle just repeats again.  This behavior is so obsessive and annoying that it's literally ruining my ability to appreciate new art. I don't know what's going on, but it's extremely hard to talk to other people about this problem I've had because 1) it's so goddamn unique to my own experience, I've never heard of anyone else that goes down these kinds of thought spirals. And 2) I've watched a shit ton of movies, like way more than anyone else I know, so these thoughts pop up a lot more than people usually think. I'll be outside looking at a tire swing, and go ""god, what were all those movies that managed to do a really good tire swing scene?"" and then that's my weekend gone.  But it really is a big problem plaguing my life right now. It's extremely distracting to go down these thought spirals and I'm missing work because of it. It's also ruining my ability to enjoy new and old movies because whenever I watch them I just end up getting distracted by these thoughts that say ""wouldn't you rather track down all the movies you've ever watched that captured the same feeling you're feeling now?""  It goes beyond movies as well. These kinds of thoughts seep into everything I do and experience. I can't experience the present without my brain trying to remember everything that made me happy before.  Thank you for reading, this was extremely cathartic to write. Please someone tell me you can relate to this, or at least explain what I might be going through.";Just posting this to several subreddits to see if anyone else relates to my experience.

1c6qmxa;Tired of my dual life;cherrieblozzomz;I dont have anywhere else to turn to with this because of my intense social anxiety. Talking anonymously is the only way ill feel comfortable sharing this.     I've come to a point where I cannot stand the false identity I've created to protect myself. This ID is used everywhere but home, where I feel the safest. I used to force myself to act like a shy, scraggly, submissive and overly feminine woman beginning in middle school so I could be liked and face no judgement. This got worse in highschool where this role just comes naturally to me with no thought behind it. That is not me. That character is not who I am.      I am not feminine, timid, scraggly, or quiet at home but boisterous, friendly, and assertive. In fact I do not even feel like a woman but that's besides the point. The point is I don't know how to escape this position I've put myself in because now I feel I have to meet the expectations of others who think they know me. This is mostly out of fear and anxiety. I am weak and don't do well against judgement.      Im protecting myself from judgement though this identity by it acting as a barrier to my true self, so people will never be able to know who I am. I do this because I know I'll never be able to meet the needs of most people around me, and I also fear that they'll ask for more of me. I am not against having friends but after years of putting myself down for having no social life I've finally become comfortable with my isolation, in fact I prefer it.      But I really just want to be myself. Living two lives has become tiring and I just want to escape my mind and do the things I want to do without fear. I am so tired. I cannot do anything on my own in social situations because of my overwhelming anxiety and false persona. I need advice and I'm open to anything.

1c6q6q5;I stopped taking my medication.;susiecrow;For background, in late September I was in a bad mental rut and had 2 half hearted suicide attempts. I was sent to a psychiatric ward and was prescribed 20mg of fluoxetine. Since then I haven't really felt like the medication has done all that much but have since pulled myself out of the rut I was once in. Also in all honesty being sent to a hospital again is enough motivation for me to try and take better care of myself. Without my families knowledge, I have began to slowly taper off of my medication for the last 2 weeks I'd say now. I don't want to have to use medication or be dependent on it in the future, it also gave me some mild visual disturbances relating to abuse of hallucinogens. I want to stop taking my medication but at the same time I feel immensely guilty for stopping my medication on my own terms and not considering the lengths my family went to help me. I'm too worried to talk about it with my family, feedback would be immensely appreciated.;For background, in late September I was in a bad mental rut and had 2 half hearted suicide attempts.;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-18 00:41:59;2024-04-18;Thursday;00:41:59;971;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:22.376996
1c6q6gi;I don’t know who I am?;JungerRoemerXx;I 18m basically have no idea who I am, what I like and what direction I wanna take. As a young teen I used to be very goth for like 1 year, suddenly I was punk, then hippie etc. etc. Of course its normal to change interests as a teen and to go through phases but I feel like I never ever had one identity. At 13/14 I started getting severly depressed and that’s where that loss of an identity got even worse. I have been depressed and lonely my whole teenage years. When I turned 16/17 I suddenly started getting into weed, I only surrounded myself with smokers, plugs, wannabe gangsters and all that shit. That was the first „community” where I felt accepted. After a while I developed a cocaine problem, started abusing amphetamines for a while and experimented with a lot of other shit. I feel like all the things I did and that constant dopamine adrenaline lifestyle killed my soul even more. I stopped going to school, I’m severly depressed and every day I have a new personality. One day I’m pagan, like metal and wear band tees - mental breakdown - next day I’m back to tracksuits, drill and agression problems - mental breakdown - suddenly I wanna go back to being christian, wanna stop living in sin and wanna be a good christian boy - mental breakdown - next day I’m into techno, satanism and leftist politics - suddenly conservative - suddenly happy - suddenly depressed yap yap yap. You get it. There is no constant in my life. Of course its normal to like several things but to change everything every day? I don’t fucking think thats normal and it fucking annoys me. Who am I? What do I like? What type of life do I wanna accomplish?? No idea. I don’t even know what my favorite color is.I wanna fall in love one day but how am I supposed to connect with someone deeply when I have new religious, moral, political, music, art etc. Opinions all the time.I just wish I knew what the hell was up and where that problem comes from so I could do something..I’m also in therapy but my therapist constantly cancels so I’m on my own.

1c6q5ck;I don't know man;Electronic_Reward265;Hi, I live in the US and I'm 18/m with adhd and autism, I like to think I'm mostly normal and usually I'm a happy dude but give or take 4 weeks ago now I have been getting depressed randomly throughout the day. I don't have anything to be sad about but half the time I have to struggle not to cry for no reason. I get constant head pressure when this happens and I have a near constant feeling of being uneasy or like on a roller coaster how you feel your chest and stomach drop sometimes. My thoughts naturally dart from one thing to another while I almost always have some song playing in my head on top of it all but when this happens the thoughts move to any and anything stressing me out or that makes me feel worse. I have never felt like this and it is starting to interfere with my school and general ability to live while it is happening because even playing games, something I have done for years and still find very fun usually, I just can't bring myself to even do that. Something even stranger is that at other points in the day I feel completely fine and I mean sometimes I am even absurdly happy for no reason. It is clear to me that I need to talk to someone about this but I am unable to right now for reasons I won't get too deep into but I am newly 18 and can't get a doctor right now. I don't know what to do as I haven't had to deal with my emotions or thoughts like this before and it doesn't help that I suck at describing it all.

1c6oi5v;Annoyed at my therapist ;Lou_Inc;"I'm annoyed at my therapist right now.I saw her again today. I did went the last I think 2 week cause ""I overslept"" and ""didn't hear the alarm""...truth is I was to depressed and did want to go. Felt I don't deserve to go and it doesn't help anyways. But onto why I'm annoyed. We were talking about day hospitals again. This one I visited for a tour doesn't take people outside their own city and I live a bit away from that city. So my mom lookd at other day hospitals around there but they all said they don't take people from outside the city. Which sucks.So I was telling my therapist about that and she said ""why don't you try to go to the one in this town again"" (Background info I went to the one in my town for like 1 or 2 days and then did wanted to anymore. Mostly cause there were only really old people there like 60 or so and I'm 21. They were talking about their grandkids and stuff.)So I was trying to tell my therapist why I don't wanna go there. Cause there are no people my age. I tried to explain to her that if any teenager/young adult needs to go to a day hospital they probably won't go to the one in this town cause the town is very small so their classmates would probably see then and they would get bullied. At least that's what teen me would think cause I was bullied and they would have bullied me more if they would find out I go to a day hospital.So that's what I told my therapist. You know a reason why I don't wanna go there.And all she did was dismiss me and talk over me. Being like ""there's no way they would see them"" believe me they will find out. Cause the hospital is out of the way of big streets and teens would smoke on the back parking space cause no one would see them (below me I saw some smoking there once). And I tried to explain it again and again but it felt like she didn't listen or just didn't care. So then I started crying and just wanted to go home.Sorry for the long rant just needed to get it out(Sorry for any spelling errors English is not my first language)";I'm annoyed at my therapist right now.I saw her again today.

Whenever I try to talk to people, I stutter, I can’t get the words out, I’m awkward, I make people uncomfortable because I don’t know what to say. It just sucks.I do everything to avoid people, because every time I tried to socialize, it was the worst feeling ever. I lied to my friend so I could avoid his birthday party where there were people I didn’t know, I lie to them so I don’t have to hangout with them. People think I’m a jerk, because I never initiate conversations or anything for that matter. I act like it doesn’t bother me, but I’m just lying through my teeth. Of course I would like a relationship, I’d love to. But even when people are romantically interested in me, I reject them, not because I don’t like them, but because I’m scared. Several times it has happened, that someone I liked, liked me back, but I turned them down because I was petrified.I mean this is just as sad as it gets, you get to have people like you and you’re still unable to have a relationship?

So I have really bad depression and also suffer from some real executive disfunction as a part of ADHD. Well, I more or less have been coming in super late to work (as in 45 minutes late) for almost a year now. In the mornings, I feel so completely dead and it really is some of the worst moments of my depression. I also really struggle with the executive dysfunction aspect. I essentially look at my failures to get up and feel like it is impossible to get to work on time. It's almost like I feel like, if I start to get to work on time, I have to commit to it and I know I will fail. My boss and I have worked together for almost 15 years at this point and we are friends as well as coworkers. I'm very grateful for her and how lenient she has been. I of course also feel like shit for sticking her in this position. Well, I am really horrible at accepting help, but she has offered and I have accepted her calling me in the mornings to help me get going.Honestly, I think I need the help to get going. Get some ""wins"" under my belt again.. but fuck do I feel a bit pathetic right now. I actually feel a bit nauseous. I know it's because I honestly have never been helped by someone and am used to being the person that fixes things for everyone else. Regardless though.. I am thankful for my friend/boss; not just for putting up with my lateness for this long, but also for genuinely wanting to help me.

I already am not very confident or extroverted so I usually wait for ppl to approach me to make friends. I know that’s wrong but we digress 😂 in school I wouldn’t say I was popular, my genuine friends were like 3 or four but I was pretty much known by everyone. But I know I was never my friends’ top priority like they were to me. I don’t think I can remember when I was someone’s top priority last. the friendships I make usually never more than two-three years. The friends I made in school, I only talk to one of them on a daily basis now. I still talk to the others but not as much as we used to talk in school. But lately I feel like even the last friendship is dying down hence why I’ve been thinking so much about this. I understand ppl grow apart after school but damn seriously ? Everyone?? Idrk what the exact problem is with me making genuine connections. I’m aware this sounds shallow but I do think I’m a good looking guy, I dress and smell well and overall just present myself in a good manner. So I would assume that would wanna make ppl come approach me. Idk how to judge my personality but I know I’ve got a lot of flaws. I feel like I’ve got too many of them idk which one is causing the problem 😂 I’m not a very confident person, I do deal with a lot of self hatred. However I can be a bit selfish at times and I’ve heard that before. I can be needy. If someone takes too long to reply, or doesn’t do the normal stuff they’d normally do for like a day, I instantly go into freak out mode. I’m quite possessive and jealous. I really do care about the ppl around me so I constantly over think about if I did or said something wrong or hurt them in a way I’m not aware about. I’m not all bad, or at least I think 😭 i love having friends and I genuinely do care for them. I wanna make them smile, give them a good time. I just wanna be their good vibes friend even if it can come at my own cost sometimes.

I avoid problems, getting too close to people, talking about my emotions and generally opening up. I hate confrontation so I also avoid it and rather just thug it out. I’m also extremely scared of intimacy but I’m craving it constantly. I’m always the first one to apologize even if it’s not my fault. But at the same time I am VERY defensive. If someone changes tone or a way of talking to me even in the SLIGHTEST way possible i immediately think I did something wrong and just start freaking out, like I genuinely start crying.I’m also very mean to people in my family, like I take out my anger in my younger brother (16) and I used to that when I was a kid too and my mom often told me I will end up alone cause no one will ever want to deal with me. She told me I was selfish and stuff like that but she wasn’t wrong I was genuinely a little bitch but that hurt me a lot.I also dissociate a lot, it’s like my mind leaves my body.

There is four of us (kids) and since I’m 3rd child I personally think my two older siblings had it worse than me so I should be able to suck it up.

I needed this trip as my suicidal thoughts decided to make a tiny peep back up. I told myself this will help, and this is what I need. In my almost 33 years, I have never had a more fun, or more impactful to my mental health time ever. I reminded myself that I’m allowed to be happy and allowed to let my mental health progress forward. lol. Jokes on me. I forget how much the universe dictates things. I feel like I got kicked in the teeth today. 17+ steps backwards. I don’t even understand. I will not go into details as it’s been a day of tears, a fuck ton of walking, and missing work because of the universe. None of my post makes sense, but I suppose that’s the thing about MH. That sometimes we just can’t make sense of what’s going on, but we have a community of support who may not understand, but can be there for those of us who can’t describe our current pain.

1c6moky;Problems with developing smalltalk;AdJaded9340;I feel that whenever I meet people I don't really know that well (e.g. at a sportsclub) I always resort to the same subjects. Also, I noticed that I developed a habit of talking in a monotone voice, have a neutral facial expression and don't exude a lot of energy when I speak with someone. I think this mainly has to do with my mood and fatigue coming from rumination. This wasn't the case at all before the covid pandemic, so I am pretty sure it is not due to being on the spectrum or something (I have no problems with eye contact for example). I have it more in group than when I am talking one-to-one. I would like to change it because I fear people see me as boring and because it keeps me from making deeper connections with people i meet. Normally, when I am thinking by myself, I have a prettly lively imagination, and when I imagine conversations, I always know what to say, so I don't know why this doesn't translate to real life.

Rather, they used me for their own needs and I never got to be a person. I am trapped with them, serving them, in their orbit and I don't know how to get out. It has taken me years just to realize the magnitude of this (that I am the ""identified patient""). I have a phobia that made me socially isolate completely beginning age 15 and I deteriorated deeper into fear/detachment/desolation. I still have this phobia and no life experiences at age 25. I lost my youth. When I say isolated, I mean rarely left the house or even my room, no friends or family. I did all school remotely and was able to get a bachelor's degree but I have no work experience. I applied to 150 jobs in the past year, with little response, but I don't think I could do them anyway.I quit seeing a therapist after 3 years of making no progress (diagnosed ""CPTSD""), and now I am at a loss.

1c6lwvp;I want to know if I’ve been abused;Correct-Bag-7819;Whenever recalling anything from my (15 years old) childhood my parents use words such as “well cared for” and “loved” to describe my welfare status.And while that may work for anything under 3 years old,as soon as my line of thought begins so do the bad memories.For example being largely ignored at 3 when I was left crying in my house’s door because I didn’t want to go to kindergarten.This is also very much the starting point for my negative social experiences as well.I was getting made fun a lot by other children and even hurt.I shied away from most contact with other kids and,even at that very young age preferred the company of adults and thirsted for their affection.I have memories of my parents(specifically my father) attempting to hit me but I don’t remember them ever doing so.Notably,my sister was born when I was 2 years and 3 months old after which I started wetting my bed(it wasn’t usually a custom).The enuresis stopped when I was seven,naturally,without any professional help.My mother often claims that the reason for their occasional outbursts was my explosive anger.I absolutely raged like driven by a murderous rage since early childhood.But something just about tells me that’s not enough reason.Eventually when I learned to talk back my parents would threaten that,in their absence I will be left at the mercy of strangers,to rape,beat or even kill me.But at this point I wasn’t even scared of death anymore.My stomach just clenched at the thought of rape,and I began to fear it.I took it upon myself to protect myself from such harm even though I was too young to harbour any such ability.As for physical violence I remember being five and screaming that I wanted to die and my dad almost forced my head underwater.Angrily telling me “This is how it feels to die”.Then there’s that one time when I was visiting my relatives (whom I don’t really get along with these days).My uncle came to my older cousin’s house where we were staying and began complaining about my cousin who used to do drugs.Then out of the blue I was being forced into their bathroom by my father and pinned against the bathtub by the neck all while he was telling me that if I ever used drugs he would kill me.Obviously by this point I already had suicidal thoughts,despite having never self harmed or attempted suicide.Later I started getting bullied at school and that’s kinda where everything broke.I skipped lots of classes in 6th grade and that’s how I lost contact with one of my maternal figures,my history teacher who taught me all I know.I was deeply saddened by this,and wish I hadn’t disappointed her like that.My head of year supported me a lot,and I love her to death.I wish we kept more in touch.I also quit karate after 3 years of training under a wise woman who always held my heart and her amazing daughter.I don’t even know if they remember me,but gosh I appreciate their efforts.I’m now in high school and have especially bonded with my maths teacher.lol love her sm but I’m actually kind of afraid to admit it in class.I also really hold a special place in my heart for my biology and history teachers.I’m diagnosed with bipolar,whether type 1 or 2 it is unclear.If anyone can help??Comments are much appreciated.;Whenever recalling anything from my (15 years old) childhood my parents use words such as “well care;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-17 21:34:27;2024-04-17;Wednesday;21:34:27;3235;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:22.451135
1c6lwdz;I am a rape victim and I feel like I tried to rape my ex boyfriend years ago TW: rape;Hefty_Career_5581;Hello! I am sorry if this is long and messy, I have been obsessing over this for a while. Thank you for reading!!When I (f22) was 18 I was with my then boyfriend (at the time 28) at a party with some friends. We got really drunk and had sex in one of the rooms, all was good and consensual and later we wanted to go to sleep. When we went to sleep in one of the rooms I started kissing him and he told me he was tired and we would go to sleep now and I think I kissed him again, maybe going on top of him, trying to seduce him. He told me we would go to sleep now and I think I stopped trying at that point, I hope so. The next day I apologized profusely to him and told him I should have stopped when he told me he was tired and that it really wasn’t okay. He told me I don’t have to apologize and it wasn’t a situation like that. I told him that he had already told me no and I should have stopped, he thanked me for the apology but told me I really shouldn’t worry about it. He told me that I am really aware of his boundaries and he really appreciates it in our relationsship. After that I let it go and we continued our relationsship. This topic has come up again for me like a year ago when I started to talk more about my experience of rape as a teenager and I suddenly remembered this situation with my ex boyfriend and started to completely spiral again. After talking it through with my therapist I decided to ask him how he feels about it and to apologize again. We aren’t friends now but we ended on good terms and I asked him if I could talk with him about ya situation that happened between us that I have been really worried about. When I started to talk about the situation he immediately told me, “oh but (my name) that was nothing, don’t worry about it. He said you were horny and I was tired, you were drunk and annoying but you didn’t do anything bad. You weren’t aggressive or anything in that direction. Thank you for the apology but you have nothing to feel guilty for. “ we talked a bit more and that was it. Obviously I’m not going to contact him again about this. I didn’t hurt him in any way he has made that clear and I believe him and have to let this go.But everytime I start speaking about my own rape in therapy I start feeling immensely guilty about this situation because I just can’t see the difference. I was raped or coerced (I don’t really know what to call it) when I was 15 by a 26 year old guy that I met when I was 14. We had kissed and made out a few times.and one time I went to his place at night. He undressed me and tried to put his duck inside of me and I told him sno and he stopped and told me I am being unfair. We went to sleep. The next day he tried to talk me into having sex with him for hours and I always refused. Being 15 and a virgin I didn’t recognize that he was being manipulative, telling me that I was being prude and that there’s nothing wrong with having sex and that he just want a to make love to me . I always told him notand that I don’t feel ready. At some pint we were kissing and he put my hand on his dick and moved my hand to show me I should masturbate him and I did and he suddenly took me on top of him and put his duck inside of me and started spanking me. I froze in shock and didn’t know what was happening. After some time I came a bit ofusca of my shock and told him I have to pee and went to the bathroom. I was panicking and when I came back to the room I didn’t speak for a while. It took me about 2 years to actually realize what happened with him and that it wasn’t okay. He didn’t hold me down, the was no force or thread involved. I still conside this rape and deal with ptsd and fear of sex to this day because of it . I froze a and had made it clear before that I didn’t want to have sex.And now I just keep thinking about that my boyfriend could have frozen and I could have raped him. He wasn’t harmed but I tried again after he said and just because he wasn’t scared doesn’t mean I didn’t act like my rapist. If I would have been in the position of my boyfriend I think I would have been scared. I don’t know. Or maybe there was enough trust between us and maybe I wouldn’t have been scared. I really don’t know what to think. I know the important thing is that he wasn’t harmed and I am so grateful for that. At some point I had convinced myself that he was completely traumatized by me. I just feel like I acted like a rapist and was lucky that nobody was hurt and it feels wrong that he is telling me I did nothing wrong .Thanks for reading all of this.;Hello!

1c6lujo;Should I work things out with my friend who has BPD and lashed out at me?;Mr-Custard-430;Okay so here’s the thing- I recently had a traumatic event happen with 3 other friends from our friend group and shared with the 4th person in the group who has BPD that I was diagnosed with PTSD due to it. She has been constantly minimizing it because she thinks my experience wasn’t as bad as the others and has said some extremely downright MEAN, HORRIBLE things to me, like that I’m a pathological liar and that I single-handedly broke apart the friend group (which is not true.) I have practically begged her to tell me what specifically is making her upset and how I can fix it, but eventually had to set my boundaries because I realized I am the only one apologizing when I don’t even know what I did wrong. I have noticed the jealousy being an issue for a while, as we have had problems with this in the past. She’s protective of our mutual friend, and through research, I’ve found out that many people with BPD have a “favorite person”. Any time I hang out with said favorite person, she gets upset. Now, I know she has been through A LOT. She has been in and out of mental hospitals recently and in general has had an extremely hard life. I never thought I would get to the point of being so hurt by someone that I didn’t think I could work things out, but she really broke me with the things she has said. Today, her favorite person talked to her and said she was being hurtful towards me. Then I get a text saying “ik i’m not good at talking but i want to try and fix things. i’ve said stuff that i don’t mean and im sorry it’s taken me so long to realize how horrible i’ve been, but i love you and i can’t lose you.”I just can’t tell if this is real or not. I can’t tell if she’ll really be sorry, or if she’ll stop holding some mean ass jealous grudge on me, or whatever. I don’t know if I can ever fully forgive her for treating me the way she has. This all leads me to my question- Should I try to work things out with her? I don’t want to leave her because she had an episode and lashed out at me, but I’m so hurt by the things she’s said that I can’t tell if she was being genuine to me.Advice, support, anything helps.

1c6lrub;Tomorrow I have counseling and I'm freaking out;Eveseawitch;"I've (23F) been struggling with mental health for most of my life but I only started to admit to my close family that I need help year ago. My mum wanted me to try therapy but I wanted to go when I'm ready (which takes me a long time and most of the time I don't feel ""bad enough"" to go). Now when I'm unemployed since January and don't have much money I didn't want to go to therapy with my parents money so I wanted to wait (also wanted to figure out my job situation in the first place). I live with them and I feel like a burden for needing help.I struggle a lot with opening up so talking with therapist always stressed me out even if I need help. I had online counseling for 5 months last year but it will be different in person.So today my mum said ""I messed up and you will probably don't like this"" and she said that she made a phone call to therapist and she scheduled me for tomorrow morning, she didn't expected it to be this soon. She wants me to go, I want to go and I understand why she did it but I wasn't ready and I wanted to do it by myself. I'm terrified of going so soon and I know that I should but I can't. If I knew it was free counseling I would go earlier but I don't want to go like this, right now when I'm not mentally or emotionally prepared.

She made me fill out the assessment sheet determining how severe my depression was. I admitted to having suicidal ideations, and having a plan in the past, and she asked me what it was. I also opened up to her that I’m a nurse and this depression and anxiety was affecting me in my personal and at times professional life. I dumbly lied and  told her that at one point when I worked in my previous job in my hometown I took a vial of insulin and she asked me where I got it from. And here’s the thing— I don’t know what possessed me to say that!! I promise I never did actually take anything, but I thought about it a lot when I was in that really negative headspace. This is where I backtracked from my dumb lie and said I took it from a friend. I’m cringing at this. I felt terrible saying that. Then later we talk and she gains my trust and then she asks me, where do you work? I tell her where i currently work. Then I realize— oh my gosh. They’re a mandated reporter.

1c6lcgs;I believe that I live in a toxic household;;I (20M) believe to be living in a toxic household with my parents, who are in their 60s/70s. They are old and tired. My parents have been helpful throughout the years like during the pandemic and also the past few months, as I have recently graduated from college and am looking to start my career, to no avail, as of writing this.Today I was taking off the winter structure in front of the entrances to the house while one of my parents tried telling me what to do from the sidelines while the other would say the same thing 30 seconds later. I lost it, told them to shut it and let me do it by myself, and sent them to do some work together. As I was taking down the structure for the backdoor, one of the poles hit me straight onto the dome (I'm ok), so I lost it even more, and started insulting my dad (who had built it originally) saying that it wasn't designed by an engineer (because he once worked in a field related to engineering). Just to clarify, it wasn't fastened down properly at the base, the poles weren't held to stay straight up, and there were only some zip ties connected to hooks that were on one side of the deck, so deconstructing it was gonna be its downfall (literally), and it fell on me, a hypersensitive person, on a bad day.Anyway, I always thought I was closer to my father because he seemed the most sane of the two, as I learned my mother has had mental problems for a while now because she has always broken down to frustration or arguments. My dad has told me multiple times that he would leave my mother if he had an opportunity to work elsewhere (he does research in a niche field nowadays). And I don't matter, as I'm starting to become an adult and I'm able to fend for myself, even if I still live with them (shitty economy nowadays).But recently he has taken the heat from my anger, as just the week before I gave him shit for not taking me seriously about wanting to restore their previous car that they have now given me, to its former glory. I mean, the car runs fine, but for a 10+ y/o car, there is better looking/running, and I want to be able to use it for maybe another decade.I've never seen a healthy relationship, as my parents rarely seem to show affection to each other, they don't even sleep in the same room. And that has brought its troubles, as I have constant anxiety about trying to be social, or dating. They've never been supportive of my interests during my youth. I believe the gifts they give me are only to hide the truth about their relationship/fake love. But from my eyes, I see their fatigue. Since my mother's retirement, the only thing I see her do is either cook or sit on the couch reading or watching TV. My dad? He's in front of his computer writing down his research every day, from the time I first come upstairs for breakfast, to when I'm back from my part-time job in the evening, and even late at night.Because of that, I spend most of my time hidden in my room, because I don't believe they're giving me support because of their old-school views, nor are they good role models. Because of that, I've always been inactive physically. All I saw as a kid (and as a teen) was two tired adults watching TV on separate ends of the couch, they rarely ever moved or tried to stay active. So neither did I.I do have to say, the more I write this, the more I'm starting to cry.I was only born because my mother wanted a child before it was too late for her, as she was the only one of her siblings who didn't have kids, and she was in her 40s. While my father already had multiple from a previous marriage (with another toxic woman, according to him). Who have gone and made me their little brother with their love, even if they never were around, as they were adults by the time I was born.I feel like writing this down is helping me let out what's been bottled up for a while.My parents have been the bane of my existence. I've been bullied because of their age, their work (I went to a posh primary school), and their actions that have rubbed off on me, as bad role models. The anxiety from all of this has always been manageable until lately, as watching their relationship has made me anxious about dating, and trying to experience new things because they hardly ever wanted to. They also don't seem to take the stuff I say seriously, especially socio-economic stuff, which for people my age is very stressful. Their love has always been through gifts and what I feel are empty words, and not through actions. And it's too late for them, as I brush them off most of the time and just hide/close up.I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, as it's been conflicting for a while.;I (20M) believe to be living in a toxic household with my parents, who are in their 60s/70s.

1c6kob9;Anxiety preventing me from working full-time/reaching my full potential. What would be the next step?;gidianna;Hi everyone. I don’t know if this is an appropriate place to ask but I thought I might find support here with my burden. I had a very difficult year which emphasized my previously mild anxiety/depression symptoms. My plate was already full (single parent, living in a foreign country by myself with limited support, full time grad-student working part-time but still poor etc.) but I somehow managed until I had numerous stressors including sexual harassment, two deaths in family, serious health issues etc. and I was no longer able to cope. Somehow I made it on the other side and I finally am able to work up to 20 hours a week and somewhat manage my parenting/household duties to my satisfaction as well as maintain my physical and mental health. However, when I become overburdened beyond this level of comfort I start to have physical symptoms of anxiety that then lead me to get nothing done and the cycle continues. I made some decisions recently and I will have to start working full-time temporarily to support myself and I am scared of how I’m going to manage everything. I feel like I’m on such a thin ice already one step away from a breakdown. My therapist suggested medication but I’m hesitant to try it because I do well when my plate isn’t overflowing, yet I still feel I could do so much more if only my anxiety wouldn’t flare in such dramatic ways. My main symptoms are brain fog and inability to concentrate. Does anyone have experience dealing with the same?

1c6j4nw;I have no idea what’s wrong with me;Ilaxilil;"I didn’t talk to anyone outside of my family and a few select friends until I was 18. By that I don’t mean that I simply didn’t have conversations with them. I refused to speak. I only did head nods and gestures. I was diagnosed with selective mutism in 8th grade. When I was 18 I was terrified of graduating high school and felt entirely unprepared for the “real world.” I began self harming and developed an eating disorder. I was involuntarily committed a few times, but was unable to open up to any therapists bc of the selective mutism. I am now 27 and all of these things are no longer active in my life, but I do suffer from OCD and depression. I haven’t been able to get a college degree bc I kept failing entire semester’s worth of classes due to depression. The severity of my OCD varies depending on the amount of stress in my life, but it’s currently pretty bad. In the past I’ve been able to keep it from showing in public but that’s not the case right now. I’m currently unemployed and having trouble with my job search due to these issues. I have trouble making friends due to my isolation in childhood; I have unusual interests and lack social skills/awareness. I also struggle with flashbacks and being triggered in everyday life due to abusive home environment when I was a kid. I feel like there is something inherently wrong with me, like I’m too well to relate to most mentally ill people, but too unwell to function properly in society.";I didn’t talk to anyone outside of my family and a few select friends until I was 18.

1c6izw3;Depression just feels numb atp;FriendshipScary5850;"Im chucking this out there just as a fuck it why not type of thing and to try to wrap my head around what's going on with me. Truth is, at 22, I'm nowhere near where thought I'd be by now.Been battling with depression since was 16. It's been a real rollercoaster, you know? Some days, I'm like, ""Let's end this""' but then chicken out. Weird, right? Can't even tell if it's just how I'm wired or if life's just been hitting me hard from the get-go. But one thing's for sure, I've always had this itch to vanish completely, like off to some deserted island or hiding out in the woods like Walter White. And l'm not picky about how it ends, quick or slow, 'cause deep down, I feel like deserve it. Living feels like a never-ending struggle, yet don't feel like deserve to keep going. I'm so numb these days that I catch myself finding dark humour in my suicidal thoughts. It's messed up, I know, but it's been so long that it's just a part of who am now, shaping every bit of me.I've gotten so used to these thoughts that they're like my default setting. It's like they've become part of my identity, you know? And the thought of not feeling this way scares the hell out of me 'cause it's like, what else have got? No friends, no social life, just me holed up at home for weeks on end. That's been my life for ages now, and I've kinda made peace with it. It's like I'm scared to lose this messed-up part of me that defines who am. Everything I've done has been with this wanna check out"" and ""l'm all alone"" mindset. And hitting 23 soon? That's a wake-up call in itself as I've always had this thought in the back of my head from young that I wouldn't make it passed 24. Usually, l'd be bawling my eyes out thinking like this. But now? Nah, I'm just blank, empty. I'm craving some sort of release, feeling like l'm at the end of my rope. I feel pathetic, like I'm just stumbling through life with no clue where I'm headed.I barely feel like a person anymore. It's been a downward spiral, and can't bring myself to open up about it to anyone. My family's in the dark about it all, and even my girlfriend, bless her heart, only knows bits and pieces 'cause it's tough to deal with these things when you're long distance and honestly recently I feel like I'm just a burden on her and she deserves better. And honestly, I reckon l'd just drain her energy if I let it all out. I doubt anyone gets how deep these thoughts run. Opening up to my parents? That's a can of worms I'm not ready to crack open. And don't even get me started on seeking professional help. That'd slam shut doors l'd never get open again. Graduated uni, but job hunting's been a bust. I thought it'd be my ticket out, a fresh start, but no dice.Sleep's been a joke lately, barely scraping a few hours a night. Always tired, always on the edge of losing it. Ijust want some relief, man. Physically, entally, emotionally, spiritually-I'm just yearning for a way out. I used to be all fit and and cheerful surrounded by mates. Now? I'm just a lonely fat piece of shit and even hitting the gym does bugger all for me. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Feels like this is the end of the road for me.Sorry for rambling on. Just needed to let it all out, you know?

I'm doing this mostly because I need to know if anyone else has feel this way? Since I can remember I feel like I am constantly being watched by a group of people, something similar to big brother (that's how I started called so), like wherever I go, live or just pass by and whatever I do and say they are always following me and watching me. Sometimes I even can hear the conversations they have about me and my decisions and how they judge me. And this has made me to act in consequently to that, since it started to happen I have become less and less talkative, more introvert, i feel embarrassed all the time and I just can't do anything anymore without feeling judge by those people. The other thing is that depending on the day, or how i feel the people change, sometimes is a group compound by members of my family, sometimes by some of the bullies from my highschool, sometimes even by famous people that i like. Since it has been happening for so long I have create some cameraless (that's how I like to call them) spaces, which are basically safes spaces where they are not there, which are usually the toilets or bathrooms. I even only get change there for example. I have been in therapy but honestly I was completely terrified of saying this to any of my past psychologies since I was afraid to end up internal in a psychiatrist or something similar. But I just can't live my life this way anymore, it's so sofocating and hard dealing with them every fucking second of the day.

Then  I THINK I'm not sure when anymore exactly, but I think I hallucinated in my room alone when I was 8 years old.  I thought I saw demons for some moments then it disappeared.  I would also get bullied at school. My 'friends' would just watch it happen and do nothing. They wouldn't hang out with me either so I was isolated. Then I also got sexually assaulted by my sister.Fast forward 6th grade, when I joined a new school I hallucinated for mere seconds I won't get into detail but I said some weird stuff. I hallucinated again for some moments in the 7th grade.The in form 2 at church, it happened again for a couple of moments. I was asking 'for help' , but my church mates didn't believe me.Then  in form 3 some time before covid I had a full on psychotic break for a month. I would see demons ,I would still go to school but I would sometimes bump into walls and say stuff like my church elders sexually abused me. (They didn't)Why didn't I receive help? My family and classmates thought I was pretending. My sister is a medical student she said she asked a psychologist and they said I'm pretending, that I don't need to go seek help.But I still didn't believe that because I do believe I was sick. I have never malingered a day in my life, unless pretending to be sick to avoid school counts eg having a cold or fever. To that I say who hasn't done that before.Fast  forward till now, I managed to get in contact with a psychologist and told them  what happened. They believed me and said that I need to get a consultation with them to  understand what happened. But I don't have the money to go yet, the consultation is expensive. So its so difficult to live with to live with my family  cause I have to deal with turmoil of fighting for myself.

Anyway i could use some advice.For background information I (21F) got cheated on several times by my ex partner around a year ago.Now, i have this incredibly new partner, that really wants the best for me, treats me so nicely and is in general stable, if that makes sense.Here starts the problem. One second I am overly obsessed with them, feeling like the luckiest girl in the world and all i could do is think about them and the very next second I just want to be on my own. Break up and run away. I feel drained and overwhelmed and everything just feels too much. You should’ve seen the face my therapist made after i told her. I was dealing with a lot of stuff from my mom and my ex partner, and i am in therapy for almost 4 years. I feel like all the progress I’ve made just vanished after my ex cheated on me.I don’t know what’s wrong with me, its so difficult to explain, i just wished my brain would let me sort my thoughts for once, but as soon as it’s quiet i can’t figure out, why i feel one second like this and the very next second like that.

1c6grso;I'm almost cured of OCD because of my depression and this shocked my doctors.;throwawayaccount-381;I had severe OCD from when I was a teen. It started off one fine day when I started getting afraid of not washing my hands. It escalated to being a germaphobic, having repetitive behaviours, doing weird things because if I don't do it, I would dye, obsessive and compulsive thoughts. Life started getting extremely hard and got worse when my parents dropped me in the middle of a forest where my college was. It was one of the dirtiest colleges I'd ever seen and I completely lost my mind. I fell into severe depression and things started changing from then. I stopped doing my rituals because I thought if I stopped doing it, I would finally be unalive. I stopped being a germaphobic because I wanted the germs to infect me so that I could to the other side faster. My health anxiety went away because now I did not need a reason to live. Things started getting better when it came to my OCD because now, I started having lesser symptoms. I cannot completely avoid being a germaphobic or stop having rituals because it has always been a part of me but it is extremely rare now. When certain doctors where put to consult me, they were going crazy over my case because apparently they'd never seen anything like it. I was like those complicated riddles no one wishes to have because they're so complicated to manage. It honestly made me feel alone because when they do not have an idea about my illness, no one would understand me. No one would be able to treat me properly. I felt bad but at the same time I was fine with it because my life has always been crap, what's with one more to the list?;I had severe OCD from when I was a teen.

1c6gp0m;Feels like my life has been turned upside down.;Zestyclose_Dig_5048;Hi,I'm a 41M. A few months ago I quit my high paying career due to burn out and wanting to spend more time with my partner at weekends. I got a part-time job with a minimum wage, plenty of flexibility to study and very little accountability.I chose to go back to school and study for an IT cert and it was great. I was finally free to follow my dream of working with computers and I was financially in a position to do so.Then we split up.The one thing I had which nobody could take from me was my work ethic and drive. And I know that it was still the right thing to do as I may never have left that career without her. But I'm lost. I've lost the part of me that I worked so hard for. And now I'm on this journey alone, working in a part time job and living with my parents again.Every day I consider going back to my previous role. But I know that isn't the answer. I need to keep pushing with the studies and stick to the plan.My fears:I'll never meet anyone again as I'm 41 and earning potential likely to be low for a while (that's irrational?).I'll fail and end up back where I started in 5 years.I'll never own a home (we were saving and close) but by the time I'm earning enough I'll be too old.I've massively fucked up.My friends and family support my decision to retrain.I'm currently in counselling for anxiety.I don't know if I can do this alone.Thank you;Hi,I'm a 41M.

1c6gjuc;Please help me;KunGa69;"Honestly, this is gonna sound really weird to everyone, but every time I masturbate my personality and the way I act changes. I've done research to see if I can find an answer but nothing I find helps. This is affecting me mentally as I keep changing each time, and I'm finding it hard to stop.I'll give an example, one day I was really happy and made good jokes, and the next after I masturbated I felt empty and the way I came across was different until I masturbated again, where it either made me happier or emptier. Another thing I notice is that my memory also gets very cloudy after and I find it hard to remember things and retain information. As a student who is studying for their final exams, this is a struggle for me.I believe that this theory started when I was younger. I noticed that the way I acted was different after masturbating and I thought that it was a good thing, thinking that if I didn't act the way I wanted, I could just ""reset"" and try again. This theory has adapted over the years and has become embedded into my mind, and I can't get rid of it.To most people, this sounds completely ridiculous, but for me, it's affecting me mentally in a way that's hard to explain to anyone else.

1c6g3vl;I actually feel so much stress whenever my mom sends me those Christian videos. ;Simpyshrimpydimp;I don't understand it at all. I was usually following others when I was a child and it could be very toxic. My ex best friend who I am talking to occasionally with she is so much better now, was being controlling and mean towards me. I was afraid to stand up for myself. I promised myself that after primary school, I am going to never be with someone who is controlling towards me and toxic. I don't have any school friends even 7 years later. Though I have 2 friends whom I really love. I was rather lonely and being laughed at, at school. But I was building up my personality and grew more confident of myself even though I was really insecure. I finally got a sense of myself with what I like, what my goals are in life and how I am.This is what I learned by having opinions and having a sense of my own thoughts. THATS NOT RIGHT AT ALL! IT'S NOT GOD WORDS AND IT COULD SCREW YOUR LIFE!! EITHER I AM CONTROLLED IF I FOLLOW OTHERS BLINDLY WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OR I FEEL LONELY AND ANXIOUS IF I FOLLOW MY OWN PATH!! I AM ALSO CONTROLLED BY THE MEDIA IF I JUST LIKE SOME OF IT. I know the fine line between fiction and reality. Seriously I read creepypastas. Those are non fictional horror telling stories. But there is a crime case happened because of it and the creepypasta community made a message ''it's creativity not reality'' Because they sympathized with the girl in the crime. And guess what, I loved with what they have done and I do not support people who do bad things. I have a sense with what's wrong and right but my mom who I dearly love wants to change my mindset.

I am not attached to family, friends, or even my pets. I do have empathy, to be honest, a lot of it. If a dog dies in a movie, I will cry. Having difficulty getting attached has allowed me to easily cut people out of my life or sometimes go months or even years without contacting friends and family simply because I lack the urge to. I don't miss the people I cut out or even think about them, and if I do, I have no strong emotional response. I'm only really attached to my ex, and since we broke up, I feel like I have no one, even though I have a lot of people around me.

This makes me lose sleep and also always stay in the dark although I still feel paranoid thinking if I'm still being watched Amidst the darkness somehow. I used to feel this way at times but not like this, I'm a continuous manner. I also used to feel like I'm being talked about or made fun of or something like I'm a useless person and nobody wants me and everyone wants to get rid of me. And I still feel that way. I don't know if this comes under bedding paranoid or not. I also feel like someone's heading what I'm saying too and keeping an eye.

1c6fnkw;I am not a good person;ActiveAmbitious6686;Throughout my life I have spent most of my time coasting through life, not taking anything seriously and most stuff that I am good at just came naturally to me, I don’t work for it. I have been so blessed in my life with overwhelming support from my family. I could do whatever I wanted (within reason) as long as I maintained good grades in school. Instead of working for those grades, I would do anything to get good grades, cheat, lie, take advantage of nice people to get the answers etc. In college I was a leach, I latched onto a few friends who carried me through school. I benefitted from covid-19 online schooling and allowed cheat sheets for exams. All so I could obtain a degree that would look so good and flashy to other people, I thought I was the greatest. I sacrificed a lot of relationships to be able to obtain this degree, it made me miserable working for this, but I thought hey it will just get better at work, not at all.Now that I’m in the real world I’m realizing what a terrible person I am. I started off wanting to be this greater worker do anything for the company, work my ass off for something and do it. I felt like the smartest guy like I knew everything right when I started working there. But after awhile I realized I know nothing. I quickly got burnt out, I thought if something was wrong or off it was my fault or a mistake that I made. Instead of just asking the question and now if anything gets remotely hard I fold like a lawn chair. I don’t ask the appropriate questions in fear of looking dumb and I act like I know everything when I really don’t. The work I’m putting out is terrible and my mindset is terrible when trying to learn. I don’t take teaching/coaching well, it feels like when someone is teaching me something I’m either 1.) too good or know it already or 2.) feel it is a strike at my ego because I don’t know it. I have this weird comparing myself to other people attitude because I am so insecure about myself. I’m overly self aware to my surroundings and how people view me. When just talking to people at work they just give me this blank stare like why tf did we hire this guy. I’ve never been the greatest communicator I fall back on dirty jokes, belittling myself and sports for topics of conversation. In the real world, you can’t talk the way that I do and find comfort in talking about. Which is hard for me to understand and cope with. I never realized how entitled I am until I started this job and realize I have made no personal connections with people. I expect this to be like school where I get gratification in the sense of obtaining a grade for something. But not getting that grade back, getting that high of seeing a good score or seeing that shit score and knowing I need to buckle down has been a tough adjustment. I am realizing that I have serious issues that I need to work on and I have started to go to counseling to help mitigate some of my problems, however I feel like I’m just going in there complaining and not taking any actual action. I have had some dark thoughts about life and I have gone to some dark mental places since starting this job. I know people are going to read this and think what an entitled pos, and you are completely right. I have a supportive family, friends and girlfriend, but I can’t pull myself out of this. I just need some guidance on what I can do to get out of this.

1c6fl46;How to slow down an impending mental breakdown? Or let it happen? ;SMB000752;I (28F) and my fiancé (26F). This may seem like a silly question but I am completely serious. My partner seems to be on the verge of a mental breakdown. I have been trying to get her into a doctor or counselor for months and months and I cannot convince her to get help and at this point she seems to be either days or weeks away from a serious mental breakdown. By breakdown I am referring to serious hospitalization at a minimum and potentially long term hospitalization if needed. She’s been dealing with an extreme amount of stress and has been coping with it very very poorly. I’m not saying this to judge her it’s simply the truth. She’s dealing with chronic pain issues that we are trying to deal with right now but that’s very slow going as well. No amount of talking about it together seems to make any difference long term and things are quickly getting worse. She’s having mini emotional breakdowns daily at this point. I am honestly lost as to what to do now besides support her and take her to the hospital if a full on breakdown happens. I guess my main question is this - is it possible to slow down a mental breakdown or stop it until I can get her help? Or should I simply support her through it and help her pick up the pieces after? I’m so lost and I don’t know how to help her right now. I have bad mental health as well but I am actively being treated and am well managed at this point.

1c6f8hh;I have either become a jealous person or have extreme paranoia due to my ocd.. It's really affecting me and making me feel toxic. ;pinkflowerprincessx;"To keep it short compared to my others posts on this topic (lol) I basically have an extreme fear of either copying someone, even just taking inspo from someone I feel like they'll accuse me of copying them and my new ego also doesn't like to ""copy"" / take inspo from certain people...  Oh and another thing is I plan to start doing x and y, and my brain doesn't want certain people to do it before me... It's super toxic and not how I used to be and idk if that's due to ocd too :(It's to the point if someone mentions something, I feel I can't do or get that thing because they may think that, or maybe I am copying them (even though logically I know I just like this thing) and it's like my brain just associates that thing, or activity with them so it kind of ruins it for me you know? Imagine you're doing your favourite hobby and your brain keeps thinking of someone else because they mentioned that too? Yep, this is what I have to deal with. And it's constant! It's been going on for over a year or so. Last year my ocd was so bad, but I was experiencing a different theme and it kept changing when I got over one thing.. Now this, I fear ill never be able to heal from this :( my brain is in some habit of doing this and it tortures me. I'd really appreciate any advice on this, a reality check (however I am starting to think this is all reassurance seeking??) but I'm also not sure if it's ocd :/ I remember exercising something similar where my brain wouor associate a horrible time to a certain object etc, it was the exact same as this. Maybe that was ocd too...

I'm shaking rn because of a text convo we had and its awful, I feel awful;LyoshaOsgood;She says things almost every day, i support her almost every day, I do everything to support her. Now she kept on and on about ways to commit suicide and made jokes about it. I know that she can do something like than under emotions and I am emotionally drained from supporting her over and over again without receiving it back. Here's what we had after she stopped texting about ways one can commit suicide:Me: It's not funny, not even a bit, it's just fucked up,I do not know what to answer.Gf: Sorry. Well, I'm not thinking about myself at all when I say this. I'm just thinking about situations like this.

And nothing else. Don't take every word I say seriously. It will always be clear when I'm serious and when I'm not. But if I talk about it seriously, then even that won't be serious, because I just won't say it. When I talk about it so openly, it means only one thing. It's all like spitting into the void. And nothing moreI remember telling her one time about the same thoughts. One single fucking time, I hoped for support or just a simple 'it's gonna be okay', but she broke down and then blamed me for even saying this thing, she said: 'you know what reaction I get from these messages, why would you even say it? What was I supposed to say?'. And now when I already told her a few times that talks like that that go one end about her having a monolog is making me scared and shaky.

Ive spent all this time working on myself, trying to change and be a better person. It bugs me. My ex told me how she didnt feel like I reciprocated in the beginning and how it felt one sided. How conversations didnt flow normally with me. And all that kept bugging me. It was because I was closed off from everybody for so long, didnt make friends nor did I bothered to. Was an absolute dick to everybody. Treated people like shit and never shared any personal information with my friends. I think I had forgotten how to. And I hate myself for making my ex feel that way too. I have been working on myself. My issues with communication, making friends, being considerate. I did a lot of self reflection in the past month. Also the mistakes I made, which ultimately led to the breakup. My issues with boundaries and respect. I had to gain them again for myself. Today I got a text from my friend where she thanked me for helping her out and looking after her health. This made me feel genuinely happy. It felt like I actually am helping out people. And it felt so good. I just wanna help everyone in my life and treat everyone with compassion.;Me and my ex broke up a month ago. And yes its very hard to move on.

1c6exkc;44m feeling stuck;Chubbyfun23;I've read posts on here and I thought my life was bad but there's a lot of people here who are doing worse than me. I feel for you all. That being said, I'm still struggling here and don't really have an outlet so I guess I just wanted to vent some. I don't have people I can really talk to. I grew up abused and hated by my family because I'm bisexual, so they're not really in the picture anymore. The relationship I do have with them is only because I reach out them and try. I was kicked out as soon as I was 18 and I moved out of state after attempting to be in the military. I've been here 24 years and they've never called me. All of my friends growing up abandoned me when I came out and I have just not trusted people very much since all that. I have a handful of friends but none of them are like close BFF types, more like acquaintances. I'm 44 now and have grown into a pathetic type of introvert. I don't like being seen by people because I find conversation dreadful and I come across as rude and have been called stuck up by almost everyone. The reality is I'm just horribly uncomfortable and socially awkward.I'm single currently after a 7 year relationship with a guy older than me. He's like worlds smarter than me too and always made me feel dumb, but not intentionally. It's just almost a spectacle to watch someone that much smarter than you. I couldn't keep up. The good times we had together were really good. I'm living with my ex who is now a pretty cold person at times. Most of the time we're friendly but that's not someone I can't really rely on to talk to. We chose to live together because the cost of houses has gone up dramatically as well as interest rates. So it's just cost effective to stay where we are. The house we're in shot up in value too so neither of us can easily buy the other out. I don't have 350k sitting around and neither does he. So I also feel trapped at the moment. I recently lost my job to top it off. I was laid off through no fault of my own. Just the company wasn't doing well. I don't think it will be that hard to find work but it's been a week only so we'll see.My life just feels stuck and I don't know how to fix that. I'm lonely and everything feels so hopeless. I have faith and observe Judaism. I converted to it. But lately that hasn't brought me any comfort either. Watching the world burning and watching people dying all over the place is not helping either. We live in some crazy times and instead of people uniting, we're dividing.Recently I met a really nice girl on here. She reached out to me and wanted to talk, so we talked. And we talked some more and for a while I was becoming happy again but she's gone silent, like you would expect from a redditor. I don't know if I said something wrong or what. She told me she loved me and it took me a long time to say it back because I tend to guard myself. Of course I said it and now she's gone. Now I'm just back to being alone and looking for a way to lift my soul back up. I'm sad all the time. I cry a lot lately. I just don't seem to have any hope. I'm getting older, I thought I'd have a kid or two by now. Of course dating men isn't helping that but I've tried and tried with women and they don't seem to like me. Men beat the door for me and love me madly so it's just easier to date men. But I don't want to date men. I haven't wanted to date men for so long.I know my life isn't horrible and I'm trying to look for ways to remain positive. I'm just not seeing anything. I feel like my life has no meaning or purpose. I have no real impact on anybody and nobody has a real impact on me. If I died today nobody would notice.;I've read posts on here and I thought my life was bad but there's a lot of people here who are doing;Venting;0;4;2024-04-17 16:54:08;2024-04-17;Wednesday;16:54:08;3656;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:44.389421

1c6em2x;Images, sounds, smells take me to places and make me feel emotions that aren’t mine.;dinolight101;I am coming here as a last resort of finding someone who has similar experiences or understanding on what I am experiencing.This is hard to explain, so I will try my best. I have many worlds inside of me and they sometimes confuse me, because what I am experiencing isn’t genuinely the emotions I feel. Something as simple as a smell will send me into images and feelings in my head that I haven’t experienced, so it isn’t Deja Vu. For example if I think about driving past a certain street, I get this feeling of dread, loneliness, pink bedrooms, pina colda, breakups and feeling lost. Or if I am in certain lighting it brings me to this mental place of being in my father’s doorway and I associate it with thanksgiving, Ted Bundy, eerie atmosphere and death. These examples might sound stupid, but they consume my whole life to the point of not knowing if the emotions I feel when I think of these things are real. Sometimes I get scared thinking they are predictions of the future and that’s what scares me a lot. But some parts of these worlds I have also have been experienced before. I am a highly sensitive person if that would help with any explanation. This all started when I was in 7th grade as a coping mechanism to escape my parents arguing. I took myself to these worlds of fields, emergency rooms, brown hallways and drug addiction. But these worlds are not real. Over the years they have continued to grow and grow into multiple different worlds to the point of I barely get the chance to experience MY world because I am so overwhelmed by these false worlds.I am truly growing tired of living this way, sometimes it makes me not even want to hold on anymore, but I will.

1c6dsnm;Not sure what to do ;Jwoodwinstheday;Hey there everyone, the post I’m writing has to deal with a problem that has come up recently. I’ve recently graduated from college, and me and my current partner have just moved into our first apartment together. Our life at home has been going just fine, and we genuinely enjoy our time together. The one issue that bothers me the most is the fact I have no money. I’ve tried to alleviate this by getting a temporary job in the meanwhile while looking for jobs pertaining to my field. However, I know that as some point I’m just going to leave this temporary job because it’s not something I can stand doing. The temporary job is for a political campaign, and I am “canvassing” for it. So in short I go to specific houses of voters and ask them questions about their voting plans. Not to hard in residential neighborhoods, but when we have rural houses my heart is almost beating out of my chest. I don’t feel bad that I get anxiety from this. I feel bad because I don’t always go to houses, and I will just mark them as nobody is home on our app. I’ve had a so-so work ethic my whole life, and it’s something I’ve always felt insecure about. I’ve always felt on edge and extremely tense at every job I’ve ever had.My partner is supportive in trying to find me a job in my field. I’m grateful for them, but I feel like I let them down when I have this work/money issues. I’d like to think once I find something in my field I will start to feel better about myself, but deep down I’m not entirely sure. It makes me feel terrible that I can’t stomach just doing a temporary job to provide for my family. When I see people work somewhere for 30 plus years I genuinely can’t believe it. I’m not sure if all this makes me a bad guy, I’d like to think I try to be a good guy. I’m not sure where to start, but I appreciate you for reading and hope you have a great day.;Hey there everyone, the post I’m writing has to deal with a problem that has come up recently.

1c6dosb;Extreme Homicidal Fantasies ;toothlesstheunknown;!!Additional trigger warning but mentions of extreme violence in fantasies!!I just got out of a conversation with a crisis line worker about this so mini rant/ looking for resources.I've always experienced homicidal and violent fantasies, I've never acted on them- I never so much as raised my voice. Any anger and aggression was kept locked inside.For the past 8 years it's been simple. Just kill them. The who always changed, the how mostly stayed the same. Either stab them to death and cut them open or beat them over the head with a hammer and splatter their brain matter over the walls. In either scenario it's done in the victims sleep, in their own house and bed.Lately though, the past three weeks it's taken a more sadistic route. It would be abducting and keeping them, taking it slow and making sure they're conscious right up until they take their last breath. I'd film it. Cut them open, beat them, anything. I want to be in control. I want them to fear me. I'll film it. I don't think I would distribute the videos. I'd keep them on CDs for my own use. Sometimes there's a sexual aspect to it. Not always though. Lately though it's felt more than a fantasy, it excites me. Raises my pulse, similar to excitement or adrenaline. It causes a groinal response and just a full body reaction.Like it's something I genuinely want to act on. I won't. Any enjoyment wouldn't cancel out the punishment so it would all be for nought. More than anything I just want any sort of advice about why I'm like this and how I can get a better handle on it. I don't know how to seek help out.;!!Additional trigger warning but mentions of extreme violence in fantasies!!I just got out of a conv;Need Support;6;2;2024-04-17 16:04:48;2024-04-17;Wednesday;16:04:48;1587;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:44.447063

So I am desparate to get some advice on how to help somebody that is suffering from a severe anxiety/stress as well as severe OCD that is affecting our life very much on a daily basis and I always feel like there's nothing I can do to help and the helplessness is killing me too at the same time. We thought of online or even in-person private therapy but she had something like that in the past and is quite resistant and feels no therapy will help (I obviously don't agree at all but can't persuade her). What are some other options you could suggest, especially in UK? She is suffering quite a lot (and me along) and other family members explained to her many times that this has ruined a lot of moments/trips/days off etc.What are realistically my options if any have any ideas.

1c6cy06;Bittersweet dreams caused by what I didn’t get while growing up;Independent_Mud_3330;Hope this is not creepy or anythingI am an 18y old female and my father was simply put pretty much a monster (feels wrong to describe his personality and actions here) and I have lived with my mom since I was 8 or 9. I always wish I had a good, kind father or father figure in my life, there is a big hole in my heart and it feels so empty.Whenever I see someone in a show or movie or series, either someone real or a character (always grown men), that I pay extra attention to and get a weird equivalent of what people would call a crush (idk), I never have romantic or sexual thoughts about them. I just get happy seeing them happy and stuff, and they seem so kind and like really wholesome people so in the back of my head I kind of wish they were a father figure in my life.I keep on dreaming about them in non-sexual and non-romantic ways. I simply spend some quality wholesome ”father-daughter time” with them. In those dreams I am either my age or younger, and they may give me piggy back rides, we may joke together, go on trips and adventures together or just eat something together. The kind of kisses I would want from them are forehead kisses, and just friendly hugs.This is not any form of fetish or anything, this is just purely a wholesome dream world in my mind, where they genuinely saw me as family and it is painful waking up from those dreams, not because I am missing out on them but because I get to be purely happy in those dreams and experience the things I have been missing out on, those dreams make me feel whole again and when I wake up it feels extra lonely and empty. I don’t know how to cope with this because I still want to have those kinds of dreams (hope they are not creepy but my mind basically just replaces the made up characters with people I like and look up to). I have very vivid dreams so I can basically cherish them as fictional memories. I kind of mourn them when I am awake. I know I will never have a father figure in my life because my mom isn’t interested in having any partners anymore and no man in my entire living family tree is even close to a good person.I have absolutely no idea how to cope with the emptiness, and that is my biggest struggle. Everytime I see happy healthy families in reality or fiction I feel sad, a bit jealous and empty, and I mourn the things I didn’t have. I don’t want to just move on with life and accept that I don’t have any father figure and can be strong without it. I just want to go back in time but in an alternative reality, where I can have a happy family. This hole feels like it will bever fill and I will permanently be affected by it.;Hope this is not creepy or anythingI am an 18y old female and my father was simply put pretty much a;Venting;0;1;2024-04-17 15:35:21;2024-04-17;Wednesday;15:35:21;2631;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:23.589892
1c6cxge;Something good happened, and I might hate it?;Substantial-Spend-67;"Hi. I guess I'm coming here because I genuinely have no idea what to do. I have a best friend I could talk to, yes, but I struggle with feeling like a burden and would rather not turn to anyone specific about things, but I need to get this off my chest, even if it gets ignored.(Note: oh, man, I just finished writing this and I didn't think it would end up being so long. Nor did I think I'd end up asking for advice at the end. I guess that's what happens when you finally open the floodgates, ahaha.)I've never had an easy life when it comes to mental health in particular. I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 8 and it just got worse from there with more diagnosis being added. There's a lot that's happened and lot that's going south right now (I wish I could say what but they're different serious things and I don't even know if I can add multiple tags/flairs to a post - I'm quite new to this, ahaha) and I've been keeping it bottled in because I don't want to bother anyone. As a result, things upstairs have been getting bad again. To the point where I ended up resorting to harming myself yesterday for the first time in 5 years. I feel so guilty and pathetic about it, but I still feel like doing it again today. I don't want to, though, so I'm hoping this helps somehow. I think another thing that's weighing on me right now is my relationship?For context, I'm 24(f) and this is the first person I've ever let in like this. I haven't had my first kiss yet, haven't held hands with a boy, gone on a date, nothing. I have a LOT of childhood trauma surrounding men, so even though I'm constantly being hit on and the opportunity to go out with someone or even just kiss them has always been there, I've just always had a very specific idea of how I wanted to feel when I was with someone and nobody's ever given me that (this is something I could always pick up on from just that early talking phase, as well as seeing how they interact with other people etc.) and so I've never been willing to settle.When I was about 16, I started becoming very desperate to find someone who treated me how I wanted to be treated and made me feel how I wanted to feel. I was really into manifestation and all that at this time and had manifested little things for myself here and there, but then I decided to go big and try to manifest a partner. I had no real person in my mind, by the way. I just wrote down EVERYTHING I was looking for. From his height, to how they react in certain situations, to the relationship they have with their family, and everything in between. A year went by, two years, three, and still nothing. So, I eventually forgot about that list and went on with life. Fast forward to 2023 and I joined a music group chat for a genre I really liked but didn't know anyone else who did. I figured it'd be a way for me to make acquaintances or even friends with this similar interest. I introduced myself in the group and a few hours later, someone sent me a private message basically being like ""Hey, I noticed that we're the same age. Would you be opposed to being friends online?"" I said no and introduced myself. He told me his name and recommended a show I should watch (the conversation in the group was about shows everyone was watching and I'd mentioned that I was looking for something new because I'd just finished one). This was in August, by the way. We'd mainly just communicate in the group from there, but would private message each other recommendations and stuff very sporadically. It wasn't until September where our conversations started to become actual conversations that were not only fun and flowed seemlessly but got quite deep, too. Come November, I had caught some serious feelings. He's as close to perfect as perfect can get, I think. So much so that a few weeks ago, I remembered that list and realised that he ticks every single box on it. From his height (to the last decimal), all the way to how he speaks to me, how he treats others, the music he listens to, and everything in between. The only problem is me.He knows I struggle with mental health and is not only very accepting of me anyway, but he's also incredibly understanding, supportive, and most importantly, patient and open with me. However, over the last week or two of this episode getting worse, I'm finding myself wanting to do things to push him away. I'm finding myself being upset about things I shouldn't be upset about, but I obviously won't tell him this because he hasn't done anything wrong and I'm probably just being crazy and unstable right now. He's so genuinely good, I'll never understand why he's with me. He deserves so much better than someone who isn't at all attractive and has so much baggage. He deserves peace, in everything. Yet, he's here and he's not showing any signs of wanting to leave, but I'm still tempted to push him away even though I know it'll hurt me too. I don't know why this is happening honestly, but it's upsetting me because one part of me wants to ""set him free"" so to speak, but another part of me really doesn't want to mess this up at all because he makes me so happy. Am I selfish for not letting him go just because I'm happy with him, even though I know that dealing with me when I get like this isn't the easiest? Am I maybe just scared of something good happening to me because I've never believed that I deserve anything good at all? What do I do? What CAN I do? I feel like I'm just sitting in the centre of a tornado in my mind and I don't know how to get out, especially where this relationship is concerned.";Hi.

1c6ctpf;Feeling empty, insecure and desperate ;pastelflowerss;Some background first: I‘m 18F, have a good connection with my family and two friends whom I‘m not sure I can actually call friends. I don’t know how this could trigger my feelings or if it was the reason, but I watched today a historical romance series. I know, series and movies aren’t reality. But somehow, after I closed my laptop and kind of came back to reality, I started feeling so empty and almost nostalgic? I don’t know how to describe it. And I suddenly had this increased feeling of insecurity. I’ve always been very insecure about my height, since I was bullied in first grade. I‘m only 4‘9ft / 1,45m tall and I really hate it. The fact, that I can’t actually change anything about it just makes it even worse. I want to just be average height or at least a bit taller. It’s such a struggle to be this short. Think shopping for clothes. I just don’t feel pretty being so short. I feel like everyone just sees me as a little dwarf and it frustrates me incredibly. I‘ve also never had a boyfriend before and I feel like it could actually be because of my height. I don’t think I‘m ugly, but my height makes me very insecure. I’ve tried to accept it and there’s days where I‘m less insecure about it. But I wished so bad that I was at least a tiny bit taller. Just wanted to rant here about my feelings and get some clarity. Please don’t lie to me and be extra nice, just to comfort me.

1c6cgxd;I'm (31M) obsessed with best friend (28M) from 15 years ago and it's so depressing - should I end it or try to make the best of it?;pt92_01;Let me take you back to 2009. I was 16 and had no real friends through my teenage years. Through church I became friends with a guy three years younger than me. Let's call him Mike. Over that year we spent a lot of our time together and became best friends. I had been very depressed and lonely before this and was just so happy to have a real friend.  After about a year, Mike began to want to spend more time with other friends too. Which of course makes total sense ... but me being a lonely and immature 17 year old took this as rejection. And I started to become obsessed. Any spare time I had I was wondering what he was doing right at that moment. Who h e would be hanging out with and having fun without me? I guess I just had really intense FOMO. We were still very close friends, but when I wasn't around him I was always pining for him.  After another 4 years or so (2015), my mental health problems and general negative attitude led to Mike ghosting me completely. This was a horrible time for me. It took about a year before I really functioned again properly. And I was back to having zero friends, and being very depressed and lonely. But gradually I stopped thinking about him so much.  Then three years later (2018) he reached out to me, and we began to again hang out on a very sporadic basis (like 3 or 4 times a year). While this was awesome, it also revived all those feelings of pining for him, and just feeling not satisfied with the amount of time we spent together and wanting a closer relationship again.  We've continued on this basis ever since. I now see him once or twice a year at most. And then we only meet for about an hour for a coffee or something. And it's just so hard, because after all these years he's still my only friend, and I feel like I just want a much closer relationship, and it makes me so sad that it isn't like that and there's seemingly nothing I can do about it. Mike is now married but I know he still has other friends he sees more than me. So I'm always feeling a bit put out, and wondering if he really even likes me anymore or just meets me because he sort of pities me.  So my question is ... what on earth should I do here? After all these years, the feelings of longing for a closer friendship are clearly not going to go away. Would it be better to cease contact altogether and try to forget about him? I'm not even sure if it's possible but the feelings of pining are so intense I don't know how to live with it.    Some further info. I'm asexual so I've always been single and am always likely to be, which obviously doesn't help with loneliness. I've never been able to make other friends - for some reason I just don't click with people. I suspect I may be on the spectrum but really bot sure. It may sound like I'm in love with Mike. And like, maybe I am? I don't know what love feels like? My pining is very specifically for him and not just for friendship in general.;Let me take you back to 2009.

I’m reaching out because I’m in the midst of rolling out something pretty exciting—something born from my own tough ride through the challenges of mental health. My therapist used to say, “I don’t believe in solutions, I believe in understanding,” this has pointed me in the following direction:  There’s a glaring gap in how hope is communicated in mental health care, and I think we can start to bridge that gap together. We're building a platform to showcase real stories of mental health success and recovery. And by success, we mean any positive change—no victory is too small.  We're aiming to populate this space with stories that beam out hope to those who need it most. And we’re pairing these stories with groundbreaking web design to ensure each story is as captivating as it is hopeful.  I know projects like this often come with their own agendas, but we’re staying true to the heart of each narrative. We want these stories to be authentically yours.  We're starting small but dreaming big, hoping to grow this into a vibrant community where you can find stories that resonate with your own experiences and challenges.  If you've experienced a positive shift in your life that could light up someone else’s path, or know someone whose story could spark hope, I’d love to hear from you. We’re planning to launch soon and would be thrilled to feature your story.  Can’t wait to connect with you and share in your journey. Much love and looking forward to your comments or DM's!

1c6bbm2;scared of being alone and always bored- how can i (19F) fix it and find myself?;polarizedrose;I grew up lonely, without friends or anyone who I was really close to, and my family was not helpful, so I spent all my time bored and distracted myself with media or obsessing over crushes and other people because it distracted me from my own loneliness and boredom. My entire life, the media has taught me that when I find the “one” all my problems would go away and that I would always have them and I would never feel lonely or bored ever again. I also blamed my constant loneliness and boredom on not having any friends (other than online friends) and I thought everything would go away once I solved those two issues.I did it. I found the one. They are everything I’ve ever wanted and more. I have a group of amazing wonderful friends who care about me and love spending time with me, and vice versa. But my OCD, anxiety and fear of loneliness is ruining it for me. Every time i’m with my partner, instead of enjoying my time being loved and cared for and giving the same energy back, I get insecure and scared that they will leave me and stop loving me and I become extremely anxious and have OCD attacks and it’s ruining our relationship.My partner and a very close friend of ours talked to me and we agreed that the best course of action would be for us to take a break so that I could find myself and learn how to be ok with being alone.That’s the problem. I don’t know how. None of the media I used to distract myself with is working and I don’t have the mental energy to consume new media. I have no hobbies, and I don’t have money to really engage or learn anything new. I can’t drive, and my parents are very controlling and so I don’t get a lot of freedom and independence at home. I’ve been in therapy, and it doesn’t work. Maybe I just haven’t found the right therapist but I can’t find someone who understands me. I am neurodivergent (autistic and possibly have ADHD) and diagnosed with severe OCD, anxiety and depression. I don’t know what to do with myself or where to start.All day every day I want to do nothing but surround myself with others or sleep the day away so that I don’t have to face the reality and boredom of being alone.How can I fix this?

1c6alh4;What is the sense of life ?;Die_Fette_Ratte;I don't know how to start... So I just start. Hi my name is Nevio, 18 years old and I Live in Germany. I had a weird childhood. My mom consumed alcohol the whole time, my brother's had their own problems. They consumed a lot of drugs. I was lonely all the time so I tried to pass the time online. I didn't went to school for a long time like 4 years. I could handle it that my mom is slowly killing her self. I was scared to go to school cause I thought that I would find her dead. I developed a anxiety against other people. So I stood home. As you can guess it wasn't fun to live anymore and I began to think about killing my self. I started to hurt my self. I a lot of scars on my left arm. Looks like if been hit from a granade or something.I took care of her while I was home. Like an unemployed nurse. I didn't knew what I was doing but I cleaned and changed her drainage to release water coming from her liver or something. But it got worse. I accepted it. I knew she would pass away. I tried to go back to school. Wasn't easy but I succeeded. She was often in the hospital. So I lived basically alone with 16. One night she had something like delirium. She didn't recognized me. I wasn't her child anymore. That was the painfullest moment I've ever had. She didn't woke up again for 4-5 days. Meanwhile my mom moved to a Palliative care facility. It was Monday when she moved there. I was now at my sister's home and lived there. My mom was there for 7 days. We all waited there for the moment. On Thursday she woke up like nothing happened. We talked with her and played uno and romey with her. I thought she would recover. It was Friday when she got home. My sister and my brother renovated the flat. She was so happy. It was very beautiful. That was the last time I saw her smile. She had now been given a nursing bed to wait for the moment. As you can guess it got worse from day to day. I stood home. Didn't went to school for a time. My sister wasn't at home with us, she slept together with my brother at my mom's place. We know it would happen any moment now. It was the worst time of my life. I visited her everyday in hope to talk once more with her. But it was already to late. She didn't recognized me again. She asked me, her loved son, who I am. I was shocked. I tried to cover my pain with a smile. She had a lot of pain. The nurse gave her morphine against her pain. The nurse told us, when you give a person in that rhythm morphine then it's there to proceed the death. I could handle it. The way my mother is lying there, helpless. I knew it would happen this night.I gave her one last kiss, said that I love her and told her that we will meet again. I begged my sister to call me when she gone.I went home. The next day I woke up early like 6am. I received a phone call. It was my sister. I happened. I went there as fast as I can. I couldn't believe that she's gone. I had some weird thoughts. I didn't want to think about that but I was thinking to jump on the Railway track. I couldn't handle it till today. The time passes like crazy. One year later I told my sister that I'm gay and that I have a boyfriend and the thoughts were almost gone. In the last few days it came back. The self harm and suicide thoughts. I don't know why but I think it was because of him. He's breaking my heart and I can't handle the feelings. I thought to end it. I don't know what I should do. Today was one of that days where I was thinking about it. I need an advise. How should I handle. It was a very long text. Basically the last 2 years. Thank you for reading.

1c6alcy;Things starts to get weirder;ChargeFox;As the title says, everything seems to go downhill for me. And I'll give how all this has started.It all started when I reached 13 years old and im going to give you a note, It's not the best year of school me unfortunately and it lasted 1 or probably 2 years but since covid hit at year 2, i wouldn't really count it.So first off, everyday before i got to school, i had to wake up at 4:00 A.M and follow my mother to her school (since she is also a teacher) and also since school buses wouldn't want to take me from home  due to the fact that our road is too small. But the thing that icks me the most is not waking up, but rather waiting for a whole 7 hours, inside a car without any cooling.Everything felt pretty good and usual at first, but after 3-4 months of doing it everyday, it's starting to get to me. The heat from just inside the car even when i opened the car doors and windows is just extremely hot. Everytime i got to school im already drenched in sweat, itchy, annoyed, stressed and tired. Plus, my friends always tried to ask me to do things and if not, they will try to annoy me by saying im weak. That's not all, because im mentally in a bad mood on that year, everything seems to make me extremely angry.My bad mood during that year actually made me do some risky choices, like i accidently got mad at my friend and i always think that all people around me are just trying to disturb me and the Worst part is, i can't controll it. This behaviour of thinking made me some potential enemies and even my bullies starts to disturb me more.Fast fowards today, I still feel that im there's something stuck inside me during that situation. I don't know if it's trauma or anything but how did i get it? It's supposed to not be as bad as it is. Today, me and my friend aren't that close as we used to be anymore. There's just something off about him. He seems to be sometimes pushy and gets angry quite easily.I think maybe im overreacting, but my mental health isn't improving either. Start seeing things and the voices in my head tries to bring me down everytime im not in the mood, and it won't shut up.

1c6aa1s;Am I experiencing paranoia or is it just regular overthinking?;nuvolettt;Throwaway because I’m a bit embarrassed.(Almost) every time I experience even the smallest inconvenience, I get extremely stressed and start worrying that things will go worse. I get paranoid and start imagining scenarios where bad things happen or have happened.I don’t understand if it’s normal or not.I’ll give you a couple examples:- my period is currently a week late. I haven’t had sex in years so I can’t be pregnant. but I’m getting paranoid that maybe I am. how? somehow my brain is convinced that maybe I got SA’d and I don’t remember it. I’ve NEVER been SA’d so I don’t know where this is coming from. I’m thinking about buying a pregnancy test just to make sure because I’ve been so anxious for the past week and I keep worrying about it. It’s not the first time this happens. I had the same thoughts last year and then eventually my period came and I forgot about it.- a bit of context but I’ll try to keep it short: when I was 18 I briefly dated a guy. He broke up with me because his ex made up some (fake) rumors about me kissing someone else at a party, just so they could get back together. I later started dating my now ex-bf and I was very scared it would happen again. I would think about this scenario every day, so I started taking “precautions”. Since his ex lived in the same city as me, I was scared that if she saw me she could make up some lies about what I was doing. So I stopped hanging out alone in the city unless it was absolutely necessary. If I had to, I’d use hidden and less crowded streets and I’d religiously wear my mask (it was during COVID) so nobody could recognize me. I would also document where I was at any moment by taking a random pic (so the time stamp would show exactly where I was and when). I would do it like every couple of hours or so. Mind you, my ex never asked for this. It was all my doing. It went on for a year.Usually when the issue that’s stressing me out gets resolved, these thoughts go away on their own. But if a new problem arises, I get new ones.I went to therapy for a year but it didn’t help. My therapist would often forget things I told her during previous therapy sessions, so maybe she just wasn’t a good therapist, I don’t know. I do not have hallucinations and I am aware that these thoughts are crazy and that I shouldn’t listen to them, but still I can’t get them out of my head.I just want to know if anyone else has experienced something similar and if I should seek help.;Throwaway because I’m a bit embarrassed.(Almost) every time I experience even the smallest inconveni;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-17 13:45:22;2024-04-17;Wednesday;13:45:22;2456;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:23.612239

She told me some of hers about how she did adulterer several times and how she had thoughts about killing her husband. I figured she was being honest with me and so I should be honest with her. I’ve known her for over ten years. I told her that I had an attraction to teenage girls. She assumed that I meant 18-19 and I didn’t try to correct her. I took her thinking that as a hint that she couldn’t handle the actual truth. However I’m scared because I feel like I should have never told her anything. If she realizes what I was talking about she can spread the word and then my life will be ruined. I’ve never touched a teenage girl or any child. I don’t plan to. I don’t know why I shared that with her. Should I try and talk to her again or something? I feel paranoid.;For years I’d been struggling with an attraction to teenage girls.

1c69e5j;I think I’m Depressed but I’m not sad (M, 21);Brilliant-Dress-3364;I’ve experienced the “typical” depression before, where I’ve felt super sad, discouraged, overwhelmed, and overall depressed. But within the last 6-8 months I think I’ve been in another depression without actually feeling “depressed”. Obviously there are bad days and good days just like anybody, and overall I feel like I’m in a good happy mood, I’ve been able to find faith in God and figure out my own beliefs the last couple years, and I would say I’m really good at being spiritual and grateful for what I have and taking time out of my day to acknowledge my blessings. I live alone but I love living alone, I have a couple friends that I can always rely on that have been my friends for 7+ years, and my relationship with my family is better than it’s ever been.The reason I think I’ve been depressed though is because I just don’t care about much anymore, I used to be huge into the gym to the point where I was basically bodybuilding, got really big and lean and I loved every part of it, the training, the dieting, tracking calories, and I did all that for years straight. But I don’t even care to go to the gym anymore, I don’t care about my calorie intake, and I’ve only been in the gym maybe 5 days in the last 30 days (Im 6’ 1” used to be 225 lbs but now I’m 195ish) and my family has even noticed my weight change and commented on it. It’s so weird to me because it was my life and all of a sudden I don’t care at all about it.I’ve been dating a girl for over a year, but the last 5 months I genuinely haven’t given a fuck about her. I don’t care to hangout with her, I just don’t talk to her anymore, I just don’t care. It always seems like I’d rather just smoke weed and sit on my phone (I’ve been smoking for the last 4 years so that hasn’t changed)But I overall just don’t care or have passion into self growth or actually going and doing anything, but I’m always having fun with myself and in a good mood, but feel guilty for not improving, and I feel like I’m becoming a loser but It doesnt bother me enough to do anything about it.I could go into more detail but I’ve anyone knows what this is like or can relate, let me know if there is something I can do.

1c68seb;What should I do to get an official evaluation for ADD/ADHD, Autism, and EFD?;SeawardFriend;I have been attending counseling for over a year now, and during that process, it was discovered that I have depression and most likely ADD/ADHD without hyperactivity. However, I have only been officially diagnosed with depression and have been on medication, but it doesn't seem to have made a significant difference.Recently, I had a major argument with my parents, and they want me to get tested for ADHD. I believe I have it, as I exhibit multiple symptoms. But I also think there is more to it. I suspect that I may be autistic, as I struggle with social skills, experience unmanageable anxiety, and have certain over-sensitivities to tastes and smells. Additionally, I am confident that I have Executive Function Disorder (EFD), which seems to be the root of most of my issues. I find it challenging to understand how or why certain things need to be done, and I don't take pleasure in things that others find enjoyable.I have taken some online tests, which I understand are not conclusive, but they suggest that I might be somewhere on the spectrum, and I can relate to the EFD prompts as if they were made for me. Although I have ADHD symptoms, I think they would be almost unnoticeable if I could find a way to manage these other issues. The same goes for my depression, which stems from my reluctance to change or improve anything about my life as well as my incompetence towards social situations.Should I talk to my counselor about this? Maybe my Doctor would give better recommendations? Any advice would be appreciated!;I have been attending counseling for over a year now, and during that process, it was discovered tha;Question;2;1;2024-04-17 12:40:25;2024-04-17;Wednesday;12:40:25;1533;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:23.657966

I knew everything was wrong when she just pulled me aside one night and wrote on a piece of paper that my dad was going to force me to do gay sex with his friends and to be quiet cause the government are listening. After that I told my dad and of other stuff happened but the main thing was that I just didn’t want everyone I knew my whole life to know.But eventually I travelled and moved with my grandparents and everything seemed to be working out, I started school again and made friends quick, my dad was going travel in soon. But then my mom managed to find me (we’ve visited before but she was supposed to be staying at a friends or going back home for a bit to have a break). Eventually it all settled after a lot of tension initially and everything seemed to be going back to normal.Then recently she just to act differently again, I first shrugged it off cause I knew ever since the incident we all changed and thought she was just adjusting. But today I just saw all the signs again.She was going hyper doing as many things as possible, then had this new relevation on a new activity it turns out she always loved, keeps making backhanded comments at my dad, sent me a message on a nostalgic memory and how she always loves me and forced my dad to throw his bed sheets out the dryer because it finished early but she just played with the settings cause she didn’t like the sound.I know this is a bit much but I didn’t know what was relevant and what wasn’t. I could’ve easily wrote a lot more on what happened and what I feel but I want to fix this first. I haven’t been able to vent because I don’t want my dad to know I’m struggling.

1c67zyd;tw: idk if its rape child abuse or assault help me define it;cloudsurfinggg;Idk if Im traumatised or stuff, I was abused as a child sexually by a man 6 years elder than me. I was 14 he was 20. We used to chat alot and I was very insecure about how I looked and he used to give me so much attention he called me bestfriend and I saw no harm in that. I was just happy that someone wanted to spend time with me and talk to me ig. So I had already known him for a year and half but I don’t remember I was 15 or 14 when this first thing happened. We were in my room, and talking and we were sitting close. We were hugging and all of a sudden he asked - “you have never kissed before na?” I said no or I just moved my head saying no (I don’t remember correctly). Then he started kissing me. Idk how it felt but not romantic, I didn’t stop or didn’t say no for the kiss. Then he started touching me inappropriately, in my pants and THERE. I moved his hands away and said NO this time. But we were still kissing. He kept coming to touch me and I kept moving his hands away. He eventually stopped with his hand but we were still kissing. This happened. After that, we didn’t talk about the touch. But he said the kiss was good, and I just agreed. Now, I don’t usually go out with him, so we used to chat alot. Idk how this happened where it started but he made me watch porn or maybe he just suggested. He said it was healthy or stuff, I watched and I didn’t know it was wrong, I thought it to be something common. Then things started going downhill, we had sex, idk if its manipulation or not. Idk if I wanted it or not at that moment. I know that I didn’t like it. He used to cover my face when doing it, so I don’t scream. That was the most embarrassing and terrible thing for me, him covering my face idk. This I remember not liking. This happened 4-5 times ig. I remember one time I was really sad, and he had known that my parents were out. I thought that he knows Im sad so we wouldn’t be having sex this time. But I was wrong. The first time we had it, I asked randomly what were we now? But he said whatever I want we can be. He said that he didn’t have problem in having me as a gf, but that time I thought what was this thing. This isn’t a way of saying these things, so I said no, even tho I wanted us to be in relationship. We said we loved each other everyday but we weren’t in a relationship because we didn’t define it. Moreover, the sex I am way sure if something like this happened now (Im 18 now) I would say no to. I know I was not liking it. But, I don’t remember saying NO, so is it my fault.

Last week i tried to croak so I posted something on my instagram, left my phone and walked out the house. I was thinking about attempting to take my life via drowning, but I was too chicken shit to do it, I’ll admit that. I went back home, got stopped by police and I didn’t get to work that day. Then I’ve just been very irritated, getting into arguments with everyone in my life, I had some meltdown last night. That’s not a good thing is it? My meltdowns have been getting worse these last few weeks, and you know what, that’s okay. Because if I do get the courage to croak at least I’m accepting of it. Have you guys thought of killing yourselves?I’ve been having this urge that I need to leave the state. I have the money to go fly out and never come back, so why not? I wanna fly away.

I try my best to explain, but no matter what I say, they don't seem to understand, or rather want to understand?? And insist on giving me ""professional"" advice on how to manage it, when they clearly don't know what they're talking aboutThese episodes, naturally, also impact my productivity when it comes to work or school. I'm seeking for some tips on how to better communicate to my employers and colleagues that this is my situation, and I can't help it.

1c6732h;I don’t know what to do;Mountain_Draw_3147;This is about my mom’s life, not mineIt would be perfectly accurate to say my mom had a pretty ugly childhood. She had a sister, who always used to be the favourite. Her parents used to go slandering about her to her uncles and aunts. Her parents always used to consider her as a child of someone else. They mistreated her. Its like she would get awards from newspapers because she won a prize and all and her mom would hide it just because she believed it will make her fav child sad. That kind of awful shit. Many more like that happened too. I can’t explain it all here, but you get the idea. She was blamed for everything, her sis used to support her parents and single her out in the family. Toxic. Very.  It’s safe to say that her family was narcissistic. Nevertheless, she used to be great friends with her maternal cousins and her sister was part of the group too. Coming to now, her sister and the other relatives from her maternal side have grouped up against her. Also, her parents are dead. She was the one who looked after them. Her sis didn’t even do much because she used to say she had to work. So, the relatives and her sis celebrate everything luxuriously. She is the only person who is not invited to anything. Except for funerals and marriages. This fight started some time ago because of some meaningless thing. It's not better that my mom was married off to a person whose family was full of evil people too. Who did it? My grandfather itself. My dad used to say cruel things to her because she asked for money for educating my sis. He did not allow her to work. He obeyed whatever his family told him. His elder sister was adamant that my mom should not work. And she is highly qualified. They lied about my dad's profession to get him married. She wanted to divorce but couldn't because then all of her family would turn against her. They would say that she was the reason her sister could not get married (Note that in this place, arranged marriage is more prevalent). She had nowhere to go to. So she decided to put up with it. They are clearly terrible. She is an orphan. Her whole family has turned against her. Her family used to be her friends. So now she has no friends. She sits in the house all day, thinking about this. Sinking day by day into depression and I can't watch it anymore. Someone, pls help! She is in her late fourties now. She has no interest in anything anymore. She used to love the subject she was a master at. But as she has got out of touch for a looooong time, she isn't interested in the things she used to be. She isn't interest in her earlier profession too. She used to love doing housework, but her health is not that great too. Doing it makes her body pain a lot. So now, she has nothing to get engaged with and she is not interested in doing anything new. Also, pls don't advice therapy because someone told my mother that going for therapy is useless, all they do is give you more medications and they are not that great here. I don't think she'll up to online therapy too... She doesn't like it when i bring the subject of counselling i think. Idk. I think the thing about therapists might be true here.

Here's a bit about what I'm going through:Delusion of Becoming Great: I often find myself caught up in grandiose fantasies of achieving greatness, which sometimes feel out of touch with reality.Mood Swings: My emotions seem to fluctuate wildly – one moment I'm filled with joy and optimism, and the next, I'm overwhelmed with sadness and uncertainty.Overthinking: I tend to overanalyze every situation, replaying conversations and scenarios in my head until they consume my thoughts, leading to increased anxiety and stress.Constant Future-Thinking: My mind is constantly racing, obsessing over what the future holds and how I can secure success and validation.Hyper-Competitive Nature: I have this intense drive to outperform others, which can be exhausting and often leads to unnecessary stress and tension in my relationships.Dishonesty and Manipulation: I've noticed a pattern of lying and manipulating situations to make myself look better or to avoid confronting uncomfortable truths.Persistent Self-Image: Despite setbacks and failures, I have this persistent belief that I am destined for greatness, which can be both motivating and isolating.Depression About the Future: While I envision greatness, there's also a looming sense of dread and hopelessness about what lies ahead, which often leaves me feeling paralyzed and overwhelmed.Insomnia: Sleep has become elusive, as my mind refuses to quiet down, leaving me tossing and turning through the night.I know this is a lot to unpack, but any advice, coping strategies, or shared experiences would be immensely appreciated.

1c65lsj;Is this a normal thing? Or a sign of something??;Infinite_Love_9286;I tend to get obsessed with certain things. I know everyone does but mine is to another level. An example would be when I had a crush on someone if they liked something I would become obsessed with it and change my personality to fit in with them. Sure I liked some of the stuff but I wasn’t obsessed with it or the vibe till I met them. Then sometimes it’s just a show or series I watch, I get obsessed and buy everything to do with it and start dressing in a certain way like I’ve seen in the series to later move on. Sure I still like these shows and stuff but I’m not as obsessed as I’ve found something new, unless I get re obsessed.

1c65jib;Is it standard practice to not talk or explain anything to the pacient?;ArtisticPath2087;"My experience Back in 2018 I had a psychotic break. I was paranoid, I was thinking that I am the most horrible person in the world and all the people I meet make fun of me and are sarcastic. So, I was quite paranoid as you can see, but no hallucinations and my thinking was still quite logical. This was the cherrry on top after a life long struggle with depression and anxiety, being bullied and literally not receiving any kind of help. My parents knew about my problems, but they cannot afford to have a ""sick"" child. They re poor. Also, my mother is a narcissist and lack empathy.At that moment, I was financially independent, having my first job so when I accursed them of intruding into my privacy and reading my journal and making fun of me, they brought me to a psychiatrist ( because I would be the one to pay).I was put on a medication, after akathisia, I was switched to another one. It worked like a charm. I was better in days. The problem is that, for me, my experience was real and after weeks in which no one made fun of me, I called my parents and said that I am going to kill myself if they don't tell me why they did this to me. They brought me to the doctor and the doctor just put me on a really high dose and add an extra med. The problem is...I didn't know what a psychosis was, I thought I am there for my life long depression. The doctor didn't mention once the word ""psychosis"" in front of me...When everyone makes fun of you and then all of a sudden no one makes fun of you, it s confusing, isn't it? But the doctor didn't try to reason with me or explain my diagnosis or anything. My diagnosis was severe depression with atypical features. I had no idea what a psychosis is, barely heard the word before so I couldn't put the pieces together and she didn't help me at all. I was a zombie for 3 years (yes, she mentain that high dose - 600mg quetiapine and I was a good girl and didn't complain bc I was afraid). She didn't explain once: 1. My diagnosis 2. My medication and how it works 3. How long should I take them 4. What is the long term prognosis. 5. Not even mentioning the word psychosis 6. She led me to believe I was on antidepressants, when in fact I was on antipsychotics and something used for epilepsy ( Depakine Chrono)I was too afraid to ask anything because she could just up my dose again like she did before...or put me in hospital. I was incapable of asserting my needs.After 3 years, I started to wake up with dead numb arms and legs, like paralysed and then slowly I would try to move them little by little to start using them. I was really scared. I told her, she tried to make me believe I was just sleeping on my arm. After, I insisted she told me to take some expensive B vitamin formula. Since I was already taking multi vitamins as part of my daily routine, it was clear to me that she s not taking me seriously amd she didn't explain to me why vitamin B would help at all.As a result, I took only half of the medicine for a couple of weeks and then I didn't take it all together. After, just a couple of days I wasn t numb anymore, but I was in full blown psychosis. It was hell like no one could imagine. I was still no hallucinations, but I couldn't function at all. Everyone was mercylessly making fun of me. It was like everybody hated me with all their soul. I thought that my diary was public and I am probably being spy on and made fun of 24/7. The most painful was that when I was in that hell my parents revealed to me that if I would have taken the meds carefully for another 2 years, I would have had the chance to a normal life, my doctor told them that I had the chance to be just fine. That was completely new to me, no one told me that!!! I was going there for 3 years, never complaining, always taking my meds on time, but no one cared to inform me about long term prognosis or how the meds work or anything, absolutely anything, no information!! She set a 5 years waiting window but she didn't inform ME!! just my parents and they, of course, didn't speak to me...I was heartbroken because now I may have lost that chance...My doctor put me on the maximum dose of the same shit med, then tried a very expensive new one, and after no result, she put me on olanzapin. Now, I am on 5mg olanzapin for 3 years and haven't had no simptoms.1. Is it standard practice to just not talk and explain anything to the patient and let them go through hell  to find out for themselves what a psychosis is? Or is she kinda shitty?2.

1c65ho1;My gf is pulling both of us down;LyoshaOsgood;"My girlfriend has quite a few mental struggles. She  has trouble regulating her thoughts and emotions on top of being an emotional person by default. She has quite a lot of trauma that she never got help for and she lives with emotionally unstable parents who constantly make her feel worse. She is on antidepressants, but it's not helping as much without proper psychotherapy. I'm not blaming her for anything she says, thinks or feels. It's not her fault that she feels awful. But she always pushes it into my face. I have no trouble helping her out and supporting her whenever she needs it and reaches out to me. She says I'm the only person who don't blame her and actually help her. But recently a few things happened in her life and now she constantly sends me texts like ""I'm broken, I'm empty inside"" ""I don't give a fck"" ""im gonna smoke."" ""I really want to smoke."" ""I feel awful."" And so on. My attempts to listen and support her end up being ignored or she just keeps going and going abd going. I feel awful for her and I hate to see her in this pit again, I myself was depressed to the awful point two years ago. But everything I see from her recently, every day, is all the same messages, all the same things that I can't help her with. Whenever i try to offer her support or just help with something to make it easier she just texts me that she doesn't even care anymore about getting better. I am scared for her because she might reach a breaking point and do something to herself or cut all ties with people. I want to help her a d support her, but she doesn't let me to do it properly. She's stuck in these thoughts and keeps talking about it. I'm tired and don't even feel anything but worry in the last few days, a d I feel guilty for thinking that she should deal with it herself mostly,not only with pushing all this on me.

1c64zym;What is it called when your mental energy is suddenly drained, and you're just tired, without being sad or angry?;fmmajd;After a few very stressful events in just 2-3 days(very serious events, like the possibility of losing my loved ones in very tragic ways, and other loved ones battling difficult health conditions), I found myself crying or getting angry at the smallest things one day. I stopped and examined the situation, and noticed that probably I have exhausted my emotional capacity. I keep imagining a glass of water that became full with the events of those days, and then the small events were the last drops that caused the overflow.     Now I am not angry anymore, I just feel drained. I start crying at the smallest thing, like for example, a 2-minute delay in deliveries, or having to continue a conversation for more than 2 sentences. I do not necessarily feel sad while crying, just that I can't take it, anything, anymore. It has also had some physical effect. I have no energy/motiviation/desire(I really don't know which one) to do anything I did just two days before. Taking walks, working, counting calories, washing the dishes, etc.    I am not depressed. In fact, I'm in a very good place in my life. This was a sudden development with no prior 'gradual' things happening before it. I do have a history of depression and being on medicine, but it was in the past. I also used to have regular therapy sessions, but since I'm much better, they are very infrequent right now(with the approval of the therapist).    I'd like to point out that I am not afraid of or worried about this phase. During the course of therapy, I've learned to embrace bad feelings too and accept them as natural human developments. I'm just asking if anyone knows what it's called so that I can do some research and do some self-caring to help with the recovery.

Life is all about experience and unfortunately pain is a part of it too.That being said, pain is what I’m experiencing in life so far right now. I posted on this forum two years ago after feeling so stuck after I tried to end it. I look back at that post and see how much I have grown thanks to many people that popped up in my life. (Same with that one commenter that left such a beautiful heartfelt message that encouraged me to try again) I became a person I am proud of. Recently however, I have not. I feel like I have lost a lot of my support as people grow apart or become busy with life. But it has left me feeling so alone. My boyfriend has been with me through it all and I feel like I see such a nasty self hatred monster of myself come out when I become scared that I will lose him too. I lost so much too early in life that when I think about losing someone dear to me I lose it. And we both agreed at some point it has to be time for us to grow by ourselves for a while but I’m so terrified of losing him. He’s my best friend. He’s inspired and changed me so much for the better. But I hate that I don’t think I did that for him. I hate that I hate myself. If I didn’t life would be so much better and I would keep the ones I love close to me. I feel like such an idiot. I don’t think I can ever forgive myself for making him cry or feel emotionally exhausted. I want to keep getting better but I always hit a hard wall and ruin something. I just want to be normal.

1c64s1t;The mind of a sadist;Alternative-Rub6623;"I rarely feel guilty, most of the time i feel that people deserve to be hurt (mentally). I.e, if someone hurts me, they deserve to get hurt the same way but worse if that makes sense. I feel some people can’t understand unless it’s done to them. I look at it as a game even. Like any time someone does something hurtful or disrespectful to me, i see it as them moving their chess piece. Then i’ll make my move and hurt them as well. Even if they do it unintentionally, or intentionally, I tend to think strategically about it; what can I do to make them feel the same pain as me, and waiting out enough time so that they forget what they did to me, therein, when I do it in return, it hurts worse for them because they don’t see the motive. If you pay back the pain too quickly, they may just see it as you doing it out of pettiness.     I haven’t always been this way though, I used to be very loving, very caring of every one and overly sensitive to every little thing. I got beat into this way. I had no choice but to turn out like this. It wasn’t planned but I was practically self taught, from experience that you can only care about yourself, and trust no one. Now with this mindset I get hurt a lot less. I may hurt others, but life was never fair to begin with. It is what it is quite literally.     Do I want to stay like this? I’m not sure. I miss who I was sometimes, but when I think about it I was just a piece of gum stuck on the floor getting stepped on by everyone, until it was flattened.      Don’t think i’m some asshle who is mean to everyone for no reason. No, i’m not an evil person, though i’m not good either. I just try to be fair in every way possible. Remember what they say, treat others the way you want to be treated. Or as I like to think, treat others how they treat you.

1c64o3r;How to forgive yourself for hurting yourself?;Mean_Concentrate814;So I am higschool junior. The first 2 grades I mostly spend in house because I was depressed. After that I started to changing myself and my life turned around. I started to eat clean, going to the gym, meditating and listen to affirmations. My life never was better, I promise you. I was so happy, I started to fall in love with life. But one thing happened that I didn’t predict is I had big spiritual awakening. I opened my third eye and I had big realization about what is going on really in world. I began to understand how works illuminati and what they plan to do. First thing what I thought that I should is to tell everybody around me what elites are about to do (because I got this knowledge) and in my opinion if anyone knows something which affects lives of society should do something with that. So I told my family about how the government plans to control humanity with ai and brain chips. Then I did something extremely stupid, because I printed the whole page explaining what illuminati plans to do and gave it to my classmates… But to defend myself I was completely aware that everybody will laugh at me, but I wanted in anyway to touch the topic, even if it means making a scandal. Because at the end of the day the most important thing is common good. So I did it and it was the worse decision in my life, because I had very happy life for which I worked very hard and giving away these pages I gave myself trauma. Many people was very happy with the fact what I did and they use it against me. People were happy that I embarrassed myself. But now lets move on. I was so naive, I didnt change school because I thought that If I got this information and now I know that the school knowledge is full of lies I thought that God will help me to get out of school😭Right now my biggest nightmare happened, because I was so stressed being in this class. I couldnt sleep, I lost half of my hair. I had long hair and now I have them short like a boy, because they started getting so thin… I got into huge depression. I didnt wanted to go to school in these year because I worked on myself and I hoped that God will help me manifest my dream job.  But it didnt happened.I truly hate myself. I had depression and I was panicking when I was 16 but I got out of it because I started putting myself together. When I was 17 my life was amazing, I loved it so much, but in these time my third eye opened… This decision ruined my life. Now I am 18 depressed, without hair and very bad mental health… In November I will be 19. I really dont like what I did because I panicked and this one decision will affect next two years. Even if I had best intentions I fcked my life. When I had these realization about evil elites and spiritual awakening I started hating school even more because I realized that we are being lied to even by school system. It’s hard for myself to look myself in the mirror, I just panicked. Please never open your third eye if you are not ready…;So I am higschool junior.

1c642m9;I feel this sort of inner intolerance, like i can't describe what's wrong with me;AshesX;Hey, so I wanna preface this by saying that I'm diagnosed bipolar and currently on 4 different medications (Venlafaxine, Trazadone, Aripiprazole and Flupentixol).I have either some intense side effects or something's very wrong with me. I feel off all the time, to the point where it's unbearable, ever since i started taking aripiprazole I haven't been able to think of what to talk about and my thoughts have been like a blank. I have severe apathy and anhedonia. Most of the time I feel nothing, but also a constant sense of inner unease and something I can't describe. I feel like my days are unbearable, but I'm not extremely sad or anything.   I feel like something is off very badly, I also feel super incapable of anything, my days have consisted of laying in bed and trying to talk to friends through the internet so I have company. I'm nauseous all the time and I feel like a sense of extreme inner unease. I honestly am at a wits end to describe exactly what I'm feeling. I feel both tired and like I can't sit still anymore, but I am able to actually sit still. I feel like I don't feel anything, but it also feels unbearable. I have lost interest in basically everything and I don't know what to talk about, I find it hard to structure my thoughts because I feel like i have no thoughts. It just feels like my brain is overloaded by foreign feelings that I can't put into words.  I also recently (started a month ago) changed my main antidepressant from Paroxetine to Venlafaxine over the course of 10 days while tapering the old one and steadily increasing the dose of my new one.  I wake up with anxiety, I don't know if this is important, but recently I've started sweating a lot from my face and head. I constantly think there's something wrong with me.

1c63vxr;She Went Crazy;Correct_Elephant5703;"I've been with my partner for 15 years. She's 38 I'm 35M no kids. Her moods have been spiraling since November and they've manifested as jealousy and controlling behavior. She gets into my stuff and always used them as evidence or proof that I was cheating. These were the early warning signs and I was dismissive and thought she was just being a dick to me. I should've done better.We have a really solid foundation and this deterioration only started in 2022. That's why I'm willing to fight for this relationship.Anyway, we'd get into nasty fights over my alleged cheating and when I got tired of proving the ways it was impossible and how busy and tired I am all the time providing for her and how logistically unlikely even me going out to fuck was, the fights eventually devolved into ad hominem attacks both ways. I took it personally as I would never cheat, but I do enjoy being given the space and flexibility to live my life and have my friends as anyone else would.It truly got toxic and I regret every second of it. I lashed out back at her in ways I shouldn't ever have. I told her she was ungrateful. I told her I deserved better in terms of trust and faith given what I do. I called her a dildo (when I resort to name-calling I make sure to swap it to a really stupid name.), etc..# BackgroundTo give a few examples:- A towel in my kitchen she hadn't recognized. I couldn't account for it. Towels come and go. She looked up unboxing videos of all my kitchenware to find where it could've come from. Nobody could account for that towel. I'm not going to commit to memory every little knickknack I bring from work or buy somewhere or order online.- Another example, she built up one of my female friends as an antagonist and started blowing up her spot asking if there was anything between us. She's sort of built her up as an antagonist and I've been nothing but transparent about my relationship with her, but she latches onto every little thing as ""proof"". She knows my friend likes blue and once I bought my partner a blue outfit and thought I was trying to ""turn [her] into [my friend].""- Last example, I've never felt comfortable having her on my social media. She reads into every interaction and finds conflict and pain there. But she tracks the fluctuations in my follower/following count. She correlates them to events and thinks that I'm either adding people I shouldn't be (exes, flings, APs), or unadding people to cover my tracks.And my dumbass thought she was just being a dick.I'm not writing this to blast on my partner.  I truly love her. Her presence is so large in my heart I cannot overstate it and she completes my life. The suffocating jealousy stuff leads to nasty fights where I snap back, but when the relationship works, it works well. The reason I wrote those examples was I should've seen what happened next.# Symptoms/TimelineDay OneShe was fine. Coherent. Lucid. Talking and functioning with me. She was making dinner and she called me over to the kitchen in a panic. She made me take a drink of water from a glass. She said it so panicked that I relented and then she said ""Spit it out!!"". I'm like why? She said, ""I thought you would die."" I was dumbfounded. I thought she was fucking with me or making a point about gaslighting given our last jealousy fight.She gradually snapped. I did not realize it but she was going completely bonkers. She started saying things that made less and less sense over time. ""My brain is trying to kill itself."" She was still so sharp she knew what was happening before I did.Hours later she lost her grip in reality and started asking me impossible questions. She asked me if I was her mother reincarnated. She asked me if I was her cat. She thought her family died and broke out into pure panic/ugly-crying. I called them to disprove that and she calmed down. I started taking it serious, obviously.She started showing more and more erratic behaviors. She wasn't sleeping. Woke me up every few hours to ask me questions about ghouls and demons and her childhood . She told me childhood sexual traumatic events that she later admits couldn't possibly be real (molested by people who were dead at the time). She started telling me about the ghosts that live in my house and how they talk to her. Her gaze fixated on random spots in the wall. I would ask ""What's there?"" she'd answer: ""you know what's there.""Terrifying behavior, and it got worse.Day TwoNext day I couldn't keep her focused. The extent of her focus was essentially half a sentence and she couldn't maintain conversational continuity. I couldn't ask follow-up questions about something she said 15 seconds ago. It was extremely painful and it's as if she became a shell of her former self. I thought I lost her and I was distraught.Then the screaming started. She would cry and scream in sheer terror. I lost it. I'm not a crier, but this week I've cried more than I've cried in my entire life. Seeing her in that unbelievable, undefinable pain tore me to pieces. I thought I lost my girl forever and I practically begged her to come back to me. She'd cry with me but she lost the capacity to understand anything.I took her to the E.R.. They basically made sure she wasn't a danger to me or herself and did the basic bloodwork and vitals and sent her on her way. She can present mostly normal under social pressure by this point, but I was disappointed with the result. They gave me a psychiatrist appointment... for next week.Day ThreeThe next day was absolute terror. My life was a horror movie with screaming and crying and bouts of random rage. At times I could bring her out and talk to her, but she could not focus on me. I tried to get her to eat. She'd take 2-3 bites of food at most. I was very strict and made her sleep in the evening. She'd pop up behind me like a ghost every 45 minutes. I started treating her like a child (I had to). I limited what shows she could watch because some shows had content she couldn't handle and would send her into another screaming frenzy. The milder shows that we rewatch often bothered her too, she would think the show's plot never played out before the way it is playing out now. She thought I was gaslighting her.The screaming was so bad I got a letter from the H.O.A.Day FourThe day after that I took her to the E.R. again. She could present less normally this time around. They'd ask her the basic questions and she'd stare blankly for 40 seconds... ""I'm sorry what was the question?""I'm sitting there like a dummy like ?????? are you not seeing this? They didn't get her a psychiatrist then either. They prescribed her a drug, but I couldn't fill the prescription that night.Final DayThe final day, it got to the lowest point. She could no longer function. It was pure screaming. No conversation. Her body would go completely limp and then she'd have random ticks. Snapping, mouth clicking. She'd arrange dumb table things (wallet, keys, phone) in a very orderly way and then go limp or sway her head.I tried to get her to understand that I needed to send her to go get help. She'd nod and agree. I tried to ask her to write it for me so I know some part of her is there. She wrote some creepy shit on the paper and nonsense hieroglyphs.I had desperately navigated our country's (US) arcane medical system and finally got some county people to show up and take her away to an involuntary mental health clinic. They've started treatment and observation and finally got her some good help. I've been calling her every day and little by little she's coming back to me.She can keep longer conversations and recall things that have been said minutes ago. The mood swings are still in effect. When I'm sweet to her she starts sobbing which leads to her saying delusional things but I can talk her down out of it. When we joke she's the most herself. She adores dark humor. I told her ""If you told me I'd be in a mental hospital someday in the near future, I'd think it was for me."" and she laughed and called me a crazy. She can barely recall hellweek.She's normally sharp and resourceful. She's the one I come to for advice in navigating life stuff like the medical system. So when she left me like that, I was lost and in a panic. I tried to fish her out to ask her things like: ""If you were in my position, what would you do?"" Which is totally unfair and I shouldn't have pressured her to try and think so hard and I'm really sorry. She couldn't give me a straight answer.PresentEvery day I call her she's a little more her. It's looking good and I hope to have her back home soon. I never knew I could be in this much pain to see a loved one fall apart. In hindsight the jealous bullshit doesn't matter anymore. I know there's a reason for it. And I need to take ownership and get her help she needs to deal with those manic feelings of persecution. I never validated her jealousy feelings, I always confronted them head-on. I figured validating them was admitting that I had cheated or flirted with someone, but I could've also gently validated (without gaslighting) that there is a very good reason for them, and that is her deteriorating mental health and gotten her help. I regret not doing better.# Why I'm HereAnyway, I didn't see the early warning signs. She had a psychiatrist but she stopped seeing them 7 months ago. She quit her prescriptions around the same time. Little by little she started unraveling and I did not recognize it in time before I had to have her committed.I want to know: What could I have done better to support her?What could she be going through? Can you help me understand it? The doc says it's likely a mood disorder with psychotic features. That this is easily treatable and people who are willing to be helped come back from it. She is a smart girl, and she's very eager to get better.What could that diagnosis mean? Something like BPD? I'm just looking for any insight at this moment. I've bugged her poor social worker with a million questions and I'm wanting to dig deeper and hear your insights. Obviously I'd take it with a grain of salt and wouldn't act on it.Last point of concern, she keeps complaining about pains in her body. Often the back of her head or ribs. Could these be physiological? Could the E.R. have detected anything seriously wrong here (god-forbid a brain tumor)? Or could it be psychosomatic? The pain comes and then goes like it was never there.Thanks, internet.";I've been with my partner for 15 years. She's 38 I'm 35M no kids.

1c63f91;I'm lost...;No_Operation_2337;"I'm hurting in so many ways. I don't even no where to begin.  I'm married to what I want and believe is my soul mate...my twin flame.  We've been together since we were 17 (24 years and married 16).  Like all couples We've had our fair share of ups and downs.  I started my healing journey over 2 years ago at 38 and have made huge strides in my mental health and relationship...none of which acknowledged by my better (or lesser?) Half.  I never thought I suffered from trauma bc I always thought trauma was physical or sexual.  Mine was emotional.  Or lack there of.  My father was a good man...the greatest father who ever lived.  But he was an alcoholic.  As i started becoming a man he slowly started not being there.  I don't know what's worse...the dad who goes to get milk and never comes back or the dad who one day you wake up and he's gone? From my healing journey I've learned ALOT of things.  Boundaries, how to fix the hole in my love cup, my validation issues, as well as that trauma is carried in us for 3 generations.  My grandma cheated, my dad cheated, and sadly I cheated.  I hate myself everyday for what I did.  But just like an an Olympic athlete who broke their leg and failed.  I didn't give up. I worked on myself.  I've been going twice a month for the past almost 3 years to personal counseling and have worked on so many things to become a better husband, father, and man.  What I struggle with now is that I suffer from severe anxiety.  Which as most know turns into depression.  But from my counseling and personal work I have beat my depression.  The problem is I still suffer from anxiety from time to time.  But I deal with it pretty well.  I run a very successful landscape company and from ""March madness"" to ""April radness"" I am balls to the wall.  Every spring my wife and I usually go to hell and back again.  My stress is at an all time high but I do pretty damn well at dealing with it day in and day out.  But my drug of choice/love language is music.  And I don't think it's too much to ask to go to a concert at minimum once a month...if not twice.  All I do is work and come home.  I have built literally a fucking paradise (I've attached pictures to show). My life this March and April has been nothing but work and cheer comps and family functions.  It's been almost 2 months since my last concert and I asked my wife (after a 2 day cheer comp and watching her brothers fucking whining ass twins the weekend before) to go to one of my top 3 fave artists Paul Cauthen  next weekend and the response I got hurt me.  She told me ""he's not my vibe"".  I'm taking her and my 10 year old obsessed daughter to Poland to see Taylor Swift (who's not my vibe yet I'm learning every word to every song).  I do ALOT of shit that's ""not my vibe"" but if my wife asked me to go see Morgan Wallen who I cant stand I'd suck it up and go. So that hurtWe just got done with a 2 day cheer comp that I pushed through and the day we were leaving I fell asleep on the drive home bc I was physically and mentally exhausted.  She stopped at Buccees to get gas and left me in the car in 80 degree heat with the windows rolled up.  I woke up 30 minutes later ""suffocating"" (not really but hot AF with stale air).  I opened the door to get fresh air and her God dman alarm starts going off nonstop.  Mind you I'm coming out of a deep slumber and people are looking at me like I'm trying to steal her fucking volkswagen atlas.  I don't know about you but ANYONE I know that gets woken up abruptly from a nap is not going to be kosher.  I call her and tell her she needs to get out here ""to turn her fucking car alarm off"".  Apparently we can cuss like sailors all day long but the minute I say ""fucking"" it's enough to piss her off that she tells me I'm a ""shitty person"".  So of course that irritates me even more that I remain silent all the way home and because of that I'm even ""shittier"" bc I let the gas station incident bother me when I know damn well she would never leave her fucking dog in the car with the windows rolled up for 30 minutes.   I'm not even on the same level of respect as this fucking fluffy ass labradoodle bitch ass dog.   And now bc I've brought up my feelings I've been made to feel like shit once again where I (like most husbands) wish I would of never said shit and just stuffed it deep down inside until I finally commit schmuicide leaving everyone (mostly her) wondering ""omg I have no idea why he did it"".I'm building so much fuckig hate and resentment towards her that I just want to say fuck it and get drunk as shit and fuck any and everything in front of me.

1c63a2d;Cousin possibly depressed - how do I help her?;Pinkypiesho;Hi everyone!I am looking for some advice on how to approach this situation.I asked my cousin if I could use her bathroom for a shower since I am here for the holidays, but as soon as I entered her room the state of it raised some serious concerns: unkempt, hoarder-y, messy, clutter, etc. the most extreme stuff you could see on TV in which regular cleaning is not enough and you’d need professionals to do the job. You get the idea.I felt really bad for her and I almost wanted to cry after seeing her room. Her room has never been in this extreme state. I strongly suspect she’s depressed due to her mom’s passing a few years back and she probably doesn’t realize it. I do not want her to be suffering in silence if that is the case.The mental health topic is kinda taboo in her conservative country so I’m afraid being direct and suggesting to seek mental help might offend her or assume she’s “insane”, which is NOT the case at all. I want her to be in a better head space and living space. I want her to know that someone cares for her. I was thinking of hiring a cleaning service but how do I approach this gently?

1c634gi;I just don't know anymore.;Pbrakels;"I'm 40 soon, and my life feels like it's slipping away from me. This isnt where i wanted to be at this stage in life. I just want to end it...start over (if you believe in reincarnation - I wish)Backstory - about 14 months ago I was told by my wife she wanted space.. we had been together for 12 years married 10. We were a blended family with 4 children in total (2 hers and 2 ours.. ages f15, m13, m11, f9).. she has a disability support business and I am a self employed IT guy. I was the sole provider for my family for 90% of our time together. She was a stay at home mum. Then 2 years ago with my help she started this business she currently throws herself into. I was a retail manager for most of our time together until I hated not having weekends with my family so I made a change.Our relationship was not the greatest but I was doing everything in my power to make it better.. constant therapy. Daily medication. I truly had in my mind .""if I fix myself ill fix my marriage,"" years of therapy.. time.. all goneI found out a few months ago my wife (ex) is seeing a guy we knew. We knew him because he is the husband of one of her clients (lady dying of dementia).. yes I said that.. husband. He's older by some 20 years.. has money..I have asked her why, and she says he gives her stability and security. Money more likely and on a side note im pretty positive she cheated on me with him.. but i will never know. I hate this. Not knowing stuff..I love her, and feel I can't live without her or my kids/family. In my short 40 years she was/is/has been the best thing I ever had. I don't know happiness anymore... everything is dull. Kids visit... meh. I find a girl who is into me and wants to be in my life... meh. Why!? I just want to be happy again. Like I was.. or better.. I want my family and life back.. it wasn't great but it was better than this.. I hate myself for letting it happen.. for letting it go. You will all say live for your kids.. I say to this, my time with my children currently is temporary and then when their mother picks them up or I drop them home again.. I'm back to lonely. Quiet. Sad. Depressed. Sitting in my head trying to ""not think about"".. that's a joke it's impossible to not think about what or who you love or miss and care for.The quiet times are filled with regret and sadness and good memories (sadly). I feel it would be easier to not have them for periods then to have them and get sad constantly.i know they will be looked after. And the money that my death would bring to them would get them ahead in this messed up world.I have tried so much to stay here. Only thing I haven't done is run. Run away from these issues, escape and try to start over... somewhere else. Somewhere new. Away from her and the kids (I'm sorry kids I love you so much I just hurt all the time) I would only try this to regain some semblance of self worth.. me. I live near my family and see them often. She (ex) still has access to me and I'm trying to put more barriers in place so that contact is just kids. But honestly I get sad at it being only this, I just want to talk to her. For her to give a shit about me again. To know how her day was, everyday...Fast forward to now. Today. This very second as I write this. I feel like ending it. Leaving this world. What's sad here is I currently have my kids with me...I have.. Anxiety for days on end (hard to breathe), Panic attacks usually slip in and out. Sleep plagued with ""good memories"" that haunt me like nightmares.. waking me up, so I'm not sleeping great. Eating is a struggle but I do it when I can stomach something. I go for walks to clear my head.. basic exercise. I am high functioning depressive.. because I'm self employed if I don't work I can't afford my bills. So my work it's a temporary distraction from all of this but it's simply a mask that goes on as needed, and comes off just as quick.I know in my heart it's done. It's over. She made choices. There isn't anything I can do. Above all this, the woman she was when we married, is who I love(d). Not the person she is now. Her work is her priority now... not even our kids.I'm lost and confused and hurting in a world I dont want to be a part of.. I try to say to myself it's not that bad. Look at what's going on in the world... I would trade being scared in a war-torn country with my family, knowing I'm loved and I love them for this shit any day.I'm sorry if I offend people.

I feel bad for lying to them about this because they have high expectations, and them finding out about me missing out most of my school days would anger them since they don't see mental health as an excuse to miss school even if I'm struggling to stay alive. They do know that I go to therapy since I've told them a little about my social anxiety, but that's only about 20% of what I am going through. The worst part of it is that I might have to repeat this school year because of my bad attendance, and they still don't know about it. I also talked to my therapist about it, and she recommended inviting them to one of my therapy sessions and telling them my struggles, but I'm unsure.

1c62x97;I dont know… me;No_Sprinkles_5614;When i was in my senior high, I had a major depression. I was ridiculed by those around me saying how I was an attention seeker, I was getting thinner (barely eating anything), sleeping in class and at home, flashbacks of traumatic episodes and assaults, crying, and constantly having suicidal episodes. It was a tough time, and now I am in college! I was getting better, I believe I am better. But there is one thing I can’t let go, self harm. It wasnt that a big of a deal to me. Its the only thing that keeps me safe, keeps me happy until it gets too toxic by od, cutting areas of my bodies where no one can see, punching myself, scatching till i get friction burns, stabbing myself till i bleed. I do this when I get overwhelmed, when I get panic attacks, when I get depressive episodes or sometimes, idk no reason. There’ll be times where I feel so happy, i have a really great facade then months or days after I get depressed and when I do, I cant do anything. I cant do any task, I blame myself for everything, all I do is cry. Believe me I try my best to go out, do things I love, but I cant. I cant i cant i cant. Recently, i feel like im being swallowed. I have 3 part time jobs, a class, and I dont even know why im taking all these when I know Im not capable of finishing it on time.  But i do it anyways. I have no one to reach out too. Idk where to go. I’m so tired of myself. I hate myself, i feel like idk who I am. I dont understand myself. Idk … me. Please dont judge me.;When i was in my senior high, I had a major depression.

I’m in my early 20s now and I still live with my mom and step father. I moved in during highschool. My step father shows no signs of animal abuse now but I remember years ago he would hit the dogs we had at home because of his stress at work. He has thrown my cat into the wall before too. My mom and step dad ended up giving them away and bought another dog. I haven’t seen my dad hurt our new dog, and it’s been a couple of years since we got her. I have a closer relationship with my mom and step dad yet I still feel resentment towards them. Especially how my step dad abused them and how my mom and step dad emotional abused me. And his excuse is that back in their day, the elders would beat their pets as well. I want to love my step dad but this horrible past still makes me angry.. and I can’t seem to completely let go even though this is in the past. My mom forced me to apologize to my step father when I defended my cat and dogs when they got abused. Is it normal to still feel angry at him?

1c62oru;Betrayal support;Eandari1;I’ve been struggling. I was in love with someone. We were not together but admittedly by both sides we were both leaning deeper into the relationship since August. We weren’t seeing anyone else. We spent every day together. Involved deeply in each others lives. No sex but a lot of physical touch… massages etc. We have been friends 5 years. The last 2 more intense. We are both women. She was straight. I’m bisexual but mostly heterosexual, until her. She was my best friend and our closeness created intimacy and feelings we both shared. The day before Thanksgiving she met a man, and instantly pretty much fell in love.. he doesn’t live local so that means she disappears for large amounts of time, pretty much no contact. Tonight I find out she wants to start a family with him. There seems to be no acknowledgment on her part that this was a massive betrayal to me. In addition the first two months I went through a hideous amount of slander, making me “wrong” for our relationship. Saying she didn’t want to be with me, but yet she was often the initiator of all of our outings, physical moments, intimacy and flirtation. She has sense profusely apologized for what she said. Over and over.Knowing she’s with him is torture. Now knowing she wants a family with him.. what do I do? I feel like any normal person would cut ties. But I feel like I don’t have the right because we were not in a committed romantic relationship. She says she wants me in her life.  And understands it’s painful for me.. but tonight she shared this about a family with him, directly after me telling her I can’t accept hearing too much about him with out us healing first. The biggest part of my world came crashing down in an instant in November, and I still can’t seem to recover in fact it only seems to get worse. My mental health is severely suffering, and I worry.. this is the kind of stuff that breaks people. I feel sick that I can’t step to cut her off completely. Maybe it takes time to get the strength or maybe I don’t have the right because we weren’t “together”.;I’ve been struggling. I was in love with someone.

I’m not even kidding I self harmed without even realizing what I was doing was self harm all throughout elementary school.My dad (don’t consider him my father anymore btw) and my mom had gone through a nasty divorce for years. And luckily it’s over and he’s completely out of my life now, but I will never forget the constant fighting the constant memories of my mom in tears and me as an elementary schooler having to witness it. But the main thing I never forget was the time my dad had beaten me to the point where I think I numb. I never said anything about to this day, I don’t wanna stress my mom out cause she does enough for me already. The way I coped with all of this was self harming and of course suicidal thoughts went along with it.But another I will never forget was the time my sister told me that she wished I were dead. I never forget that, she makes me feel like I’m a bad sister when I’m trying my best. I don’t know though she might be right i probably am the worst sister.Ever since my mom found out I was self harming in 4th grade, she tricked me into going my aunts house and they both made me talk instead of a one on one with me and my mom. Somehow though during this conversation she gaslit herself into thinking I was just looking for attention and that I really don’t wanna kill myself, and all I did was agree with her.She also threatened me along the lines of if I did that my sisters might do what I did and kill themselves to. That was pressuring and not very helpful.Towards the beginning of the year, I had a history teacher at one point that would touch me (not in anywhere nessesarily inappropriately.) but he used to put his hand on my should and let it linger there for a suspicious amount of time and he would also let his hand linger on mine for unneeded time whenever he or I was handing some to each other. Not to mention there was a whole month or two of him only really checking up on me. And I could’ve been overreacting but I was genuinely a little scared of going to his class. But at some point it stopped and I had never told anyone to this day.Over time though (talking about now) I’m still not sure if my suicidal thoughts had gotten worse or I’m recovering just on my own. Cause on one hand it not as consistent but at moments it’s a random quiet thought and on the other hand, whenever i fuck something up, the suicidal thoughts are a lot worse and it’s to the point where I actually get close to taking my own life.Anyways, I have no idea what to do or how to deal with this, I don’t wanna tell my guardian or any other trusted adult about this because it’ll all lead back to my mom and since my mom is a single and a stressed out nurse.

1c62e3d;I feel like I've lost my emotions ;kregory2348;I dunno, over the last couple of years a feeling of just total and complete depression swept over me. My mom told me I was always a depressed kid and never really acted or emoted happiness. But recently ive started to feel less and less alive. Like I cant make meaningful connections with people and I cant really feel much of anything. I feel empty would be the best way to describe it. Ive tried everything, therapy, exercise, getting out more, socializing more (as much as the panic attacks will allow), but none of it seems to work. The people I call my friends dont really seem to care when I try to talk to them about it and they only ever wait to talk about their problem. Not like my problems are theirs or anything. Anyway The feeling of emptiness has led me to cutting myself, just so I can feel human. Like im not a husk or completely emotionless. I started when a girl I thought Inloved dumped me and no matter how hard I tried or how sad I wanted to be I just couldnt be. I cant cry or feel sad or angry or happy or anything. So I cut myself to feel alove, to make sure im still living. It has helped with the suicidal thoughts, I went fron fantasizing about suicide to fantasizing about cutting myself, so I guess that is an upgrade. But I know that cutting CANT be the answer. Like it cant be the only thing that makes me feel alive. I dunno just how do I start feeling like a normal person, I want to stop cutting but im dependent on it to feel like a human.

1c61jwx;I need help ;PositionOk2891;I’ve been feeling horrible for months, I feel like my brain is empty. Sometimes when I’m alone or even around people I just can’t bring myself to feel anything but sadness, guilt or anger. I don’t want to get up or do anything, even going to school has been so hard and exhausting. When I take days off I get behind and then feel like I can’t do anything. The anxiety in the morning when I get up is unthinkable, I can’t even walk out the door without violently crying. I’ve been hinting to the people around me but every time I bring it up they tell me that I probably am just having hormones from growing up (I’m 16 btw). But I know that it’s not just hormones and something is wrong. I’ve also been cutting, it’s the only thing that takes away most of my anxiety when I’m feeling like that. My mom even noticed my thigh one time and all she said was “don’t let me see that again” and walked away. I’ve also been feeling extremely sick lately and I’m worried it’s from me not taking care of myself, I went to the doctor after almost passing out in school multiple times and he said I’m severely underweight but I have always been skinny so I’m not sure. I can’t stand up without getting dizzy and black dots blocking my vision. The only person I think I could talk to is my older brother, but how should I bring something like this up?

1c61arl;My disabled Aunt keeps pestering me to play a game with her, but I just can't anymore. Am I in the wrong?;AvocadoExotic2004;"I(18F) very frequently visit my Grandma and Aunt to help them with stuff and just spend time with them. My Aunt, who is mentally and physically disabled, has lived a life of bullying for it, so she is made to stay inside all the time to avoid it. I recently realized just how lonely and boring her life is most of the time, only leaving the house to go to the store, pay bills or go to the doctors with my Grandma. - To try and fix this a bit, I downloaded a game on her phone(COUGHROBLOXCOUGH) and played it with her to keep her entertained and happy when she would otherwise be doing nothing. She LOVED it and we would play all day, everyday for a over a week(I'm not joking, from the time we woke up to the time we went to bed, we were playing.) I quite enjoyed it as well and played just as eagerly, but started getting tired towards the end of the week.- I quickly stopped wanting to play after we hit the 9th day and so told her I didn't want to play. She was understanding at first, but soon started pestering me about playing. It was annoying, but I understood where she was coming from and didn't really mind, until now. - Now she is CONSTANTLY asking me to play, everytime I come over she asks, everytime she text's me, she asks. I tell her I just don't want to after playing for over a week straight, and she just gives a kinda disappointed groan and begs. I repeatedly tell her ""no"" until my Grandma steps in and tells her to stop. I felt bad and tried to play again, but a big wave of exhaustion washed over me as soon as I opened the app. -It's been three weeks since we last played and she keeps asking constantly to play and it's just making me irritated so now I kinda give a snappy answer and have an annoyed look on my face. She's noticed this and keeps asking me if I'm mad, to which I tell her I'm not, but I am. I'm tired of playing that game and can't play anymore, I can't stand that game now. It's gotten to the point where I've stopped coming over nearly as often, because I don't wanna be bum rushed with that stupid game.-I understand why she keeps pestering me over it, that game is the only thing she really has to stay occupied and socialize, but I just can't stand it anymore. I'm beginning to hate that game and can't help it, but keep getting irritated and almost losing my cool with her everytime she asks me to play. - I feel like a massive piece if shit for acting/thinking like this, but I just CAN'T bear to hear another second of it!";I(18F) very frequently visit my Grandma and Aunt to help them with stuff and just spend time with th;Opinion / Thoughts;1;1;2024-04-17 04:52:09;2024-04-17;Wednesday;04:52:09;2473;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:45.743127

Today it was just him me and one of our friends in a voice call today. They both know I don't like fortnite. I've hated the game since highschool and have vocalized this many times. Instead of including me they decided to play the game. My fiance seems to do this often and whenever I get upset he gets mad at me. Even once telling me I should just break up with him if I'm going to get upset over a game. There is also this game I've been really into lately (helldiver's) and whenever he goes to play it he's already got a party of 4 (max players in one game) and doesn't include me. I'm starting to feel like he just doesn't want to play games with me anymore and it's really upsetting me. I don't know how to tell him that it is though cause I feel like he'll just tell me I'm overreacting. Most days I'm just stuck watching YouTube because all the games I want to play he doesn't. I've tried offering games like raft, it takes two, grounded, lethal company, pal world Minecraft and more. While he has played Minecraft and a game called monster hunter with me but both games only lasted two weeks (monster hunter I believe he's only playing with me because two of our friends bought it and I joined when they started playing). He played lethal company and pal world without me and the other games he won't even try and says they're boring and I shouldn't bother. Maybe I am overreacting.

1c60x2a;I can’t stop thinking about this girl and it’s causing me a lot of distress.;apingpongball;I (19M) recently just broke up with my girlfriend and have been going through a really rough period in my life. I’ve felt depressed throughout this time and while I’m not feeling suicidal at all, I do have a very strong desire for this period of my life to just be over with. At my university I have a class with a girl who is the same grade level as me. I have always thought she is quite attractive but now suddenly I find that I can’t stop thinking of her. I had a dream with her in it a few days ago and since it’s been a real struggle. It feels like no matter what I do I can’t stop the thoughts of her and how much I want to talk with her, yet I am completely unable to. Today in particular though I feel it reached a new height. I had my class with her, never spoke to her, and that was all fine and good. But I had to stay after at the university for an event happening later in the night, and had about 2 hours with nothing to do. I exited the building before she did and I felt compelled to sit down along the way back to my car. Then, I saw her walk past me towards another building. I then felt like I really wanted to walk that way. And I did. I grabbed a coffee at a nearby shop and walked over to that building, in which I saw her and a friend studying. I then walked out, and proceeded to wait for over an hour outside the building. I never saw her leave the building, thankfully, but I don’t know what I would have done if I did. I don’t have her phone number or any way of contacting her, really. And I think that might be for the best. I’ve talked to a friend about this, and while initially it seemed like just a simple crush, he and I both agree that this seems much more like an obsessive situation. It’s to the point where I don’t want to go to this class because I feel such intense guilt for what I’ve done and how I’ve acted. I’m starting to feel intense self loathing towards myself for this and i don’t know what I can do to stop myself from doing this.;I (19M) recently just broke up with my girlfriend and have been going through a really rough period ;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-17 04:30:45;2024-04-17;Wednesday;04:30:45;1981;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:23.654292

1c60w1i;How can i truly overcome childhood traumas?;Ok-343;I have read a lot of books and research about childhood trauma and how to deal with it, but change is very difficult for me. My father is a very violent man with my mother and us since we were young. My mother also, I know, the situation was difficult for her, but unfortunately, she used to do the same. When I was 15 years old, my mother traveled to another country to treat my brother and left us with him for 4 years. Fear was our way of life. If we went out to buy clothes, he chose them for us, and they were very expensive, but not beautiful at all, and we couldn't object. When we got home, he would be very angry because of what we spent. One time I told him that there was a subject in which I could fail, and we got into the car. He started driving the car quickly, right and left, screaming and cursing, telling me that he would kill me and die with me (he wanted me to enter medical school). I was not allowed to cry at any time. My knees were literally shaking from fear. Of course, he always hit us for very trivial reasons. One day, my sister and I were getting ready for school and we fought each other. He was very angry. He took us to the school door, and when we were opening the car door, he told us to lock it. He drove the car a little far from the school, got out, took off his shoes, and started hitting us inside the car, and we were crying. After that, we went back to school because we had exams. Now I am a 23-year-old girl, I cannot deal with people well. Any job I apply to, they reject me because of my calmness and exaggerated shyness. I always get angry inside the house and cannot stand anything. I know that I am good, but I cannot deal with my feelings and mind. What can I really do? I am very tired and I want to change my life (I can't afford a therapist + sorry for my English).;I have read a lot of books and research about childhood trauma and how to deal with it, but change i;Content Warning: Violence;0;1;2024-04-17 04:29:11;2024-04-17;Wednesday;04:29:11;1819;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:23.655519

1c60fiv;Is it selfish for me to want to leave my hometown to go off to college?;certifiedbpdqueen;Hey everyone, I’m new to this sub, and I just really need some advice, so if you have any time, please please read this and give me some advice if you can. So, I’m currently 19 years old and I’ll be graduating with my AA degree from the community college in my hometown in a couple weeks. I live in California, and I applied to a ton of UC’s and CSU’s, and I recently found out I got accepted to San Diego State University. I love love San Diego and SDSU is a great school and perfect for my major, plus it’s much less expensive than the UC’s here in Cali. San Diego is about a 4 hour drive from where I currently live, so it’s not super far away, considering that I had actually previously wanted to go all the way to the east coast for college. However, my family and I went through a very traumatic and terrible experience about six months ago. (Trigger warning for this next part). In October of last year, my brother unalived himself. He was only 24, and he had depression and bipolar disorder. To make matters worse, he did it in the early morning while me and my parents were awake and getting ready for the day (he still lived at home with us and he did it in his room which is right next to mine). Before this, I was super motivated and excited to get as far away as possible from my hometown and transfer to a university because I have been working my ass off at my current community college, and my GPA is a 3.9, something that was not an easy thing to do, especially with my brother’s passing last semester. Now that I have gotten into SDSU, I want to go extremely badly, but I feel like it would be so selfish to just leave my parents here while I chase my dreams in light of our situation. I’m all that my parents have left because my brother was my only sibling, and I feel so conflicted. I love my family more than anything, but I’ve worked so hard to get into a great university, and I just don’t know what to do. I know you guys don’t know me and im a total stranger, but I would really appreciate any advice.

1c60akk;Mental Health state (sorry for the rambling 🙏);minning_lord;So I'm at a point where I don't know what going on with my mental health. For many months now I've been tormented by intrusive thoughts. Ill list them in orderD.I.D  Brain Cancer  Schizophrenia  Brain Cancer  PsychosisTo many, this might not make sense But this is a list of everything my mind has tried to convince me I have. The first one made me feel like my brain was gonna split in two because of the stress, anxiety, and fear. Brain cancer made me think that all prior and future stuff was because of it. Schizophrenia started due to my fear of it and began full-blown after I saw the reflection of my eye in my glasses thinking it was some kind of hallucination. Psychosis started simply due to nothing bad happening in my brain so it thought I had gone insane or something like that. I don't exhibit any symptoms of these only the general ones and that is just for brain cancer. As far As I know, I think I've hallucinated twice and both were when I was half asleep so idk. My brain feels weird now. I don't feel like myself, Like I've disconnected from my personality which might be due to depersonalization. But I fear with all that has happened I might have formed one of them idk. I don't want to have Schizophrenia and no one in my family has it (hispanic btw). Past few weeks my mind has kept thinking whatever weird shape in the corner of my eye is a hallucination. Now stress feels so distant, I feel like if I show that level of stress again I might faint or something.  My mind feels so distracted, like I'm not even present like I've become some puppet with no puppeteer.

The thing that makes this different is that this yearning seems to be dark, like it wants to fill the yearning with the harming of others. I brush it off now and don't care until I lay in bed at night. The thing I fear is when I can not push it away anymore. So if anyone has any suggestions for what to do before something like that happens, please comment and give me your ideas. Thanks.";So to start this off I'm just a regular guy in grade 9 and I have a pretty decent life.

1c607we;What is this called? ;Mandarin_Lumpy_Nutz;I don’t mean to sound super cringey with all that I’m about to say. I’ve never really told anybody this. According to my husband, (and I agree with him), I refuse to lose in a physical challenge so much so though I willingly let myself be hurt or will hurt others in an attempt to keep from losing. I’m not particularly strong and so I feel like it’d be rather easy to take me down, however, I refuse to do so without it leading to the death. I don’t care if it hurts or kills me and I don’t care if it hurts or kills them. I never back down and have always had others back down because they realized I wouldn’t surrender. Then they stare at me like I’m insane. Especially if they were play fighting,  I don’t understand how to play fight. I can only ever take it seriously. And I always take it too far which makes people mad at me. In my mind, I see no point in fighting unless the end goal is for one of them to die in the end. Once you’ve decided to attack me is the moment I assume it’s to the death. 🤷‍♀️However, I don’t get into fights and I’m not a violent person I don’t think. But my husband believes this is a point of concern as I sometimes also have HI. I am currently in therapy. Is this important enough that I should mention this to my therapist? Also, what is this called? Is it a potential sign of ASPD? Or something else?;I don’t mean to sound super cringey with all that I’m about to say.

1c605ay;Moved a lot as a kid, is anyone experiencing the same thing as me?;livblackthorn;I know this is long, but please read this if you’ve moved a lot as a kid.I was 9 years old when my family moved for the first time. I was so blindsided by it, and I couldn’t understand why we were leaving. We lived in a small town, surrounded by a great community. I grew up in a neighborhood full of kids, I went to school with all the same people, and I was happy. My dad had a great job and my mom stayed home with my brother and I. I didn’t get why we left.My dad got a better job opportunity that moved us across the country to new jersey. I was so resistant at first. I fought against it, was as spiteful as I could be as a people pleasing nine year old. But eventually I started to like it. I made really good friends and i started to appreciate change. we stayed for 4 years before we left again, this time to canada. I was sad, but at that point I still was pretty spiteful about having to leave my hometown at all. so i was eager to go.the year in canada was awful. I was 13 and really severely depressed. I went to school, i went to my sport, and i came back home to sleep and do it again the next day. i felt awful.there were many more moves and eventually i went to a boarding school in 10th grade to be able to have a stable high school experience. I made the best friends of my life there, my actual second family. we lived together, we ate together, we went to class together.I am in college now and all i can think about are the people i left behind. i dont even think it impacts them anymore. they probably dont think about me. but its ruining my life. i still cry about them, about missing them. i don’t even know if its about them or the feeling i got being around them. but it won’t stop, it’s all i think about. i don’t even know what to do about it at this point. it’s been years. and i still feel like im 12, being forced to leave those i care about over and over again, only for them to move on and forget me. it’s like im grieving people who are still alivethe reason im writing this is partly to vent, but mostly to see if anyone is experiencing the same thing. i have never met anyone with the same feelings and i just need someone to understand;I know this is long, but please read this if you’ve moved a lot as a kid.I was 9 years old when my f;Need Support;2;1;2024-04-17 03:48:02;2024-04-17;Wednesday;03:48:02;2173;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:24.748352

1c5z7ek;Why do I constantly convince myself that I look like a pedophile?;SnooEpiphanies7581;"Ok so I guess I should start with some background to get the full picture so- I'm 23M and have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and have had self-harm and addiction issues. It's also heavily speculated that I'm autistic by other autistics and such but I've not been officially tested. I currently work as an ABA therapist for children usually around 5-10 years old but I'm currently only working with one client because I'm newer.I feel extremely uncomfortable trying to explain this to anyone because I'm afraid it'll be taken the wrong way and further prove my case. But, I've had these consistent paranoid thoughts while I work with my client. It happens more often while I'm changing him when I try to assist him in becoming independent in the bathroom and if I make any sort of physical contact with them.I worry that I'm a pedophile without being fully aware of it or that I look like a pedophile to others. As soon as anything happens that triggers it I feel extreme guilt and questions echo through my head. ""Am I touching him in a way that looks weird? Is this somehow sexual? Why are you looking at him at all when he's on the toilet? Are you staring too long?"" And nothing is happening. He once sat on my leg and I was praying his mom wouldn't come in and I assume she's going to yell at me and kick me out of her home. I feel with my borderline it's even harder because I generally have no trust in myself because of how impulsive I am. I feel like I can never say that I wouldn't do something that's reckless or dangerous. I'm just one slip-up away from being a terrible person just from the lack of care of anything besides the adrenaline. So, if I think I'm somehow a pedophile then I'm definitely a creep and I'm actually the worst person to exist.I have been groomed and taken advantage of when I was underage so maybe it's trauma? I genuinely don't know what's going on and it's very upsetting especially when I have to work with this every day. How do I deal with these thoughts? What even is this?

1c5z5pq;Assaulted During Commute To Work (NYC);TumbleweedNervous76;"In February one morning on my commute to work on the Long Island Railroad to Penn Station (NYC), while disembarking the train at Penn Station, someone shoved me hard into the wall adjacent to the door as he passed me and started yelling at me about ""running him over"", or something. I never made any contact with him whatsoever, but maybe he thought I cut him off while exiting the train, or something else that in his mind justified physically assaulting me. He then continued screaming as he proceeded to walk away from the train, and as he ascended the stairs to the LIRR concourse. I was somewhat in a state of shock and pretty much just continued walking on my way to the subway. This has been stressing me out since it happened. I've been having frequent, intrusive pangs of rage when I think about it, and I feel defensive, unsafe, and on edge whenever I'm in public or on my commute now.    What should I have done? I feel like I failed because I should have defended myself or reacted with a proportionate response, but I didn't. What should I do now? If this person was readily willing to attack an able-bodied 30-something year old, who's to say they wouldn't be willing to assault an old or disabled person for no reason?

1c5ysi7;I've been self-loathing for a long time and I find it extremely hard to stop myself. Any advice?;EstelaStardust;Hello, before I talk a bit more about this I wanted to mention that I'm new and I've only ever posted once in this website, that time people called me unsensitve for choosing a wrong subreddit to talk about a diferent issue. I don't want to come across as rude or unsensitive again in this post so if I do please know it was not my intention. Also english is my second lenguage in case I make any spelling mistakes.  So... for a while now I've been self-loathing (though I didn't really know how it was called for a long time) and I feel genuenly stupid and useless every time I say something dumb or make a mistake. I know it's not a big deal at the end of the day, and a mistake won't be the end of the world but it feels like nothing I ever do is good enough. And it doesn't matter how much people tell me I'm smart and talented I feel like it's all lies and that they don't really know how much of a dissapointment I am. Logically, I know it's not true, but I still feel like maybe I'm not who they think I am and that if they were to know the bad side of me they would hate me. It's specially bad when they say a comment that would be normal in their own context where I would have no reason to find it triggering but it just fuels my insecurities to a point where I have to supress tears.(For context, I'm not very open with my emotions ever since I was young, I don't tend to cry in public unless it's extreme and I know it's a bad habit so it might be contributing with this.)In the last year or two it started to get worse so I decided I needed to do something about it. Lately I've been trying to be more positive and not think so badly of myself but it's been really hard and every time my mom gets angry about me doing some task wrong (she's not even remotely violent just to clarify, it's mainly just my own head making me feel horrible for making a mistake again) it just comes flodding back in. And it's hard to stop myself from thinking I'm worthless because of the stupidest mistakes, I just want to feel better because I feel like I'm exagerating!Like, that's a whole deal, I keep feeling the clasic ''well others have it worse, so why are you attention seeking'' and I KNOW I'm not attention seeking because I haven't even told anyone until now but I have no idea how to stop thinking that way. I want to heal for the right reasons, not because others have it worse but it feels like I've hit a bit of a wall with this and I was hoping you guys could give me some advice.Thank you for reading <3;Hello, before I talk a bit more about this I wanted to mention that I'm new and I've only ever poste;Venting;0;1;2024-04-17 02:38:00;2024-04-17;Wednesday;02:38:00;2514;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:50.696072
1c5yse6;If you are physically ugly (ik, subjective), and you get obsessed with it, is it also body dysmorphia?;elisamorenoo;"Hello! I hope it doesn't sound stupid or whatever but I've been wondering. I know physical beauty it's something subjective many times, though we tend to agree about some things about beauty every now and then with other people, it's still very subjective and it can be impressive how some things to some people may be beautiful while for others it isn't.But, that being said. If a person it's kind of objectively ugly, sort of speak of course, but has different things that are considered ugly and blabla, that person can also have body dysmorphia if they becomes obsessed about it? Because, I've read the description of the disorder and some of it says like ""sees oneself with a certain feature that is bigger/smaller/whatever than it really is"". But what happens when the person actually has something that looks like that person says, and it's not just a perception thing? It's still body dysmorphia? If it's actually there?Body dysmorphia can be both maybe? When you see things that aren't, and also, when you become obsessed about things that actually are there but it's an insane obsession?Also, well. I feel like I'm suffering from this. And I feel like that thing where I'm becoming obsessed with things that actually are there -like, Im not imagining anything and its not perceptual-, but it's becoming insane.For example, I look myself in a mirror and I actually like what I see, but I feel cheated, as what I see in the mirror, it's not what I see in pictures/videos. That thing that we see ourselves reflected in mirrors it's a bummer. And I'm hating in an insane way how I see myself sometimes (sometimes because there are times there's a good picture, luckily) on pictures and videos. Like a big horror. So I think I suffer from body dysmorphia, but I want to know if it's also considered that when you actually see yourself as you are, physically speaking.Now, the next step is try to accept the ugliness I think, but I'm having a hard time on that. I hope it'll come with time, I think it will. As feeling sad for being ugly is kind of tiring too. Emotionally tiring, I mean, I'm really starting to kill myself emotionally in this sense and it needs to stop, because it's getting sickening.Thanks for reading, I've been having a hard time with this recently, and I needed to ask and talk about it.🫂🫂";Hello!

1c5xt55;How to reconcile with the absolutely terrible things I've done in the past?;cicatrize-;"I grew up with untreated mentally illness, and it manifested in a way that made me extremely reactive, sensitive, manipulative, and abusive. I destroyed all of my close relationships and I just wasn't a very good person to be around in general. And when I added alcohol to the mix (which I often did) my destructive behaviour would increase tenfold. Due to medication, therapy, life experience, and growth I could say that I have changed and I'm a relatively stable person at the moment that has a job, a couple of friends, and a pretty peaceful life. But I can't love myself (which seems to be crucial to the next stage of growth I'm trying to progress into), I can't forgive myself, and I just can't move on. Everyday I remember a new way I've hurt someone, and I can't enter into close, deep, vulnerable relationships for fear of doing it again. I intrinsically believe I am a bad person deep down and people would be better off without me. I feel like this 'new' me is just an act that everyone can see right through, and that the world knows my true insidious, disgusting nature. I don't feel like the things I've done should be forgiven, and if someone I love told me that they had done the same things I had my feelings would change about them. I'm terrified of death because I don't want to face eternal judgement, but at the same time I don't feel like I'm worthy of life. I just... float through things now trying not to negatively impact anything around me. I desperately just want to be a good person. I want to be worthy of good things, and make a positive impact in the world. I want a best friend and a partner that feel loved and respected by me and love me just the same. I want to help people and be happy and accept myself. But how can I when I've done unforgivable things? How can I move past something that will forever be a scar for someone else? It feels... selfish, cowardly, unaccountable to try and move on; I believe I deserve to be punished, but at the same time I am so so tired of living this way. I've searched for answers for this before, and I always find content by someone feeling shame because they had a little fight with their friend and can't forgive themselves (or something to that nature). And it seems obvious that they should learn from this and move on because a good person can still make mistakes. But what I've done wasn't a mistake, it was a consistent pattern of terrible choices that for years I held no remorse for. I've stolen, cheated, abused, intimidated, assaulted.

I'm 28 I've never felt loved by anyone (not even my family) people just use me and then throw me away. I'm so tired of not having anyone, no friends, family, a partner. I feel myself crying inside but I can't let anything out I can't let go. If I do nobody will help me pick up the pieces. I just don't want to get up anymore. My mother only wants money from me. I got injured when someone rear-ended the car I was a passenger in. I got whiplash now my left arm, neck, shoulder, and face are numb and hurting constantly. I gat a little money from insurance and my mother was upset I gave her 500 from it becuse she wanted 1-2k.   I had to get injured to get that little bit of money. She doesn't care. I tell her I'm In pain she makes up her face at me and then complains about her pain which was her fault. I'm just so tired of her and everyone using me My last ex only ever told me he loved me when he was nearly black out drunk. My sisters use me for cheap/free labour. I don't make much money. I can't afford a car, I can barely drive with the neck injury. I don't even have my license yet either and my mother and 3 sisters all have cars and won't let me practice until I have my license. I can't get in a car with out a panic attack sometimes becuse of the car anxiety after the person who rear-ended the car I was in. There's so much hurt in me and I know it all sounds shallow and superficial, but that cause it's just the little bit of pain at my surface. So many awful things have happened and I have no way of working through my hurt. Getting raped, my father trying to have us kicked out on the street, the physical and emotional abuse growing up, just so much. I'm so tired and I don't see much to be happy about.

1c5xhan;paranoia/delusions about being watched by family;jeongtoot;"all of this is going to sound really fucked up and its is extremely hard for me to talk about but i need to preface this by saying that my dad has NEVER done anything abusive towards me. i understand that a lot of this reads like i've been sexually abused or something as a child but i haven't. please don't say anything about subconscious trauma, bc i assure you it's not possible. i didn't even live with my dad for a large period of time as a child.  i also never felt like my dad looked at me inappropriately or thought about me in any way other than as a little kid. i've also never really had any mental health issues until this whole thing started.   in december of 2022, during my final exams of that term, i'm not really sure why or what triggered it but i began experiencing a psychotic break. tbh im not even sure if thats what it was, but essentially, i began freaking out and accusing my dad of watching me through hidden cameras in my room and bathroom. we thought it was just the stress of my exams but these thoughts never went away even after the exams ended. in fact they got much worse as time went on. i began imagining my dad monitoring my texts with friends, listening into my phone calls and watching me through the camera of my phone and laptop. i started deluding myself that he could track my location because of the devices i always carry on me and that he could see me via cameras that were hidden in the cracks of my walls. the worst is the bathroom - i felt like he could watch me showering or using the bathroom.   i don't have any reason for why he would ever WANT to do any of these things. prior to this, we had an absolutely normal father-daughter relationship and i had never imagined my dad being capable of any of this. it's just the awful, pervasive thought of ""what if he is, though?"". the feeling of being watched, made me slowly stop doing everything i enjoyed. it was absolutely debilitating. i couldn't reply to a text without wondering if my dad would be alerted of it and read my entire chat. i couldn't change my clothes without wondering if he could see me. i couldn't shower, and so i didn't. i would shower at late hours of the night when i was sure he was asleep. and even then i felt as though he could rewind the recording caught by the cameras in my bathroom and watch them later. i didn't shower for months at a time. when i thought back to all the times i had done things in private in my room and imagined my dad being able to see those things, i genuinely wanted to die. i felt disgusted even looking at myself in the mirror for a long time. it's not just the feeling of being watched that was bothering me. it was because it was my DAD that it felt disgusting. quite honestly i wouldn't give a single fuck if it was some random hacker watching me. as i did more research about hidden cameras and spyware/malware (ex. WebWatcher), i became more convinced because i realized all these things were actually possible.   things started to get a little better when i moved out of my family house. my parents were able to see how much i was suffering and i convinced them that this was the only way i could begin to move on. instead of getting rid of the thoughts of my dad monitoring me, i've just sorta learned to function/cohabitate with them. i started normalizing the fact that i would change my clothes in the dark corner of my closet as quickly as i humanly could. that i instinctively cover my phone camera and audio receiver when i'm chatting with friends. i still only shower like once a week bc i can't put myself through more than that. i can enjoy the things i used to enjoy but i still feel as though my dad can watch me in my apartment and through the cameras of my devices. i call my parents every night to say goodnight, but everytime i'm talking to my dad, i look too far into what he says as evidence of my delusions. he could say something like ""we bought new x for the bathroom shower"" and it'll keep me up for hours wondering how he knew i had showered that day and if it was his way of taunting me that he knew. sometimes i'll test him and say i'm at home when i'm really not, just to gauge his response. while i do constantly test him, i'm also terrified that he'll say something to confirm my fears, because i don't have a game plan for what to do if any of this is actually true. i can't invite friends over to my place or spend the night at anyone else's because the whole time i feel like he can listen in. i can't imagine even texting or dating someone new, i don't think i'll even be able to get married or have a normal sexual relationship if this continues. i'm not on medication but i did see a psychiatrist who had me take a small dose of olanzapine and I also went to a few therapy sessions but ultimately nothing worked or made these thoughts permanently go away. i feel like i'm going to be stuck in this awful mindset until either i die or my dad does - which is a horrible, fucked up thing to say, i know - but thats how it feels.   for some background info, i've actually always been very close with my dad and before all this, i would've trusted him with my life. i still would, because other than for this matter he's still the first person i go to when i need something. i'm an only child and i've lived with my dad since i was 14, he basically raised me as a single parent bc my mom was stuck in another country due to immigration issues. tbh i think the reason all of this bothers me to the extent it does is because of how much i trust him, because this would be the utmost betrayal of my trust and love for him. he's always done a lot for me and the fact that i'm having these awful twisted delusions and he's at the centre of them makes me feel so much guilt and disgust that i genuinely hate myself. i know he adores me and the fact that i'm causing a rift in our relationship because of my mental illness is killing me.";all of this is going to sound really fucked up and its is extremely hard for me to talk about but i ;Venting;0;1;2024-04-17 01:34:47;2024-04-17;Wednesday;01:34:47;5921;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:24.814694

Sorry for the testament but I think everything here is relevant.Ages: Me (M) 26; She (F) 19A bit of context:I joined uni for my second career due to bad job opportunities I couldn't find a single one as a pilot I tried everywhere in my country every even in the most remote aerodrome I couldn't find one I'm currently studying to become Chem E. We are currently (sadly) just friends.Actual story/issue:So let's start when I first saw her I my first thought was ""I hope I never have to interact with her"" but as soon as I started talking to her I've realized we have A LOT of things in common and started finding her more and more gorgeous (one of her outfits was probably the prettiest one I've ever seen any girl) so we started talking and talking and talking and eventually our trust on each other grew very fast.So we had a ton of beautiful talks about our life, expectations, love life, etc. We are basically just missing sexual stuff. I've already discover how to know her mood it's in the subtle things when she alright/good she has an amazing shine/glow on her eyes and do tons of eye contact (with me) and also she looks for a reason to touch me, when she's sad/ things aren't alright the shine is gone, the eye contact is non existent and the physical touch is gone. So she had a bf (she lasted 3 weeks was with him only once and the only thing they did was 1 single fast kiss) an extremely bad one and thanks to my advice she learned what's a healthy relationship and how to respect herself a bit more and broke things up with him.Turns out when I told her that if she goes out with him (or any guy really) our relationship will change so she said yes to him and obviously our relationship changed I had to put some limits regarding certain stuff and stopped doing certain things and her glow slowly died I'm not entirely sure if it was due our change in relationship or due to her ""bf"" (I'm pretty sure it was due to our change in relationship). And started uploading sad/depressive sentences every other day on her Instagram.Well she broke up things with the dude during Saturday, during Monday she was pretty good but today she was a mess (she looked stunning as pretty much always) but her spark was dead beyond repair, eye contact was gone and touching was gone and she uploaded an extremely sad/depressive story on her insta that raised my awareness to the max. Now what should I do? I'm seeing her tomorrow and I'm thinking that after class pretty much force her (if necessary) to talk in private and mention pretty much everything I just wrote ""about her spark and how I know how's she even when she doesn't wanna tell me"".";"Hello guys!

It's... a little hard to describe.Now, mind you I do have intrusive thoughts, plenty in fact and i'm trying my best not to engage with them, but these are different. Normally these specific thoughts are a random sentence that I for some reason imagine, or snippets of a song, or a random memory. It's different to my internal monologue in that I don't intentionally call these thoughts.Doing some Googling a few hours ago, I came across the term ""mind pops"", and they seem to exactly fit my description, but i'm not sure if a mind pop is just in relation to memories or not, as opposed to general random thoughts that may or may not be memories, as i seem to be getting conflicting answers.I guess i'm just asking this because i'm curious if this is normal/if they are mind pops or if it's in relation to the intrusive thoughts i've been having that got particularly bad around late 2020 and at their worst in 2021.

1c5w3st;How is this thing I'm experiencing called? Hyperfixation?;collaredfairy;So, I have BPD (diagnosed) and some other symptoms that are usually related to other disorders (a bit of OCD, a bit of ADHD), but I always tie them to BPD/being neurotic & anxious in general, so no other diagnoses.Aside from having long-term interests, I am prone to having 'fixations'. Usually it's something really small and niche, and will last from hours to weeks. Some examples are: a certain diving bell accident (now I know every last detailed about it, down to the names of victims' children), a small personal scene from dnd game I'm playing rn (I'm all about this scene for a month already I literally cannot sleep), 3d printing (gone in several hours), a specific esoteric practice (gone in several weeks), a song (I literally shaped a part of my life after this song for a period of time)...

1c5w20z;I feel like I've been misdiagnosed, but no one listens;newtsdaisies;I'm not asking for anyone to diagnose me or anything, I just guess I'm really wanting to know if others have been in this position and what they did.For some context, I feel like I've been depressed/anxious my whole life. I've had some particularly traumatic experiences that caused me to develop ptsd later on too, all three of which I've received treatment for.I started therapy + meds nearly seven years ago. I went through, in that time, seven therapists as well all of which left the job except for one who I switched from because I was uncomfortable seeing a male therapist. For those entire 7 years, I saw a psychiatrist as well and have been on ~10 medications from different 'families' of drugs. Most of which I had allergic reactions to (head-to-toe hives) or caused bad side effects. Around 3-4 years ago (please forgive me, I have a really hard time with conceptualizing the passage of time and am terrible at giving exact amounts of time between events) I was put on a pair of medications that helped for a little while and then after about a year I was back in a terrible place mentally where they weren't helping at all.I went back to the psych and we tried something else, it had side affects, and then she straight up told me she has one more thing to try and if that didn't work there was nothing else she could do for me and that was... really devastating to hear. She told me that I had treatment-resistant depression and when I, in tears, asked her what that meant I was supposed to do, she kind of sarcastically told me to try electro-shock therapy if this didn't work out.Thankfully, she put me on cymbalta + wellbutrin together and for again, near a year, I was doing better and better. I finally had a great therapist who actually listened to me and helped me and then about 2 years into having therapy with her, I felt like I was in a place where I wasn't gaining anything more from therapy and she was also leaving the job.That was five months ago.Currently I'm back to where I was the first time my meds stopped working. I can't function, I can't focus, I'm up and down constantly and the downs are always intense.I currently no longer see the psychiatrist because she already said there's nothing she can do for me and I also had a lot of issues with the way she treated me so I had my PCP start filling my medications. The more I reflect on everything, the more I feel like I was never listened to. I brought up many times that I felt like therapy / meds weren't quite working because I felt there was a bigger issue going on and even told two of my therapists early on that I felt like I was suffering with bipolar disorder. Both immediately brushed it off without questioning me on anything or even asking why I felt that way and they were my first two therapists, after that I never felt comfortable to bring it up again.Because of these experiences, there were a lot of things trauma-wise that I never brought up to ANY other therapists until my last therapist and even still I was too afraid to open up about my ED with her.Now I'm in a situation where I have nowhere to go and no one I can see because I'm currently unemployed (no money and no insurance) and have not been able to get hired in the past 4 months even though I have applied to 100+ jobs (I wish I was kidding) which as you can imagine isn't helping anything. I can go back to the place I was before but the only psychiatrist that works there is the one  who already said straight up there was nothing else she could do for me and that she was giving up on me and I really don't want to play therapist roulette there again either because they literally CANNOT keep anyone working there. There are no other 'sliding scale' or 'low cost' mental health clinics anywhere near me as I live in the middle of nowhere.I'm at a loss at what to do, I feel unheard and unseen, and I just feel really exhausted. It feels like I've been fighting a battle for nearly three decades that I just cannot win no matter how hard I try. Does anyone have any suggestions or even just similar stories that relate?

1c5w0ae;"Does anyone else who's recovered sometimes miss the ""drama"" of mental illness?";knockdownthewall;"I've been steadily improving for the past few years now. I definitely am glad for it, of course - everything in my life is so much better and easier now I don't feel like there's a ticking time bomb in my head ready to sabotage me. Sometimes though - perhaps it's my self destructive side - I miss the intensity of being mentally ill.When I was at my most mentally unwell, I was constantly oscillating between extreme euphoria and suicidality. Everything came in extremes and was incredibly overwhelming, but was also incredibly vibrant and... inspiring maybe? Sometimes when I'm doing something that makes me happy, I think ""this would feel better if I was still like that"". Of course it's not the same for the bad parts - every day I'm grateful I don't get the bad parts anymore - but even then there's that bit of a kind of poisonous draw of feeling something that intensely, even if it's negative. Everything was incredibly melodramatic, and had its own kind of beauty and romanticism because of that. I could just unpredictably burst into a drug-like euphoria for no reason, and that kind of state of mind makes it possible to appreciate things in a way which isn't possible otherwise.To reiterate, I am definitely glad to be better and I don't feel like I'm lacking in anything significant. Stability - genuine stability - is something worth waiting and working for. It's more of a thought I entertain sometimes.

1c5vbdm;Why am I addicted to overworking myself to the extreme?;Spirited-Cobbler-154;"Quick disclaimer: after typing this all out I realise how utterly ridiculous it sounds. But I want to stress that I’m not making this up or “trolling”. This is very real and I’m really in need of insights, advice and support. End of disclaimer. So, I have a remote job helping to build an online start-up. I work from home on my laptop. I don't have set working hours. I just work on the never-ending list of tasks, from creating products, planning content, writing copy, etc, etc. The day-to-day expectation is that I get through as much as I can in a day, and then pick up again tomorrow.But the thing is, there's nobody forcing me to stop working, so I could just keep going if I wanted to.  And that's what I do. Every day. And every night... What I do is work through the entire day, the entire night, entire next day, entire next night, entire next day, until usually on the 3rd night I pass out from exhaustion/sleep deprivation, I sleep around 16 hours, and then repeat the cycle.There is absolutely no reason for me to do this. There are no tight deadlines to meet, and there is no monetary incentive for it. I get a flat monthly pay. No bonuses, overtime, or extra pay at all. To my awareness, the only reason I do this is because I am obsessed - like honestly intoxicated - with the feeling of being extremely overworked, sleep-deprived,  and burnt out.The job itself carries none of my obsession. I could take it or leave it. I know this because when I am well-rested and recovered, I don't feel any sort of way about the work I do. I am averagely productive with it, and averagely focused on it. However, when it crosses over to the early hours of the morning - 3, 4, 5am - the obsession has taken over. My body and mind feel like a wreck from working relentlessly through the night, and that feeling is intoxicating. Somehow it fuels me to lock in even harder on my work, and really truck away at my tasks with hyper-focus. It's then a bit like a feedback loop: The longer I do this, the more overworked and sleep-deprived I get, the more intoxicating it feels, the more that feeling fuels me to lock in even harder.I would like to add that on that first day of the cycle, after waking up feeling normal and rested, I am ""normal"" - as in, I shower, eat my 2-3 meals, pop out to the cafe over lunch, chat to the friendly cafe regulars, take park walk breaks from work, etc. But from that first night onwards, I will work through my hunger until I feel utterly starving, run to the 24h shop by my house, scoff down some quick sustenance and dash back home to work. That will be the only circumstance under which I step away from work for the rest of my time awake.And if you are wondering why on the first day - when I am seemingly in my right mind - would I even continue to work through that first night; it’s because I can’t help myself. I know those euphoric feelings of obsession and intoxication are coming if I just keep working. And I know they won’t happen if I go to stop working and just go to sleep.So this is where I’m at. I’m puzzled. I don’t know the reason behind these feelings. I do have a suspicion that it may be ego-driven. As if the obsession is with my own ability to keep working to this extreme extent. But I don’t know for sure. Any insights, perspectives, advice or support is greatly appreciated.";Quick disclaimer: after typing this all out I realise how utterly ridiculous it sounds.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression but it was never severe enough to where it affected me being able to work, etc. I guess it may have to do with a lot of moving parts happening in my life. Got laid off from my last job about 3-4 weeks ago, am moving out of my apartment around the same time, and just started a new job this past Monday that I feel I might be a little underqualified for, which is def adding to the anxiety.Anyways, I woke up this past Monday morning and I immediately started doing this little dry gag/cough/throw-up thing that I do when I get anxiety. But I never actually throw up. Both yesterday morning and this morning, I threw up and was (sorry for the tmi) having anxious poops as well. The past two mornings I’ve woken up with an overwhelming feeling of existential dread and hopelessness. I used to get this feeling as a kid, but hadn’t felt it in a longgggggg time. I also have barely been able to eat or even keep anything down, to the point where I feel like I might pass out. It’s so exhausting. The anxiety is almost taking a more physical toll on me than a mental one. I guess I’m asking is, how do y’all cope? What are some things I can do to try to prevent myself from spiraling? Both in the moment and maybe preventative actions for the future? Should I start drinking relaxing teas in the morning and evening? Should I go on a run when I feel an attack coming on?

1c5uxng;Out of a two year train wreck of a relationship I still pine for…feeling relief and excitement about new partners but also deep sadness and longing for my ex;redpurloin;"This is going to be a very long read, so I thank all the readers who stick it out until the end. Three people will be mentioned in this retelling: me, my ex-partner, and their primary partner. No one in this story is a monster, and I’m not intending that my readers should think as much. All three of us have terrible traumas which have resulted in us becoming stunted, imperfect individuals who are probably still growing up and finding ourselves. Each person involved in this story has a litany of sexual traumas and unhappy childhoods, all of which influences our relationship behaviors. Though I don’t feel at liberty to discuss the sensitive subject of either EXP’s or WF’s traumatic background, I can go into more detail about my own. Dramatis PersonaeEXP: my ex-partner, (AFAB NB, ~35)WF: EXP’s primary partner, the “Wife” (F ~30) And Me: see belowI’m a neurodivergent, autistic non-binary AMAB woman in my mid 30s, over educated, autodidactic bibliophile. Translation: I read way too many books (mostly non fiction) and don’t easily form human relationships because interpersonal relationships baffle me. I spend a lot of my spare time in the gym working out because I’m physically hyperactive, and I’m also chronically anxious, bordering on paranoid, and exercise is one of only a couple tried and tested outlets I know of for getting this out. I was sexually assaulted as a child, my parents split when I wasn’t yet a teenager, and I was raised mostly by my mother, kind of an arch conservative, pull yourself up by your bootstraps immigrant, and a tiger mom at that, who moved my siblings and I out of the country, and I returned stateside later, to go to college, and I’ve been here ever since. Later on in my late twenties, while I was in college, my father died a premature death after I had stopped returning his calls. He was not yet even of retirement age. What this means is that I am, in EXP’s words, self-centered and codependent in my relationships, and I have a deathly fear of abandonment which means my relationship partners often find me suffocating, and that I care more about preserving my romantic relationships and being soothed by my partners than I do about my partners themselves. Instead of taking care of my mental health and relying on a therapist to help me with these issues, I rely on my partners to do the impossible task of soothing my many disorders. I have been known to make unwelcome texts and phone calls, basically bombarding my partners with too much communication and then accusing them of withholding affection when they don’t reciprocate my level of attachment. So, as I relate what the other people in this story are doing, please take into account the way I am using EXP as a surrogate therapist, and a source of the parental or maternal affection I never received growing up. I (AMAB NB~35) am feeling a mixture of intense pining and relief. I broke up with my partner EXP (AFAB NB ~35) of 2+ years on Friday or Saturday. Today EXP seemed to tell me off for good, writing a parting indictment of my flaws on the message app we use and then blocking me, which is the same way we broke up for the first time 6 months ago, after which EXP asked me to take them back. EXP and I both had problems and I want to be as unsparing of myself as I am of them. It’s important for me to mention at the beginning that I come to any relationship with a series of traumas from my childhood and my early adulthood which still influence me and affect the kind of partner I am in relationships. I was sexually assaulted when I was a child, my parents split when I was not yet a teenager (I lived with my mother thereafter and she moved my siblings and I to another country) and later my father died (a relatively young man, he was not yet retirement age) shortly after I refused to take his calls anymore. You can read above how this influences my own behavior.  This relationship began quite disastrously from the jump, yet for reasons I’ll get into below I was mesmerized by EXP and addicted to them from the moment we exchanged messages on the app where we met. We bonded over the fact that we were somewhat reticent and antisocial  neurodivergent millennials with way too much education. EXP has a background in psychology and so taught me a lot of things I didn’t understand about why people are as they are, and why I was the way I was. EXP also gave me the first acceptance and kindness I had ever known as a trans person who was learning later in life that I was a woman. EXP provided me my first encouragement, to explore transitioning and dressing according to my identity. We both had a history of therapy as children, because our schools didn’t know what to do with us; we were above average in intelligence but suffered from all sorts of behavioral problems. We learned as adults that we were autistic but that the autism spectrum wasn’t well understood when we were kids and so we kind of slipped the net. They and I led pretty identical young adulthoods. We each did an extra year of high school because we were underachievers who didn’t like going to school and facing the bullies and other pressures there. We both started college in our twenties but didn’t finish until our early thirties because of our handicap and a lot of the same issues. So naturally for these reasons and many other startling similarities we had this sense of being kindred spirits from the moment we got to know one another. My partner even resided in the city where I was born and grew up (I now live in another state) and so being with them had this strangely providential feeling, like I was getting back to where it all began.So needless to say we were long distance partners falling fast for one another. Because we were both broke (I from paying tuition and EXP had student loan debt) I’d make the multi-hour drive out to the state where EXP lived, because it was cheaper than buying plane tickets. When we got together EXP told me offhandedly that they had a primary partner—WF (F~30, who they would later refer to as their Wife in virtually all conversations with me, as a way of asserting hierarchy)—and that they had been experimenting with poly relationships. The first thing EXP told me about her was that they ‘just lived together and kissed sometimes.’ They told me that it wasn’t going so well and that EXP and WF were on the verge of breaking up imminently. It turns out that, though they had many problems, that wasn’t the case at all, and that in our first month together I was already being misled about what I was getting involved in. I soon learned that years before I and EXP had ever met, WF—had been engaged to marry EXP and that the arrangement fell apart when WF had gotten cold feet and wanted to call it off. The stillborn nuptial was quietly swept under a rug and thereafter EXP still referred to WF as “my wife.” So, to many people, like EXP’s parents and family members, EXP and WF were for all intents and purposes married, if not legally so. And I was the secret partner who was not allowed to meet the family, or friends of the family, lest that embarrassing secret become common knowledge. Stranger still, though WF had given EXP permission to pursue primarily sexual encounters, she was adamant that EXP could not pursue romantic relationships. But when my partner and I started falling for one another, all that blew up and before long I was having to apologize to WF and beg her to let me stay in a relationship with EXP. From then on, I learned that WF was jealous of EXP and had developed a nascent sexual attraction to me. This was always very strange to me since WF claimed to be more attracted to masculinity than femininity, and I identify as a non-binary woman who still has some male parts. I’m athletic because I’m anxious and hyperactive, and exercise is one of the only proven outlets I have for my anxiety, so I think as a consequence of my having a well developed physique, WF had grown jealous of EXP’s relationship with me. WF on the other hand was unhealthy and out of shape, and so I never physically fancied her. But before I knew it, EXP was telling me that I was only still around because of WF’s goodwill, the implication being that we had to sweeten this arrangement for WF. Sooner or later I was being nudged and maneuvered by EXP into entering a poly triad with WF that I never wanted to be in, in order to placate WF and keep her interested enough in letting me stay with EXP. It started with threesomes and gradually evolved into WF and I alone, while EXP busied themselves with other distractions. I remember feeling terrified the first times I had to spend alone with WF. So if I put out sexually, WF would in essence refrain from whispering all my shortcomings in EXP’s ear and making a stink about our relationship. To add even more craziness to the triad debacle, I learned that the intimacy between EXP and WF was one sided. EXP initiated almost all sexual encounters, and that intimacy was almost never reciprocated by WF for years at a time. EXP would perform things on WF and get literally nothing in return for it. So when I did my obligatory bit to keep harmony between all three of us, EXP would get jealous and resentful that WF was initiating sexual encounters with me, and was not initiating or expressing sexual interest in EXP. When I told EXP that I didn’t even enjoy this obligation, and that I’d happily stop doing it if EXP would only say the word, EXP eviscerated me and launched into a furious tirade about how I was not allowed to suggest that WF was physically unattractive to me. This eventually came to a head one day when I was in EXP and WF’s apartment studying for school in one of the bedrooms. EXP was at work, and expecting WF and I to meet them for lunch. Before we were due to leave, I eventually dozed off on the bed under a small pile of textbooks and notebooks, and I was awakened to find WF standing over me and rubbing my chest and my face with her hand. She bent over me to kiss me and I didn’t protest at all, because of the influence WF had on EXP’s thinking. I didn’t want to say that I didn’t want this, and wind up turning both of them against me, so I consented by opening my arms, reaching up to her, and appearing to invite her toward me. And I let her do what she liked. I pretended to climax so that it would end. Afterward, because it was so exhausting, we fell asleep and missed EXP’s lunch hour. Worst of all the encounter was unprotected. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to lie to EXP about having unprotected sex. WF suggested we didn’t have to tell, but I knew that I wouldn’t be able to keep the secret and that sooner or later EXP was going to be angry with both of us. Later on that happened, as WF and I sat in the living room, with EXP venting their anger at both of us, for both the lapse, as well as the fact that we had been intimate at all, instead of meeting for lunch. When I told EXP privately that I was studying and dozing, and that sex with WF was the furthest thing from my mind at the time that it happened, they told me that they were accepting WF’s version of the story in which it was a mutually invited encounter, and told me that I was lying. I knew then that this was a toxic relationship that I should have bailed from long ago, but I was too in love and attracted to EXP, and I stayed. A lot more of this relationship was toxic and topsy turvy, but I still love EXP, and I miss being with them. If they asked to come back, I would take them enthusiastically. I’m relieved that it’s over and I can go on, but I also feel as though all the effort and time I poured into this relationship was for nothing, and that I have a hole in my heart where EXP belongs.";This is going to be a very long read, so I thank all the readers who stick it out until the end.

1c5uv23;Do I Not Have Feelings?;Heispar;I should start by saying that I can, in fact, express emotions. At times, I'm a bit too expressive with my feelings. Although, there are times when I don't express certain emotions during their time of need.An example I'll use is a group competition. My teammates are ecstatic about winning it, but on the other hand, I'm very neutral about it. I don't feel anything about the situation. Not only in this situation, there are times when I strongly admire another person--and they reciprocate--but I feel nothing. I'm not happy or jumping for joy. Over the years, I've just learned to accept it as part of my character. I just pretend that I'm as happy as my peers are feeling. It's just easier this way.I've tried to find reasons behind it, though I've found none relating to this issue(?). The only thing I can string into this situation is my ADHD, though I'm still unsure if it contributes to these feelings. I know that other people share similar feelings and issues as me, but they are unable to describe them. (They are much more worried about it than I am.)I just want to know if this is a normal thing. Is this an issue I should be truly worried about? It doesn't seem to affect me.I just need some opinions on this matter.Thanks:);I should start by saying that I can, in fact, express emotions.

1c5uumf;i need help;Low-Company8551;tw-addiction, self harmI am 16 years old and I think I might be addicted to many things but I don't have any support or anyone who can help me. I have issues with alcohol and nicotine and i know that but i'll deal with it after i fix what is my biggest issue right now which is i think i am addicted to self harm and pills. I have always loved medicine ever since i was a child and I would steal pills from my mom's medicine cabinet to take them. I loved the feeling and I still do. I couldn't control myself around medicine to the point where if I found expired medicine I would take it no matter what it was. I stopped for a while but for a few years it's been back. Back then I had less access to pills than I do now and so the problem is even worse. I can't stop myself. I take at least 2 pills a day often for pain because I am always hurting (specially my head) and pain pills have been the only thing that can stop me from hurting for years. I take so many pills that i am building immunity to their effects and now have to take at least 6 times the normal dose for my weight in order to have any effect at all. It goes beyond that however. I first ever overdosed on antidepressants at 13. I was stressed and sad and i didn't do it with the intention of killing myself but i saw all of the pills i had in my backpack and took them. it was a mix of antidepressants, pain killers, etc. i puked for days but i never told anyone until months later and i still didn't say how many pills i actually took. every time im at a really low point i just feel the need to take every pill i see and specially take them all at the same time or bite and taste them. i hate the taste of pills but i can't stop myself no matter what. today i went through a really bad emotional breakdown at school and not even an hour after i got there i took multiple antidepressants that i stole from my mom. i can't explain how sick i feel and i haven't eaten anything because i can't stop puking. all the muscles in my body hurt, light hurts, my head hurts and I haven't stopped shaking in hours. this has happened so many times before and i don't like the feeling but i can't stop myself i really can't and no one can know so no one can help me. im afraid ill never stop until i take a dose my body can't handle. i don't want to die. my hands are destroyed from me picking at them, i have scars all over my body not from cutting but from being reckless, i fucked up my lungs already, my entire life is a mess, and I am tired of living like this because i really don't want to die.;tw-addiction, self harmI am 16 years old and I think I might be addicted to many things but I don't ;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-16 23:31:55;2024-04-16;Tuesday;23:31:55;2558;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:24.850284
1c5utjb;Is there a chance I can be fixed?;LoLenjoyer75;Please read until the end, I’ve written it clear and simple. Im open to any suggestions. There is a lot of stuff wrong with me. A LOT. And for a long time I have been thinking meh theyre gonna go away, I’ll grow out of them, but no. I think theyre getting worse. I’m EXTREMELY awkward in social interaction, to that point that I dont even want to interact at all. I have trouble expressing myself. I have trouble understanding my feelings thus I suppress them or just bully myself. I dont think I’m good looking. I have some good problem solving/analysing capabilities but thats it, I’m a meh and an ignorant at everything else. I feel like a drag down to all my friends, I hate to think they help me because of pity, because I can’t help myself. I always feel a need to have a good friend, but when I get the chance to make one, i push them away because its not worth it I dont even want one. I sometimes intentionally go against the flow, to give myself some originality, but I rather make myself look stupid and weird. Don’t remember the last thing I’ve done that was fun, the only things that may be called fun i do it for pleasure and dopamine. I like monotonic and sad environments, they make me calm and peaceful. I look in the mirror and what do I see? Nothing, that is trying to be somebody, at least somebody. I have no dreams, and no real goals, I feel pointless, and yet I embrace life, and I want death to be inflicted only by it. I seek retribution and a chance to compensate for such a wasted existence. I dont know who I am, what makes me me, different from other people. Yet other people aren’t failing to be what they are, unlike me. This is all i can think of right now. I spend most of the day doing my IT job and playing videogames, at least I know I’m a bit good at something. Is there any chance for me to make it as a whole person? Or have I got a defective personality as a core, which I shall keep it a secret as long as it takes from those who unfortunately already care about me? I am jealous of the person i could have been, even tho i dont actually know who that might be. Im pathetic at this point. I seek attention by victimising myself. When I think these, I know I’m being an egomaniac thinking only about myself without thinking of those who love me. I feel… sad.;Please read until the end, I’ve written it clear and simple.

1c5uokl;I turn 20 next month and I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing. ;kenzbenz222;I went to college for welding, and every single job I’ve applied to or worked at i’ve experienced sexism and demeaning comments towards me. I get told to “joke back” and just ignore them.. which is not something I want to do. I just recently applied and got an interview for a new welding job, it was a phone interview and even over the phone the guy interviewing me made weird comments about me being a girl welder. So it makes me question if I wasted the last year of my time working towards this welding career, just for men to shit in my face about it. I really have tried to ignore the comments, but I’m sick of being demeaned. My current relationship that I have spent years of my life on is so toxic, I have no idea how to end it. I’ve been with him since i was 14. I don’t even know life without him. as we have aged we have grown a part, we have extremely different interests, we have both gone behind eachothers backs with shit and just a lot is wrong with the relationship I won’t get into it all. both of us are just to stubborn to end it, we also have a lot of love for eachother of course.. we have spent years together.

1c5tscd;OCD symptoms?;Amazing_Specialist71;my boyfriend (diagnosed w ocd) thinks i may have developed it, but i’m not sure if that works and i’m wondering if anyone here with OCD can relate to what i’m going through or offer advice? (NOT SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION/DIAGNOSIS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL AT SOME POINT). apologies for flair, wasn’t sure if this would go under question or support? i’d just like to see if anyone relates. to start with i am autistic, which i know can often accompany OCD. growing up i’ve had “quirks”, but no intrusive thoughts which i’m fairly certain are just my autistic traits. eg, - sensory issues with ‘slimy’ things, once at 12 i touched something i didn’t like and i kept feeling it on my finger despite wiping it off. leading to me scratching the skin off my finger from obsessively itching at it- i can’t have things touching me because they’re “wrong”. i’ve always always always had issues with people in my room and rearranging things, it drives me crazy to the point of rage, mostly due to everything being rearranged and my space being invaded. but another thing is that when people touch something of mine it’s “”wrong”” now, and i can’t explain why:/there’s a few more but i’m doing this off the top of my head. recently though there’s been a huge uptick in this behaviour (im not sure if OCD can be developed??) and i don’t know why. here’s the behaviour:- i have to constantly check my eyes by closing them and putting my fingers where my pupils are supposed to be to make sure they aren’t going lazy or i’m going blind, i also knock on wood 3 times occasionally or count to 3 in my head. i’m not sure why i do this, it feels like it’s to not ‘jinx’ it and to make sure i’ve done the thing properly if that makes sense?- speaking of knocking on wood i often do that to not ‘jinx’ myself, for example i think of cancer and i have to knock to ensure that i won’t get cancer. i know that knocking isn’t going to prevent that from happening but it feels right to do it, and it bothers me a little bit when i don’t. i have to knock 3 times or 3x3 times - sometimes i count to 3 in my head or 3x3 if i can’t knock on wood, this is a new thing - i have to lean on the fridge 3x3 times to ensure it’s PROPERLY closed and pull a silly face after- i often get really worried about electronics downstairs not being turned off, and windows/doors being left open and unlocked, as well as gas being left on(typing this is already freaking me out too:/). HOWEVER, this could just be anxiety as my brother often leaves the door open and unlocked even at night-same with the windows- and there was a time i accidentally left the gas on without noticing. i also have to count to three or pull a face after checking- i have to turn the tap on twice and make sure the water is ‘right’ (cold, not weird in consistency), i can’t drink it if it’s not because it freaks me out badly and idk why- raw chicken FREAKS ME OUT, i can’t shake the feeling that there’s germs everywhere all over my food and in the kitchen (could also just be anxiety bc my family tend to not wash their hands properly or wipe surfaces🙃🙃🙃). i often don’t eat at ALL when it’s been used in the kitchen bc my brain tells me i’ll throw up, i either have meltdowns over food that result in me hitting myself hard or i don’t eat at all. which is horrible. if i eat i end up feeling nauseas against my will and gagging- speaking of food sometimes i’m not allowed to eat because the food is “wrong”. sometimes it’s triggered by the thought of germs or something, sometimes it’s not. i can’t eat from the air fryer because it’s dirty and there’s fat that’ll get soaked into my food, i can’t eat rice because it’s all poison and it doesn’t matter if i cook it till it’s burnt because it’ll get me really sick. i can’t eat other foods because something is inexplicably ‘wrong’ with them.- not sure if this is OCD? it’s a bit tmi, i have a fear if i don’t pee before bed i’ll wet the bed. haven’t done that since i was at least seven but my brain for the last year has told me i need to wee before bed or i’ll piss myself 🙃 wonderful /si don’t know if this is OCD or just general anxiety, i didn’t have a great childhood and suffered from anxiety from age 14-16 but not like this. things have been stressful for the past year and although i’ve been doing these behaviours for a bit (to the point it didn’t really bother me) they’ve recently gotten so bad my bf says that “my OCD” is triggering his, which i feel terrible about. i’m wondering if anyone here can relate to any of these at all? ocd, anxiety, etc.;my boyfriend (diagnosed w ocd) thinks i may have developed it, but i’m not sure if that works and i’;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-16 22:46:13;2024-04-16;Tuesday;22:46:13;4563;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:51.918065

And hearing all of it killed me inside but also I gained so much respect for her for at least standing for what she believes is gonna help her. Now might I add I’ve always been very supportive of her and her feelings but it’s never been all that reciprocated none the less it’s been 3 days since she broke up with me I barely get a text off her maybe 1/3 hours today it was 6 hours and it will be a 3 text long sentence with no care in it at all. I’m struggling so much because even now she will say she loves me and cares for me but has straight up abandoned on our relationship. I’ve kept most of my feelings away from this incase is bothers her more apart from the simple “I’m really hurting and it hurts more because I just want to do right as a boyfriend but also as a human being by supporting you but you’re now treating me like a stranger” she didn’t have much to say. What makes it worse is I tried to at least get a reason for why she would want to be alone and she says “she doesn’t know” that’s all she’s said to me, she’s dragging me by strings and I feel like I’m about to explode, I’m extremely depressed since this is the happiest I’ve ever been and I wish I could just end it but I know I’ll just pass guilt onto my mom and into her life, the last text I got from her was “I’m sorry to hear you feel like that” to my message saying “I feel like I’ve lost my family you’ve been everything to me and you’ve got no remorse for how I feel” She said she wanted to be alone but has turned her location off and is now “staying at a friends house” it’s like she wants me in pain. And I really want it clear that me and her have been so good lately the day before she broke up with me we was looking at holidays abroad she said she was gonna propose to me on the next leap year how can you plan something like that and up and leave with “I don’t know” I’ve not slept in 4 days because I knew something was up I’ve not eaten without throwing it back up. And I’ve got nobody to talk to I’ve got no socials I’ve got her and now I don’t even have that she said she doesn’t know when I can call or when I can text or when I can see her. I’m done with it all. (Edit): I’ve also worked so hard on myself for her I pretty much changed everything I could to make us work I saw our lives together and I wanted to make it work.

1c5tbvm;Next Steps;Comfortable_Bid_5045;Hello, I made this account just to create this post and will probably delete after today.I come from a split family. Father was a drug addict and spent my life in prison. Step dad was an extremely abusive drunk. Mom cares a little for sure but I've questioned it from time to time unfortunately. I dated this girl for 7 years, we moved across the country about two years ago, where she suddenly left me and found a new guy. This put me through the usual mental battles, but I signed up for the Navy where I found out I was diagnosed with ADD and ODD as a child. On tip of this, I have an extremely hard time talking to other people, specifically adult males that are bigger then me. When it comes to my family I just lock up in anxiety and I can hardly speak to them, especially my parents. I've often wondered if this is trauma or if I am autistic. I have seen a therapist before, and it helped a little bit, but I have the exact same problem with them, I just lock up and it's impossible for me to speak or even hardly move in fear of ridicule. I am scared to death of going on a prescription for the rest of my life and ultimately I really can't afford a doctor or therapist.I currently have exactly 1 friend in this foreign to me state, and it's nice to have the social interaction but he's busy with his wife and personal stuff, and obviously I'm not going to trauma dump on him, were both middle 20 males.I am also extremely depressed, and from 18 until 23ish I abused substances very hard (lsd, coke, weed, and liquor mostly, but have cut down everything except weed.)Can anyone relate to my specific scenario and possibly give some insight on how to improve or if medication is all that bad? I just want to speak to my family. Also I've heard mixed opinions on this so I want to ask, is the constant metal music and Marijuana a positive or negative for me right now?

1c5t9ab;How to heal from toxic family?;usuguiria;"Hi! Im 18F and honestly im writing this as if im crying out for help. My family is extremely toxic, idk how to cope up with their wants and needs, i dont wanna hear their voice, it makes me mad. Even when my parents are showing me affection it makes me so mad that i push them away and scold them sometimes. I dont feel any emotional attachment to anyone even my parents. They aren't noticing that im slowly dieing inside. I don't have close friends and absolutely no social life at all. I don't go shopping (the last i went was 2 years ago) i just go to school and come back home. My younger sister is like a great friend but she has her own issues and i dont really find myself comfortable telling my problems to anyone. I grew up in a conservative family and even putting on makeup is a crime, getting dressed up is a crime. You're only a ""good child"" if you're someone who doesn't take interest in anything except your academics, someone who doesn't like ""fashion"". Both my maternal and paternal family put hate in my heart for each other (esp for my parents) my maternal grand parents and aunts/uncles would hate me and tell me all sorts of things because apparently im so ugly due to my father's facial features that i have inherited. The reason why both my parents and their families hated each other was because of class difference and my dad wanted a divorce but my mom didn't. My dad even denied that i was his child (im his biological child and he knows it), my mom hated me because i was somewhat attached to my dad before all this started. When i was 6/7 years old my dad would hit me with a belt and make me sleep on the floor of i got less grades, my mom would say that I dont have intelligence or beauty. My grandma would scold me if i ate alot and if i ate something that was ""expensive"". One of my male cousin who is my age sexually abused me and used to try to sneak in and take pictures of me when i was showering or changing. He even insulted me in school when i did nothing bad to him except that i used to write notes for him, complete his projects, clean his room and help him in studying, i thought he was my best friend. I dont know what i have done to be going through all of this. Im failing everywhere, im addicted to my phone, i have high myopia, my academics are so bad, im losing weight, i dont have any talents nor am i in any form of sport. My friends have so many achievements but im nothing compared to them. Please give me suggestions on what to do. I also wanna get therapy.. but in the country that i live in, depression and mental illness are non existent. You're mentally ill only if you're a retard.

1c5swwm;Living in Big Brother ;effs19;Hey!This is gonna be my very first time trying to explain this to anyone so please be easy on me. I'm doing this mostly because I need to know if anyone else has feel this way? Since I can remember I feel like I am constantly being watched by a group of people, something similar to big brother (that's how I started called so), like wherever I go, live or just pass by and whatever I do and say they are always following me and watching me. Sometimes I even can hear the conversations they have about me and my decisions and how they judge me. And this has made me to act in consequently to that, since it started to happen I have become less and less talkative, more introvert, i feel embarrassed all the time and I just can't do anything anymore without feeling judge by those people. The other thing is that depending on the day, or how i feel the people change, sometimes is a group compound by members of my family, sometimes by some of the bullies from my highschool, sometimes even by famous people that i like. Since it has been happening for so long I have create some cameraless (that's how I like to call them) spaces, which are basically safes spaces where they are not there, which are usually the toilets or bathrooms. I even only get change there for example. I have been in therapy but honestly I was completely terrified of saying this to any of my past psychologies since I was afraid to end up internal in a psychiatrist or something similar. But I just can't live my life this way anymore, it's so sofocating and hard dealing with them every fucking second of the day.

1c5sp2w;My Life is a Recurring Escapism Cycle;aboslutelyclueless;I’ve been struggling with this for so long and I’m at a loss for what to do. Every day, I wake up exhausted and drag myself to school/ work. I feel mostly fine, even cheerful while I’m there. Then, the moment I get home, it’s all over. I feel this intense, deep feeling of misery that I just cannot rationalize no matter how hard I try. I don’t have an inner monologue and have total aphantasia , so if I don’t occupy myself with something, I will just wallow in my despair in silence with no way to explain it. I scroll through reels, play games, read fiction manhwa, anything to try and drown it out. This doesn’t bring me any actual joy, just empty momentary distraction. If anything, reading fiction makes me invest into the characters too much emotionally, and feel even worse afterwards because my life feels even more sad, dull and lonely in comparison. Nothing really brings me joy. I tried out different hobbies, but they are so unfulfilling and unentertaining that I start putting on music or podcasts in the background of whatever I’m doing to try and keep myself engaged, and eventually give up. I think my aphantasia contributes for this problem, since it’s extremely difficult for me to be imaginative. It’s like I cannot bear being in the present, and am trying to mentally escape anywhere else through any method possible subconsciously. Everything feels incredibly sad, lonely and dull. My life isn’t even objectively bad, quite the opposite. I go to school. I have friends. I do sports. I’m mostly fine financially. Can’t afford therapy at the moment through lmao.

1c5so6g;Attention issues (not like you think);Jin-Yunzi;"Hi, I post this to seek answers to something that's been troubling me for a while now    I don't know if it's the right sub reddit to explain all of this or it's the right flair eitheir so if I should move it somewhere else, please let me know, I wish to not bother anyone, even less by a mistake such as this    English is not my mother language so please, no hate about any mistakes I'd make, just notify it so I can improve with time.    So my problem is complicated to explain and I never saw anyone talking about it on socials or anything near it - I have not done many researches eitheir    I will image it ; there is me, I'll go by ""Yin"" on reddit, and there is ""Saika"". Both of theses names are obviously invented, they just sounded good to me.    I'll give a few infos so it's clearer. ""Saika"" is sort of a character I made 7 years ago when I really started to play video game as a hobby (gaming is my passion). I didn't felt like sharing infos such as my name, age, or anything like this on socials and games so I made up an obviously fake indentity, and naturally, the few virtual friends I have calls me with that name. Saika has a whole story and identity, I won't share it because I believe it's not necessary. All you have to know is that Saika is a bad and toxic person.    I will now talk about my problem itself : I feel like everything I do is in the aim of getting attention. To image it : Yin is Saika's puppet. Saika likes attention of course as everyone does but she didn't felt like suffering through the consequences and second hand embarassment so she created Yin to take it all instead of her.    I feel like I've been designed or created by Saika with everything to get attention - by attention, I mean love, care, but also hatred or disgust. Whatever it is. - Everything is made for that.    To give an example, I'll talk about school. As a lot of teens, school is hell for me. I am that one hated kid in the class who get all the rumors on their back. Not that especially mind the rumors, most of the teens in my school are clones, they all behave the same, likes the same things, same meaningless dramas.. Maybe I am the anomaly there but it feels like they have no personality - at least, they don't display it, maybe to fit with others? Regardless, with rumors comes bad gazes (not sure of how I'm supposed to call it but basically a permanent side eye), and theses makes me feel very uneasy. I am very insecure about my body, I always come to class wearing a sweat regardless of the weather, and my bottom is a bit tight but i'm covered waist to mid-tighs with the sweat (I have severals copies of the same clothe). I also always have a headset for music wich is always turned on and I always listen to something except in class, obviously, and when a friend talks to me. It helps me not panicking too much when I hear them laugh or when I feel their gazes upon me. My grades are miserable as well, like literally. The link with the attention is that everything is my own fault. I, myself, decided to not work even if I could. I, myself, decided to be rude - uncounsciously, I regret it right after all the time- to classmates. I decided to be that weird girl. Even tho it hurts me so much to go to school, because of this. Perhaps it is a need to feel different when I see all them being clones but I feel like from a fair viewpoint, you'd rather be a clone for everyone, and your friends would know who you really are?    /TW : slight mention of self harm & suic!de    To get back at the attention stuff, I feel designed for attention because things that could put my life in danger is not an option, blade ""phobia"", can't suic!de nor self harm. And well- Saika prob doesn't want her puppet to fall appart, a dead can't get attention. To keep it imaged : how can a puppet move if it cuts the strings linked to the master? (To be clear : I am not suicidal. I already thought of it some times, but never planned on doing not have I ever tried. Same goes for self harm, except I wanted to try and I still kinda do, but this blade ""phobia"" makes me unable to.)    I'm pretty sure a lot of people are going to believe that I do that for attention and post this for attention. And to be honest, I don't know myself. If I am designed for attention, then it's a possibility.    I would understand any reactions like this, but if anyone thinks of this differently and want to ask anything, I'll gladly answer. I have others examples and of course this is not the only problem in my life so maybe it could help understand. I posted this to seek for potential answers somewhere I know I can't be recognized, and with a lot of people who have differents mindset and way to think - so perhaps will it help me figure something out.    I'll answer any question and develop anything as long as it doesn't make me feel uncomfortable, I really want answers or theories of why tf am I like this, hoping the answser isn't just because I am.";Hi, I post this to seek answers to something that's been troubling me for a while now    I don't kno;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-16 21:59:59;2024-04-16;Tuesday;21:59:59;4956;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:24.833920

1c5s07r;trying to understand myself by typing it down;NyanBon;"i've been feeling down these past 3 weeks, no special reason why it'd be this bad but i know 2 things that could be doing it  i don't know where i'm going with my life, im an autistic 17 year old who skipped a lot of school due to bullying which wasn't even that bad but due to my sensitivity i skipped out probably all of 9th year. which fucked up all of my grades and i wish i never skipped school cause i wanted to experience my teenage school years. now i go to a individual study plan which means i'm just fixing my grades, which for me isn't easy because i should known all the things from 9th year but i dont. i dont wanna go to school anymore because it's deteriorating my mental health, but how will i get a job that i actually enjoy doing if i dont study for it? i just wanna drop out and start workinganother reason is my relationshipi'm young so i don't have a lot of experience with relationships except for the ones i've had online, i don't think they count though because of their shortness. last year in September or somewhere around there, i started talking to this boy who i've always known but never really spoke to, we only started seeing each others regularly due to new school plans putting us in the same lesson. we didn't start talking before i initiated it, asking for his socials cause i thought we could get along. we started playing games together, i started coming over to his place a lot, watching him play games. i initiated much more stuff than him 21 December, the time came to ask him the big question of getting together. i'd already fallen for him and i hoped he said yes, i regret the way i did it though cus i'd much rather do it in person if i could go back in time. this boy got me smitten as a kitten, i've never had someone like me like this irl, i never had boys notice me and this one did, but i feel like its only because i first talked to him. i wonder where we'd be if i never asked him for his discord lol.  the problem comes in these 3 weeks, i've been constantly feeling down, not feeling enough, feeling drained, feelings like my life is pointless if i don't do something with it, so suicidal thoughts aswell. i love my boyfriend so much and i dont wanna lose him. i feel im annoying, him having to constantly comfort me when i'm crying, and reassuring me when im talking down on myself almost everyday. i talk down on me as a joke to cope but i know he knows what i actually mean. i analyze a lot of peoples behavior, and i know when someone changed. i dont think it's that bad and i'm just overthinking but this overwhelming feeling of i'm getting annoying to be around, that i'm boring and he'd prefer someone else has been taking over me. he still says he loves me all the time multiple times a day, hugs and kisses me. everything he's been doing since the beginning. it's only been about 4 months since we've gotten together. i know you can't always give constant affection your whole relationship, but i definitely wouldanother thing that started happening now is that when i'm at his place, he promises me he'll watch a movie with me or cuddle, basically alone time. he'll just first play with his friends, it'll go 30 mins, 1 hour, 2 hours, eventually i fall asleep waiting for him. i get woken up by him kissing me and telling me he's done playing. i get up and i'm ready to watch the movie, he lays down, starts the film and immediately sleeps. i'm ended up to watchin it alone but i turn it off later because i didn't wanna watch the movie, i wanted to watch it with him. he could stay up for 24 hours with his friend but he can't with me. i don't have a chance against his friends. he prefers them over me, ""bros before hoes"". he doesn't say that but i know he'd choose them over me. because friends are a lot more meaningful than your lover. i'd place a scenario of him having a gun, his close friend and me standing infront of him, guess who he would shoot? he used to spend more time with me alone, but now he's been drifting from that.   i'm done writing this. i just wanna formulate my thoughts so i can read it instead of it being scrambled in my mind";i've been feeling down these past 3 weeks, no special reason why it'd be this bad but i know 2 thing;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-16 21:32:50;2024-04-16;Tuesday;21:32:50;4120;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-20 21:06:24.775611

1c5rzkh;Positive outpatient experiences w finding right meds?;Glittering-Lion2340;Hellooo idk if anyone cares butttt I got on a waitlist for outpatient- may move up to higher level if I need to. I’ll start first or second week of May. I’m really hoping they will finally get me on the right medication I’m just so sick of constantly trying things it j keep messing w my head mentally exhausting stressed about it everyday and physically my body is just run downnnn. Anyone have positive experiences in them finding the right meds through outpatient/inpatient any type of treatment center? My np was also supposed to do a referral to the center for me Friday and she never did it. I left a message to her office (since they didn’t pick up) yesterday morning to ask if she sent it in/if she could do it and I still haven’t gotten a call back. So I did it all today myself and asked the center if they got a referral from her they said no. Do I call her office again and tell her they need her records? Cus they do to get me on right treatment. I feel annoying calling again but this should be taken seriously on her part I’m worried she dropped me as a patient or something it’s really weird. She also started me on a new med and I asked when should our follow up appointment be and she said she will do the referral, they will call me back and set up a time for me to start, and then when that’s completed I will call her to let her know that the center and I set something up and her and I will then set up an appointment to meet. If that made any sense. But she’s literally not answering and now I have to call to get my records in, and to try to set up an appointment with her. Can I be dropped without knowing? Ugh I’m so stressed out over this right now and stressed over my meds because I just want to feel better and want to start something that will help me and I don’t think abilify will benefit all my issues in the long run.

1c5ry7t;Social Anxiety Disorder;ET_90210;I have had social anxiety since grade school. I didn't know what it was until today reading about it and finding other people with identical feelings. Always been afraid to talk to people, afraid to try anything for fear of looking stupid. Never did sports or participate in anything fun as a kid. I never want to confront someone if i am done wrong. No social media I go out of my way to not interact with someone if i see them in public. i could never randomly start or hold a conversation. Being like this led me to quitting school becuse the social part of school is too much. I can remember never saying a word in grades k-3. It has caused me to be alone depressed and no ambition. I have zero friends and its impossible to have a romantic intrest being this way. I hate the word shy because that how ppl have described me since i was little. I am 55 years old and because of it I have been depressed my whole life and have always been alone. I have completely cutoff everyone including family. Quit my job and have not left my home since sept or october. No idea what to do. I have never received any type of couciling or help. I never thought it would help because I have a problem talking and there are things i wouldnt tell because i feel i would be judged ot laughed at, so i felt it would go nowhere. Quitting my work also stoppedd my insurance so treatment isnt really an option financially. I wish I knew 40 years ago this was a condition and i wasn't just weird and shy, my life would of been very different.

1c5rixc;I've some tips for exercising ;jellyfish-cafe;Exercise makes a big difference when it comes to mental health. Some people have had their symptoms eliminated. Others have them reduced. So far, I'm the latter. I've trauma, anxiety, ocd and am prone to depression. So far, exercise has made the negative thoughts go from like the experience of someone yelling in your face to the experience of someone yelling in another room. I still have my issues, but they're more manageable and it's definitely worth it. My advice: Pick an activity you enjoy. You don't have to go to the gym. Hiking, bicycling, walking, dancing, water activities like rowing or surfing, on and on. You can just put on YouTube and exercise. I like the YouTube channel The Fitness Marshall. He has one song dances and longer dances. They have every exercise you can imagine on YouTube. Ballet, belly dancing, yoga, pilates, boxing, you name it. Apps can also make it fun. There is a running app called Zombies, Run that gives you an audio story where you're in the zombie apocalypse and zombies chase you. There are fun runs like the bubble run, mud rud and color run that can make training more exciting. Don't make your goals aesthetic. Physical improvement is just an extra and unnecessary. Focus on your immediate benefits like stress reduction, better focus, less anxiety, etc.  Don't push yourself too hard. You don't want to dread doing it. Also, a beginner could injure themselves. Start small and build a habit. Identify as an active person. If you tell yourself you dislike exercise you won't do it. If you tell yourself you're lazy or can't stick to exercise you will create that reality. How you view activity and especially your own identity is extremely important to changing habits. Give yourself regular small rewards. Whatever you want. Just to show appreciation for your hard work and have something to look forward to. I gently encourage you to not focus on weight loss. I've been bulimic so I know how easily it can become an obsession. But even not being bulimic it just makes things a lot less fun. Also, your weight fluctuates daily due to things like water intake, food, hormones. If you desire weight loss that's fine. But if you're active and aren't out eating the calories you burn it will come off regardless. Exercise shouldn't be a punishment and it's easy to get caught up in that when you focus on weight. That's all. I hope you find this helpful!;Exercise makes a big difference when it comes to mental health.

Any advice/ suggestions welcomed, Thank you all.For as long as i can remember ive had very little emotional connection to anything (minus seeing other things suffer), i have no motivation or love for my life and being alive is only something i keep at because it would be more effort to get out of it then its worth- i could never explain what’s my reason for wanting out of life as i have really anything i could want.

They think they just have to keep raising it cause I'm getting worse, and I have a childrens psychiatrist.And he says that he don't know about much about children's psychiatric issues, And he didn't even help me at all and he also said that he only has 1 appointment with people not more than one.And I'm also scared cause my church (my parents are Christians) and they don't mind me being a lesbian, my church is really rude when you don't 1 THING they don't think is right you can get in SO much trouble.Like my older brother for example: His current girlfriend at the time. (this was about 2 years ago)She wasn't really religious and he wasn't extremely at the point either, and two of the rude middle aged guys. (The preacher and one of the elders)They we're yelling and scolding at him to break up with her in his room, and they also came to our house unattended without asking.And he was SOBBING, my older brother never cries.And he has never gone back to the church since.And whenever I go to a youth group there, the girl leader is always dress coding me and she's not fun, but the other 2 guy leaders are really fun to br around, but that girl I swear she doesn't like me at all.And there was once a time were I was given a drive back home. (And the people driving me back was one of the people that harassed my older brother and his wife, this was a few months ago)I was saying how I LOVED watching horror movies and they calmed me down and distracted me cause of how violent they can be.And they were saying how I shouldnt watch those cause of how bad they are, they've always never treated us nicely.And I'm scared they will find out I'm a lesbian.Specific people there make me wanna end my life.They've made me. (Not physically) wanna try and my life again, and I've relapsed so many times cause of them.And I'm also scared I might not be diagnosed with something cause I want to be able to tell people what's wrong with me and feel valid about it. (I'm getting assessed for autism) And so then my doctors know how to fking treat me for once.And my therapist doesn't like labels, and she's not willing to give me validation for touchy subjects and it makes me feel awful.And I can't make friends, I can't stop cting myself. (I've been doing it since the end of November 2022)And my older sister who has BPD, we are always getting into arguments, she's always saying really hurtful things to me.Like ""jump out the window for all I care"", ""DO I look like I care?"", ""no come down now or I'll make it for you!"".She's getting over an eating disorder aswell and she's gets hangry so easily, and never leaves me alone, and she gets hangry to the point of yelling at my parents and my 2 other older siblings. (I'm the youngest at 15)And we used to be really close, now she doesn't like it when I have alone time and she's always think I'm going to kll mself or ct mself everytime I'm alone.I'm extremely close with my dad, I tell him when I get my times of the months, when I need to vent, and he always calms me down cause we have alot of similar interests and I get alot of my traits from my dad.I'm close to my family and my brothers new GF, it's just, hard to cope when money is tight and all these issues are happening.And my older sister is always yelling at me most of the time and it's getting really draining.I'm getting ro a point where I think it's better off if I end my life.";Trigger warning Scide and adction and self hrm and religious subjects.(Touchy subjects)I've been hav;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-16 20:55:32;2024-04-16;Tuesday;20:55:32;4648;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:50.735268

1c5qxms;Heavy suicidal for a year now and want help;Nie_-;It all started when I was 15. I dont know where it came from but suddenly (literally in 1 day) I felt really depressed and i thought people were ignoring me,… I just suddenly shut down and isolated myself from all of my friends from school. I had alot of friends and I was loved by everyone but suddenly 1 day it switched. Then I got deeper and deeper into depression and i couldnt seem to get out of it, it just kept getting worse and worse. In that time I still skated everyday and sailed every weekend. I also came head to head with suicide twice with my suicide note in hand, but then i fell down and cried and didnt do it. I couldnt tell anyone, i was ashamed and affraid. This really heavy depressive episode where i just felt trapped in my emotions lasted for about 5 months with ups and downs. It is just weird i was happy the other moment and really sad the other moment. Most of the time I was depressed. After summer break I picked up all my courage and to go to my friends and just stand and talk with them again. They all accepted me back, they said they thought i was ignoring them. I told them nothing about that i was depressed. The following 3 months everything was back to normal until i got the same feeling as last time and got depressed but this time it is alot harder. Last week i came back and faced with suicide and a note in my hand the same thing happened and i just broke down. Suddenly i dont feel like skateboarding anymore which is my passion. I used to skate everyday and even sometimes wake up at 5am to skate before school because i had dreams of being sponsored by my skateshop. I was finally getting good and i was in my prime but now i dont feel like it but i still want to i just cant to lift my body to do anything. Recently my sailing partner stopped and i also dont sail anymore. Wich was my second passion, we were doing europian championship, national championship,… Now its all gone. I used to play oboe everyday now i cant get my body to do it. Im affraid im going to kill myself. I want to talk to people about my problems but i just cant. I think everyone hates me, i hate the anxiety. I hate that everyone thinks that im ignoring them. I hate that i list all my passions. And i hate it that i can be happy but suddenly i am depressed. This depression is literally going to kill me. And o want help but i cant because im affraid of emotional connections. Please help i actually cant take it anymore and i will eventually kill myself if i dont get out of here.;It all started when I was 15.

1c5q7bn;My father-in-law hit on my mom on Valentine's Day;No_Nobody_9586;"Posting this from a throw away account for obvious reasons. Not even 4 months after my dad passed away, my father-in-law showed up alone on V-day at our house, with chocolates and rose. He's a doctor, so sometimes he used to check mom and dad's blood pressure and stuff, he carries the stethoscope and the BP measuring device with him. So that day when he showed up, he offered to check mom's BP, and holding her hand he said, ""you hand is so soft"". Mom was taken aback, and took her hand back. She did not tell me about this for a long time, but decided to tell me about it on phone (because I live in a different country) one day when I kept asking her to seek father-in-law's help on some matter. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. I did not know how to react. And of course, mom made me promise to never speak of this to anyone, least of all to my wife, as that has a very high chance of leading to fights between the two families if my wife does not believe it happened.So, here I am, having to live with this disgusting truth, cursed to take it to my grave. I don't know what the fuck was father-in-law thinking would happen! Like... WHAT THE FUCKKK!!!! I am doomed to pretend smile at them when they visit our home now, or when we visit theirs, for the sake of keeping my family intact. But I am not that kind of a person, I have never had to hide anything from anyone before in my life. That's why I'm just tired of living like this, specially now that I am back home, because of the birth of my first child, so I have to visit my wife's parents' place several times, and see and talk with him, pretending I do not know what he did. Ugh, what a shit show. Sometimes I feel mom should have just spoken up immediately and told about it to everyone - to me, my wife and even to mom-in-law - whatever happened, we should have just let it happen. If my wife would have left me because of that, so be it. Because the alternative is just fucking suffocating to live with.";Posting this from a throw away account for obvious reasons.

1c5q6fh;Can't think straight/disoriented ;aaron_la21;Hi everyone sorry if this isn't the correct sub Reddit but I wasn't sure which one would be good to talk about this. I'm a 17y boy, and ever since I was a child I've had no mental problems up to recently in the last 3 months. I can't even remember how it happened it sorted of just slowly came in. I started getting symptoms of brain fog like really bad, I couldnt think straight like all the time, so I thought I'm probably going down with something so I'll leave it to see but it stayed in my head. It's really hard to explain what im feeling but I'll give my symptoms. For example sometimes I be sitting doing work and suddenly everything around me goes all weird and I can't think straight, I always find myself rubbing my eyes and my eyesight is all weird BUT the thing is it comes and goes. It's really bad in the morning when I wake up as nothing feels real, Im still able to function but my head just ain't there like I just can't think straight but it feels really weird almost like the world is pulsating around me. Again, it's hard for me to explain. It's at its worst when I do sports as I get tired at points and it's almost like my head can't recognise danger or anyone around me. A lot of the times after I stand up I feel myself swaying a lot like my head is spinning and I can't balance. Another big impact it's having is on my driving lessons. I have been learning way before this happened and it's coming up to my test but ever since this thing started happening I just haven't been doing great, even my instructor notices. When I'm driving I seem to just drift off like I can't focus but I can't control it. Sometimes I generally don't feel safe driving like I could easily crash if I really don't try to focus which is hard. Mentally for me it's having a big impact as I think I'm going insane because NOBODY believes me. I've told my parents but they just dismiss it and say I'm not sleeping enough or I'm working too much and do less days, I kept asking them to ring the doctor but they said the doctor wouldn't see me because the symptoms sound stupid and they will only look at me if it's physic problem so idk. Nobody believes me and it's not going away. I'm perfectly healthy, I do sports 3 time a week, I eat healthy, I sleep enough and I'm not the type to get stressed easily so I'm stuck like really stuck.If you've got this far, thanks for reading I'll answer anymore questions you need. Symptoms:-Feeling disoriented -cant think straight (comes and goes)-vision blurs at certain times-lack of awareness of my surroundings -lack of focusness-sway often when I stand up-light headed all the time-object, buildings, people, myself don't feel real multiple times a day-constantly zoned out(very hard to control at times);Hi everyone sorry if this isn't the correct sub Reddit but I wasn't sure which one would be good to ;Question;2;1;2024-04-16 20:18:35;2024-04-16;Tuesday;20:18:35;2748;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 09:09:40.891307

1c5q4bx;My gf took Clifton Strengths test and coaching session - now she seems to be keen on following her advice - I'm afraid it will make her avoid looking for actual help.;Bronek999;"First of all, this is a kind of throwaway account, I don't want to take any risks.For a little background, I'm dating a girl for over half a year now and we wanted to take next step and move in together. As title states, my gf took the Clifton Strengths test. From what I can gather, this is not something that is actually science-based, but perhaps I'm misinformed. The test did highlight her problem with getting motivated to perform tasks. She often only starts working right before deadline, classic procrastination. She is in process of getting diagnosed whether this could be depression, ADHD, or something else. She delays going to therapist, even though she says she has unresolved issues.So what happened on the coaching session is that supposedly they match coaches and coachees with similar scores and the lady told her she never talked with anyone with score so close to her. They had a good talk and came to the conclusion that what would help her achieving tasks is... more deadlines for any kind of task. Now, I've seen how stressed she is with deadlines and what it does to our relationship so I got skeptical about how it is supposed to work and she got unhappy because she was excited about this session and I criticized it.Maybe this is selfish, but I have a hard time understanding how setting up more deadlines would allow her to work on her underlying anxiety. I'm afraid she will not look for actual help in working on her issues and instead will make deadlines to be ""productive"" but not actually working on her mental health. Again, maybe I should just be supportive of her choice, but I'm so worried it will lead to more problems down the line. Maybe there was something missing in the communication. Maybe I'm not flexible enough. I'm all for personal growth if you actually learn valuable skills or something real about your emotions and where they come from. This sounds like a dangerous gimmick to me.

1c5putc;I want to live not just survive ;cookie_jar99;This is going to be a long one. Anyone who knows me, knows I talk A LOT but it’s my way of vettj g things off my chest. I feel I need a lot of validation so I like to over explain. I apologise!I hate to play the victim card, but I have been subject of domestic abuse in two relationships. I don’t know how I’m so dumb or how I allowed those types of people into my life, but I did. One man I was with for 4/5 years, I thought he was my everything. He beat me, cheated on me and emotionally abused me. He was a bully. Told me how dumb and naive I was. I now know he was gaslighting me. He would tell me how much my family disliked me, how they’d tell him these things and discuss how to take my children from me. He would threaten me with my life, or my children, if I tried to leave. He’s threaded me with knives, spat on me, strangled me, suffocated me, headed me and beaten me multiple times. He’s given me nosebleeds, broken my phones, kicked me out of my house with our newborn baby and no nappies. Basically, he’s evil. I met the next guy I dated during my abusive relationship so of course he prayed on my vulnerability and used and abused me too. This man is argue was worse. He was 33, I was 20. I know it may not seem a big deal to some but in hindsight, he was preying on me. I was 19 when he first told me he was interested. This man raped me, told me if I didn’t sleep with him he’d share my nudes and sexual content, he moved himself into my home without consent. He strangled me, threw me on my bed and made the bed break. He took my money from me and made my life hell. If I’d throw him out my house it had to be with force but he’d always steal things first so I had to allow him in again. Things like baby formula or my phone charger. He used to force me to take overdoses, convincing me it was the right thing to do because no one wanted me here and the world would be better without me. Then he’d tell me I couldn’t break up with him because I’d lose my kids. I have got a restraining order against him now. These men RUINED my life. I do not know how to fix myself. My ex keeps making me relapse. Last year it was when the PTSD began which made me a version of myself I didn’t know. It ruined my relationship with a really good guy. Now he keeps breaching the restraining order and I want it to end. I wish the people around me understood what I go through. The nightmares I have every night. The way I jump if the door goes. If I see people walk past my fence in the garden. If I see an unknown number calling. I relapsed again on Saturday. I’m so poorly.

1c5pr8u;I’m scared of moving my leg after dislocating my kneecap although it’s recovering well.;Fluffy_Funny_5278;Don’t know if this is the right place for this but I feel this has more to do with anxiety than my leg actually hurting.So a few days ago, I (17) dislocated my kneecap “out of nowhere”, probably fromcarrying some heavy stuff just a minute prior to the incident. Now, I’m still recovering but don’t think it’s normal to be absolutely terrified of moving my leg at all (or even just taking off the thing that keeps my leg from moving, which the doctor said I’m allowed to do for washing myself). I take off the bandage thing and I just tense up, even if I have no intention of moving my leg. I just feel such dread from my leg being unprotected, like it would snap right out of place if I don’t physically hold it 24/7. I also feel this is weird because nothing really serious happened (no ligaments torn, it didn’t hurt a lot and I was able to move my knee just fine right after it was put back together) and I have been through worse pain that wasn’t this anxiety inducing (although I do have a general fear of falling and getting hurt, that has been an ongoing issue for the past few years). Of course I have no intention of running a marathon right after this but I just don’t think it’s normal to feel such anxiety about my leg. I also don’t know how to stop feeling so anxious which is why I’m writing this post in the first place.;Don’t know if this is the right place for this but I feel this has more to do with anxiety than my l;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-16 20:01:46;2024-04-16;Tuesday;20:01:46;1335;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:51.985569

1c5phue;36f, recently diagnosed with PTSD & Depression, seeking support 💗 and like minded individuals;Seeking_higher_self;Hi everyone 👋🏻 new here. I had a beautiful daughter 2 1/2 years ago but her birth was traumatic and resulted in injury. I have been in a lot of therapy since then and I am dealing with that traumatic experience and other past traumas. A lot of my issues come from an abusive relationship in my late teens into early 20’s. Through this I am developing a real sense of self worth, which I’ve never had before. I felt pretty worthless and burdensome prior to working with this particular therapist. I have had the same friends since school, and I have been putting boundaries in place since I had my daughter when I’ve felt hurt by their actions. There have been a number of instances with different friends where I have communicated my feelings due to their actions, with hope to discuss the issues and improve relationships - but I’ve been met with animosity and blame and I seem to be losing people all over the show. I’m finding it pretty lonely, but I am understanding who I am and what my values are which is really important to me. I can’t tell if it is my CPTSD pushing people away or whether what I am going through is normal and I should continue on this journey of alignment to my true self? I feel so misunderstood and that no one will ever understand me. I have a wonderful husband and our emotional connection has grown through this journey, but my friends have always been very important to me and I’m struggling with those losses. Has anyone been through anything similar?? If anyone would like to share that they’re experiencing or have experienced a similar journey i would find comfort hearing about it. Thanks xx;Hi everyone 👋🏻 new here.

1c5pgd5;What can help a panic attack aside from xanax?;Successful_Garden278;"I've (30y F) started having pretty severe panic attacks in the last year. They've gotten worse since November, to the point where I've called an ambulance twice and went to the emergency room a third time on my own. No doctor will prescribe a benzodiazepine due to the addiction risk, but I'd really like them for mid-attack. I have propranolol, works great for before I feel an attack coming on, but once I'm in one, it doesn't seem to help. I also have been on a steady dose of zoloft, up to 150 mg now to try to help with these attacks. The doc wants me to go to 200 mg of zoloft instead of trying any ""as needed"" meds for during the attacks. I don't have any history of drug or alcohol abuse. I'm really just desperate for something to get me through these attacks that doesn't involve calling an ambulance!!  Edit: I'm not even sure how to describe how I feel during the attacks, but it's extreme nausea, diarrhea, I'm usually shaking on the floor, terrified I'm going to die and just begging for it to stop. The doctor recently told me I won't actually vomit or have diarrhea , that's the anxiety talking..... but both of those things do occur during these really bad attacks, so idk why he said that.";I've (30y F) started having pretty severe panic attacks in the last year.

1c5p3vm;My wife(30f) is unhappy, hates almost everything and I (32M) don't know what to do;Blin_Clinton;I met my wife during the pandemic, she lived two hours away in Canada. I liked that she seemed very chill, and despite the border closure we met up at a park on the border where it was allowed to hang out. We did this for a year and a half, and because she put up with that adversity I thought we could do anything. When it came to just hanging out, cuddling, enjoying weed together, making each other laugh i thought we were compatible. When she is in a good mood she can be funny, nice, playful, and generous.We got married two years ago and it's been challenging.I'm Hispanic and fairly extroverted. I like get togethers with friends, participating in orgs, going out at night, but also appreciate my alone time. While the border was closed I couldn't wait to include her in my activities, and she humored my ideas. I've come to realize that she had very little interest in these things. She comes from a Chinese background, has really severe adhd, depression and an avoidant personality. It is really hard to convince her to come out to things. She doesn't enjoy talking to people. For her, sitting around listening to conversations people are having that don't particularly pertain to her, is torture. She doesn't like loud venues, and I struggle to get her to leave the house because she sees most errands as a waste of time. She doesn't enjoy exercise and despite hating cloudy cold weather, it's like pulling teeth to get her on a walk when it's nice out.  What does she do for fun? Not alot. She is intensely critical of food, shows, films. She really only puts them on for background noise.She smokes a lot of weed, orders takeout and bubble tea compulsively, and spends most of her time shopping on Amazon for organizers or playing candy crush. She complains she can't do anything fun because she has no money, but when I ask her what she would do if she did, she has no answer. She is mostly ok with me doing my own thing but sometimes she thinks we don't spend anytime together. When I do try to spend time with her, she is glued to her phone or doing projects around the house, can't get her to sit down and spend quality time together. She only eats about one meal a day, and nutrition is not something she cares about.  If the food isn't something she craves, she prefers to just not eat at all. She told me that as a kid she had to go to the doctor because she would only eat chicken and rice and got violently constipated. She hates her own cooking even though I love her food when she does cook. She doesn't like anything I make. She has no friends and the ones she did have were also very traumatized asian girls with coping and substance issues. I have tried to include her in My friend circle but she has criticisms of almost everyone, that they are too boring or dorky or awkward (even though theyre perfectly fine people and she generally makes a good impression on them, they always ask me about her and I have to make excuses because she won't come out)She has pretty much disowned her own family, her dad left her a message asking her to at least check in and confirm that she's alive, she hasn't called or responded to him in weeks and doesn't plan to. I have a lot of empathy for the fact that alot of this is mental health struggles and trauma, and her mom passing away during the pandemic.  But she is miserable and her coping is not productive. I have no problem with weed in and of itself, it's been life-changing in a good way for me personally, but she is using it as a crutch. When we dated she took harder drugs and only stopped because I told her I would break up with her if she kept doing it.  I convinced her to see a psychiatrist and counseling, anti depressants have helped because she doesn't ideate suicide anymore, but counseling has been harder, she stopped going for several months and only just got back.She was miserable living at home, she was miserable living with me at our old apartment, and now that we own a house, she hates the house and she hates that she spent 100k of her own money on renovations (that i advised her not to do or to delay for a year) that didn't go the way she wanted. She constantly complains that she's poor and hates her job and hates her life and has nothing to show for any of it. But she blows most of her paycheck on takeout, organizers, 3 trips a week to the weed store and bubble tea. I tell her to budget and be reasonable, and she says she can't cope without that stuff. I realize that she is never going to like doing alot of the things I like to do and that we aren't super compatible, but I married her. I would be ok with  her being a closed off home body if she was at least happy and healthy, but lately I can only stand so much of someone telling me that our life together isn't good enough and that they wish they had stayed in Canada. Her saying this last part in particular caused me to break down and cry,and she seemed shocked that her saying all this hurt my feelings. I can only take so much and wonder why she is even still here. In one argument a while back , she considered separating and leave me with the house, but that she wanted me to pay her back the 100k that she spent on HER botched reno. I don't have that kind of money. Ever since I cried the other night we have been avoiding each other. She apologized for taking her frustrations out on me, but her overall view is that she sacrificed alot and only got my love in return. Her words. Worrying about her happiness and trying to have a good life with her has made what should be a happy life very stressful and tiring for me. I feel like if she was different, or if she has some kind of breakthrough, we could be happy. Tl:dr I don't know if my marriage is worth fighting for or if I should just prepare myself for the inevitable separation/divorce. She has mental health issues and I've bent over backward to be accommodating and accepting of her where she is, but it's not enough and she isn't happy.;I met my wife during the pandemic, she lived two hours away in Canada.

Every time I have to do anything these days makes my mind and body scream with frustration that I am still pushing forward and I still don't know why, or if it leads anywhere. I feel trapped in a loop of menial daily garbage, but I see no realistic alternatives. My brain always wanders to just blowing all my money on a last ditch effort: Gamble all my money to win big and if that doesn't work I'll just earn my freedom by blowing my head off. The ONE thing holding me back is my family and friends. I don't want to hurt them, so I stay despite my desire to leave. I wish I could get help, but even my health care providers (who I pay to help me, but don't for some fucking reason) haven't helped. I've had them randomly cancel my appointments even though I confirmed the dates and all I wanted was a consultation for a therapist, but no. I'm not worth their time and effort.

I sent a SOS to my SO on Saturday evening telling I was depressed, they don't seem to really care as they still don't know where I am (didn't ask for, although I would have answered. I just said I went away from town), what I did or even if I m alive. I stopped answering on Sunday and no one is wondering if I am safe. My SO just offered to go out for dinner later this week, not even wondering why I don't answer my phone.

1c5nzjv;Should I take a longer sick leave for my mental health ?;midnightspot;Hello everybody! Thank you for taking your time to read this I‘m really in need for some advice..Last year I started a new job working with kids. It is a fixed contract so I am working there a little less than a year. After about 2 months I realized that this is not what I‘m looking for since it‘s a position with high responsibility and leadership, whereas neither is good for my already bad mental health. So I wrote a resignation letter. After that they suggested to move me to administration instead of quitting, so I complied because that position interested me. Now recently they are sending me out to my old position again because they are short in staff. I did the task farely well for 1 week, so they sent me out again. So I took sick leave as my mental health really started acting up (throwing up, insomnia, apetite loss). Now I am overthinking all of it. As I have the right for a longer sick leave I am unsure how to break the news. Should I suggest them a last meeting where I explain my situation? Do I suck it up and just go to work?

1c5ns3y;Is my gestalt therapist / psychiatrist sus?;Gloomy_Freedom_5481;"I have been heavily depressed my whole life and as a result lost more or less everything. Started going to a shrink in March who is both a psychiatrist and therapist. He practices gestalt therapy and is clearly more in favor of therapy than meds.  He started me on lexapro 10 mg, that didnt work much, and he upped the dose to 20. That also had 0 effect. In our last session (after around 1.5 months on lexapro) I told him that I wanted to change to another antidepressant. He suggested I stay on lexapro but add mirtazapine (remeron) to it. I said that lexapro didnt work at all, so maybe it was better to try an SNRI (which in the past helped me and I told him that) or another SSRI. Some of the things he said to me:  - If one ssri didn't help you, then another won't either  - I don't think you're depressed, it's more like you have some other issues (shame, anger etc) that we need to work on in therapy  - Therefore I don't want to load you with drugs  - It's also not clear whether SNRI's will help  I was left a little dumbfounded, as I have been to many shrinks in my life and been constantly diagnosed with depression or bipolar. I didn't even know what to say, as I felt like for the first time I needed to convince a psychiatrist to prescribe me something. I mean not living my room, not following hygiene, not talking to people for weeks on end, sometimes skipping meals/hydration, having no sense of hope, being detached from the world etc must be the symptoms of depression, what else can it be? He also asks me strange questions like, is it you choice to not leave your room? Would you like to change that? Do you like it and etc.. I feel like he is trying to apply gestalt therapy where it doesnt fit - namely clinical depression  I told him that if he thinks that way he should diagnose me so that we have a proper treatment. And said that I would go all in with therapy and no meds if I didn't have to hold down a job. But in my current situation I need fast results in parallel with therapy.   I constantly feel that he doesn't click with me talking about ""depression"" and prefers more to talk about things like shame, guilt, anger etc (I dont deny having those, but they come together and result in depression). And I didn't understand what to make of him saying that he thinks I'm depressed (I've thought of myself as of a depressed person for the past 14-15 years.

1c5nnfr;I freeze when I am faced with decision;Oddity_266;So this is literally the story of my life. I have spent probably 2 months applying for a masters program in a different city. I was excited about going to a new city, going back to school, building a new foundation for opportunities, meeting new people. And well... i got in. I have researched opportunities for funding and know i will probably get it. I have talked to my job and I know that i will be a able to go on leave and then come back. I even have figured our where I will live. The conditions will never be more perfect.And now i am having cold feet. I am thinking this was a horrible idea, this will leave stranden and broke somewhere, it will ruin me economically, the degree is useless, no one else goes on leave for a masters because it is a terrible idea, and i will be one of those people who lost everything and live in loneliness and poverty due to one bad decision. I am thinking that i always have idiotic ideas because i cannot think properly. I am literally considering to withdraw the leave application. I am constantly nauseas, i wake up randomly at night with a lump in my throat. I cannot focus on anything. I am tense. I spend hours every aspect of every possible outcome, every reason why this is not a good idea, every program i could have applied for instead. Worst thing is, this is a pattern. I have been in almost identical situations before and withdrawn from exciting opportunities that would make me grow. And in hindsight, i regretted missing the opportunity deeply and wondered what i even was scared of. I have been beating myself up for letting go of opportunities, but now that i can make it right, get out there, grow personally and proffesionally, my whole system is telling me that this is dangerous. I have always been an over-thinker and risk averse, and grew up over-protected, but this is not normal. It's like I am 2 different people when I look for opportunities and when I am about to take the leap. Is anyone else dealing with similar stuff? Do you know what might be the source? How do you cope?;So this is literally the story of my life.

I was at my breaking point, one wrong thing and I'd end it all. Most of the time between those years I was neglected by my classmates and ""friends"", absolutely no one wanted to be with me and I still don't understand why.I did stand out from everyone else with my fashion sense and the way I generally expressed myself but that never was a problem earlier in life. I was actually praised and strangely worshiped for it. Once the neglect started to settle in I felt worse and worse by every single day. By 6th grade I had already made my plan for taking my life. I was planning on slitning my arms, legs, stomach, throat and then hang myself to either die form blood loss or strangulation.I would write in my journal on how at peace I'd feel when I finally did it. But I never did, I never got the energy to take action. ""I'll eventually do it, it will happen some day."" Thats what I told myself every time I thought about it.

1c5mr86;What’s this feeling on my chest? How do I deal with it?;Dotdotdut;Anxiety? Shame? Guilt? I can’t identify what I am feeling at the moment and it really annoys me. It is more or less where my neck and chest connect and it’s a feeling I can’t seem to turn off. I think I know when it started. I was going though a rough patch and was watching series as an escape. Then I spoiled myself and felt like I can’t even have this one moment of peace in my life. And I’ve become extremely sensitive after that.    It is fucking frustrating to live so hypervigilant about everything. Granted, no one likes spoilers, but the level to which I freak out makes absolutely no sense. And it hurts so deeply every time. Another consequence of that is my brain trying to link a bad experience I just had with an object/series/whatever that I like and ruins it for me. Suppose I had an argument the same day I’d bought a book I was really looking forward to. Now, I can’t help but be reminded of the bitter taste thatt he argument left me whenever I look at the book. I can only relate this to the tainted memories of the people going through divorces.    I end up in this horrible cycle: I fuck up, I feel bad, I want to avoid this horrible feeling, become reckless, do something dumb, fuck up more, feel worse, etc, you get the idea. And the fuck ups aren’t even that significant, I know it’s me blowing things out of proportion. But then again, I can’t help it. I can feel my mind trying to connect this bad sensation to something I value. And sometimes I just do nothing in order to avoid the connection, but I can’t just do nothing all the time.    I’ve been going to a therapist for over a year now and it has helped me a lot, but I feel that there’s an underlying problem that I can’t see or understand and I just want to rip it out of my chest. I also used to repress a lot of negative emotions in the past, so that’s definitely something I take into account. I’ve applied the techniques but they either don’t seem to work anymore or take too long. Some months ago I could deal with some of my thoughts but it exhausted me too much and my mind kept making up problem, so my efforts felt kinda pointless.    I can’t be the first or the only one going through this. Please, if someone knows how to label it or how to alleviate these symptoms, any advice in general, I would greatly appreciate it.

1c5mmsa;I feel immense shame from an event that happened 2 years ago and can't sleep at night, need a bit of reassurance;Glum_Captain123;"TW: depression, suApproximately 2 years ago, I (then 17F) had a brief romantic relationship with a girl. She was a friend of my friend's and I told her I thought she was cute, so she arranged a coffee meet-up when we could talk. For context, since early in life I knew I had some attraction to women, but it was mainly physical, so when I realised I actually ""felt"" a way about another girl, it made me excited and I thought I could finally call myself a ""proper"" bisexual (which is kind of stupid but that was my thought process). We went on a couple of dates and at some point she asked me to be her girlfriend - I agreed but in the back of my head I was very hesitant because I knew my family is strongly Christian and they would never approve. I was naive and swooped in the moment and didn't think about the potential consequences.From that day on, I started losing attraction - it's actually a pattern of mine which I wasn't fully aware of back then - I start to lose interest in a relationship whenever it gets serious. At some point, I became so scared (I no longer wanted to see the girl, etc., felt like I was faking the felling) and confused whether I was maybe actually straight. It was difficult for me to make sense of my feelings - at that point in my life I was very conflict-avoidant and depressed, even su, I had terrible brain fog to a point when I wasn't fully aware of how bad my actions were. One afternoon, I just sent a long text which said that ""I think I am actually straight and sorry I'm breaking up through text"". The thing is, I still don't know whether that's actually true. Still, when I was in high school, she ignored me on the school grounds (obviously), and the worst part is that she introduced me to her friends, when at that point I was already not sure about the relationship. I feel extremely bad for making a stupid, impulsive decision 2 years ago, and for breaking someone's heart. We only met up for approximately a month, but I can't stop thinking about it, I think about it every day. I feel awful for not realizing how bad this was when I was in high school, and that I still had the audacity to say ""hi"" to her on the corridors. There is a part of me that is scared that this will come out through gossip and everyone I know will hate me, or that she is actually severely depressed because I betrayed her trust. It sounds really bad, but I really need someone to tell me that it wasn't that bad, and that not everyone is out to get me because of it. There is an extra layer of shame because in my family homosexuality is very taboo, and my therapist is on sick leave - I haven't talked to her about this because I feel too bad...";TW: depression, suApproximately 2 years ago, I (then 17F) had a brief romantic relationship with a g;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;5;17;2024-04-16 17:56:18;2024-04-16;Tuesday;17:56:18;2677;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:52.030104

Is it the Prozac or am I just over it? ;SEAtoPHX;Preface: Just diagnosed with OCD two months ago, currently taking 40mg of Prozac daily.I've been in a relationship for about a year, and it hasn't exactly been smooth sailing. Our attachment styles clash—he's avoidant, I'm anxious, a challenging combination. Whenever things started looking up, he'd pull away, creating a frustrating one step forward, three steps back dynamic. These episodes led to intense emotions—upset, tears, panic, overthinking, intrusive thoughts, you name it. It felt like a monthly rollercoaster (exhausting, right?).Fast forward to this week, and we've ended things for good. Surprisingly, I'm not feeling sad. No tears, no panic attacks, no lashing out. Now I'm wondering, is it the Prozac blunting my emotions, or have I genuinely reached a point of indifference towards the emotional turmoil?;Preface: Just diagnosed with OCD two months ago, currently taking 40mg of Prozac daily.I've been in ;Opinion / Thoughts;2;3;2024-04-16 16:58:37;2024-04-16;Tuesday;16:58:37;822;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:52.033930
1c5ktgy;I need help;KunGa69;"Honestly, this is gonna sound really weird to everyone, but every time I masturbate my personality and the way I act changes. I've done research to see if I can find an answer but nothing I find helps. This is affecting me mentally as I keep changing each time, and I'm finding it hard to stop.I'll give an example, one day I was really happy and made good jokes, and the next after I masturbated I felt empty and the way I came across was different until I masturbated again, where it either made me happier or emptier. Another thing I notice is that my memory also gets very cloudy after and I find it hard to remember things and retain information. As a student who is studying for their final exams, this is a struggle for me.I believe that this theory started when I was younger. I noticed that the way I acted was different after masturbating and I thought that it was a good thing, thinking that if I didn't act the way I wanted, I could just ""reset"" and try again. This theory has adapted over the years and has become embedded into my mind, and I can't get rid of it.To most people, this sounds completely ridiculous, but for me, it's affecting me mentally in a way that's hard to explain to anyone else.

Then one of my friends unalived himself and at that point i thought nothing will get better. İ talked to her again she didn't give a flying fuck. So i asked her about that and she said to me i don't want to hear any problems anymore from anyone and i was like okay but thats a dick move. And she literally stopped talking to me for 5 months. And today i wanted to catch up with her she just treated me like i was an enemy and a bad person and she said she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore because i had unsolvable problems in my life for some time and always talked to her.

1c5ksrr;I'm 27 and I feel like I have not much time left;Okay_Affect_6390;I'm 27 and I feel like I have not much time left anymore to succeed and find a way of living a truly fulfilling life. I think this pressures me so heavily because I always felt very scared of not finding a girlfriend for example because when I was younger (14 - 19) I had acne very badly and also isolated myself in my room. I always thought that I was too ugly to get a girlfriend and internalized this to the point of thinking about ways how to substitute that already when I was about 15. Then I got a intensive treatment for my acne at 19 and miracoulisly didn't get very noticable scars and was actually feeling very attractive for the first time. But the feeling of being ugly or like theres something wrong with me never left and even transitioned to other things about my appearance, like that I worry about smiling in an unattractive way, or that my mimic looks unsympathetic in general. All of this didnt motivate me to go out more in my twenties. Now I still have HEAVY problems with feeling confident about myself and making eye contact with girls who even seem to like me sometimes. I openly stared at a girl like I was mad at her when she smiled and waved at me last week. And before that I was even thinking of liking this girl a lot. She fullfilled my inner wish of noticing me and I talked myself into, that she would mean her friends who sat behind me, but I knew that she didnt and she really didnt. This behaviour of myself has been going on for so long. Everytime there is a moment like this I break it apart in my head and sabotage it, instead of trusting myself that I would be okay in trying to smile back at her for example. And I'm scared that now that Im 27 it will become less likely that I will become more confident at being open and vulnerable.

1c5k3to;How do I know if I’m the problem or the job is;isAndyOK;I’ve been unhappy with my job.Although I am lucky I can be honest with my boss about my feelings most of the time, and they seemed like they’re trying to accommodate my feedback, I believe there are things that I fundamentally dislike about the company that I can’t breathe working there another minute. I used to respect my boss a lot, untilI started working for them, I learned more about them and realize there are values I just cannot agree with. I don’t think they care about people (clients and staff). I don’t think they trust us as professionals, most of the time I feel like a robot doing what they ask because our plan gets rejections. I understand it’s their company, but it really makes me feel forced and unhappy.I’ve been thinking about quitting for months….But you know the job market isn’t good now, financially this paycheck is crucial. And most importantly, I blame myself sometimes. Because I left my last job with the almost same reasons: “I’m unhappy/our values don’t align”. Sometimes I practice a mindset change in myself so I can take things less personally, and just do the job without any emotion. But every time, something annoying,  proving the unaligned values popped up and I wanted to quit again. I’m afraid this is a “pattern” of me although this is only my second job.I know the company isn’t the best place to be though. Most of my coworkers say the same things but everyone staying is also stuck. Once I saw someone I don’t know on the internet sharing about their bad experiences working with the company before and many comments followed with same opinion, I felt so relieved. I felt like I got confirmation that I’m not crazy.I even did a tarot reading whether or not I should quit now, and if it’s my “pattern”. The reader assure me if I have a plan then quit, and that the company is at fault. A month later… I’m still here. I’m struggling to come up with a plan(the most I can think of is to freelance).

1c5jzrp;I don’t even know;ChefTy_;I wanna start this by saying, this war sucks. You maybe asking “what what?” Let me assure you, I don’t mean war as in physical, I mean the mental war here inside of my head, my spirit, soul, inside of… me. Have you always felt like a failure? Have you always been one to always come up short on expectations? Oh, have you always felt like everything you pour passion into reaps nothing? Or how about always feeling betrayed, because the people you surround yourself with don’t have good intentions? Me either, I haven’t always felt like this, but here recently I have. Why? Why is that every time I get motivated to do something, that flame gets put out almost instantly. Why do I never get the flame to burn? Why when I set expectations for myself, I can’t meet them? Why? Why do I suffer with always making mistakes and not enough victories to even that out? Am I piece of shit? Am I really the problem? Why is that I feel like everything I do amounts to nothing? It fucking sucks, I basically feel invisible as a human sometimes. Like I know work is work, but like damn, I be busting my ass in the back, and I can’t even get like a good job from the morning cook? All she does is bitch about something I didn’t do to her standard, and then she goes over the work I just did, (I.e. flipping pans.) Like that’s kinda insulting in a way, because damn I just did all that, and now I feel like my work wasn’t good enough. But not even just that, like omg was I annoying, a real piece of work from ages like 12-22, just flat out a shit bag to not sugar coat. But now I’m 25 and for the past 2 years I’ve been genuinely trying to learn about the world, others, myself, emotions, all that. But like I feel like I’ve come a looooong way, yes I’ve got a lot more to go, but like no one’s proud of me? No one has noticed? Does that mean I’m still shitty? Have I not improved? Like what is it?  And along with that… Honestly, what is it? Really? Do I stink? Am I ugly? Is it my job? Is it my lack of license? Is it the way I dress? Why is it so hard to love? Well more like find love? I’m not chasing and I’m not desperate by any means, but why have I not found my person? I’ve been told how sweet I am, I’ve been told that it’s surprising I’m single and stuff like that, but if I’m soo sweet, and attractive, or whatever right? Then why? Where is she? Are people just lying to me? Because I feel like, I have sooooo much to give, and not to be that guy, but I genuinely mean that whoever my person is, will love it on this side. But with that being said, where is she? I take pride in my personal hygiene, and I try my best to do well with my funds, adulting isn’t easy. But with that being said, is that it? I have trouble with funds, is it my job, or my spending habits… Ouuhh what about both? Is that a reason to not like me or make you want to approach me? Because I work at Denny’s and don’t have $1M? Is it because I’m 25 having a crisis? I don’t understand, maybe I really am just a bum.  Speaking of bum, why do I struggle with even getting my day started? I just wake up and ‘ehhh’. No plans, no friends, no nun, just eh. Even when it comes to hopping on the game, or even when I do have plans. I’ll hop on the game, excited to play, but then as soon as I hop on, I kinda go through my games, then the store, then my games again, and then shut it off. Or like I’ll be at DnD ready to play, then we get to playing, and it’s like ehhh I don’t really want to now. I don’t how my mind even changes that quickly, I gotta be stupid or something. Ohhhh, speaking of stupid… me! Why is it soooo hard to even get out of a slump? It’s almost like I like being in it, but I don’t, I absolutely fucking hate it. And it’s not fair to others that have to deal with that. People like my roommate D, my friend C, and my co worker I. It’s not fair because when I’m in slump, my mood changes. I’m sad, kinda just moving about. I’m quiet, because I’m in my own head and I don’t want to come off any kind of way to anybody. And I’m just not fun to be around. Definitely not ideal to work with in that mood, because it could make work awkward, some miscommunication could cause problems with food being bad or something. Or what about to live with? Oh god, that’s not fair to be the only one contributing to the house. And let’s not forget what that has to feel like to my friend? Probably a little akward because I sit there in silence, or am just not feeling any game we’re playing or whatever.  At the end, I’m losing this war. And I’m at breaking point to where it’s hard to hide my emotions. I’m just exhausted, and with life being hard, with me being an over emotional mess, an overthinker, and with me having lack of self, it doesn’t make this shit any easier. Even more than that, I feel so lonely, and so lost. I know my life could be worse, I could be in much worse circumstances, but it definitely doesn’t feel that way.God do I miss the days being happy, always being the life of the party. Hopefully one day I’ll be normal again.;I wanna start this by saying, this war sucks.

I went to a psychologist once because I had some trouble with friends in elementary school and it didn't help me much.I think i have bpd, abandonment issues, trust issues and depresion moods. Everytime, I found friend i felt like they're leaving me, because they always did. Everytime I wanted them to prove me that they're not leaving me. I had diffrent mindset than now. It was more like explosive behaviour, I acted mad a lot and I didn't know ""my bpd"" was a problem because noone told me. (I didn't even knew it's a thing)Let's move on to, what happend now. So on high school I kinda created seven members friend group (not just me ofc) and I loved them all but one of the friend group was my favorite person and she was my bestfriend, but I always felt like she's leaving me, because she have a lot of friends and I just felt like she don't need me, im not good enought for her and she will leave me. So I was kinda toxic to her and wanted her to prove me that she likes me and everything. She distanced herself from me because of this, and then I was even more toxic and left me. But I didn't know why.My another favorite person was second girl from that group and she left me later too..but I didn't even do much to her it was more like her manipulation. When she left me I realized that, maybe i have bpdRn my favorite person is my a little older long distance bf and since he's older and is that one therapeutic friend I told him everything. I had my first bpd and abandonment issues conversation with him and we agreed on what we will do to make everything work for us, for our feelings, so neither of us need feel bad. My thinking became much more mature with him.A few days ago, they told me and one other person in the group to never talk to them again. But I will have to see them everyday in school for next 2,5 year and I feel like it was more like bad conversation and they just wanted manipulate with me.So my situation rn..i feel like I can't speak with anyone from my family, my bf is long distance and i have just one friend (that one from ""our"" group), I distanced myself from my other friends because im not good enought, I lost interested in doing my hobbies, I have more free time than I should have, I will have to see that group everyday in school for next 2 years and half. I don't want to be bad friend and even more bad girlfriend anymore and I don't want to feel useless anymore What should I do and am I fr bad and hopeless?";So, Im 16 nearly 17 yo F and im I am in my 2nd year of high school.

1c5jmg7;Got to give my doggo away. ;TryMaleficent2171;I can’t do this anymore. I got laid off my job a few months ago and ever since then things have gone to shit. Have applied for unemployment benefits and food stamps and haven’t received anything yet. Both of my parents have died within the last two years and my mother as recently as two months ago. I got evicted and am living in a McDonalds parking lot practically with my dog. I can barely even feed him. Sometimes strangers will give me a little cash and I put it towards getting him food but I plan on dropping him off at the shelter tomorrow so he can live a life he deserves. There’s so much wrong with my car that I can’t even use it anymore. Both front and back brakes are fucked up, need a new wheel bearing, and I have another tire that is completely flat. I moved 13 hours away for a job and didn’t even get to see my mom before she died and it absolutely kills me. My dog has been here for me and it breaks my heart I have to give him away but I know it’s in his best interest. Can’t pay my phone bill so the only way it works is with this McDonald’s wifi. I’m just tired of living, I can’t live like this anymore and I plan on jumping off the bridge tonight and ending my life. I have nothing to lose. I just can’t live like this anymore and am absolutely miserable everyday. Tried to call a few friends back home and nobody besides one picked up. He offered me a place to a live in california and a job but he knows I can’t get to california. I think it was just to get me to keep going but I’m so defeated.;I can’t do this anymore.

1c5j4nh;Help! Seeing my family makes me anxious;Focused-fish;What I am going to post kind of hurts but I need to let it out. I live very far away from my family now bc I got married, in almost three years I’ve seen my parents twice but those two times I felt so so stressed out, I was shaking for a couple of days, it was the second time when i noticed how anxious seeing them made me. I resent them for lots of reasons some shitty some not so much, but one in particular happened like four years ago, my dad told me he knew my siblings and I would always depend on him, almost rolling his eyes, my mom has told me I’m dumb and gray in the past and how not having hardship makes you stupid and not worthy of attention or love. My parents were very poor growing up, they went through very dangerous situations to say the least. The thing that irks me is that they are engaging in very classist mindsets, what annoys me the most is them making hurtful comments or being condescending, I think I take it personal bc I myself was told similar things by other people almost all my life. I’m a very shameful person, I scrutinize almost everything I do like the jobs I take, my opinions, even the music I listen to, and somehow I feel like I am the worst. Whenever I see them the shame increases. I’ll take advice or feedback, I mostly wanted to let it out and discuss if someone has felt the same.;What I am going to post kind of hurts but I need to let it out.

I feel like I act relatively normal and if anything more reserved in social settings for fear of being seen as “try hard”.

I've been like this for almost a year and I'm really frustrated about this. The thing is if i lose this, i feel like i don't have any value (which isn't true but yeah).It started when i entered the college for the first time, the assignments make me hella busy so i kinda ""forgot"" to do creative stuff. Maybe the reality of adulthood hit me a little and make me focusing on real life more than my hobby. But, I don't think that writing is only a hobby, it has become a part of my life. I started to write things at 9 y/o and continue until a year ago (18 y/o). I grew up with it. It's my whole life but now I'm losing it.I've tried so many ways to make me feel more engaged to it but i just couldn't. Everytime i read a novel or poetry my mind says, ""Look, they can do it. Why can't you?"" Everytime i try to make a poetry my heart just aches, even now i feel the same. I want to have my ability back but i unconsciously avoiding to write things. I'm not sure but, i hate it but i still want it. It makes me feel so miserable. It's effecting my life especially in this last three months I really am clueless about my situation right now, nobody seems to understand. They just keep telling to try, I'm trying, I've tried, but nothing works! It's really annoying you know. And i feel like I'm starting to grow a hatred to it and also me because i couldn't fix it.

1c5gzwj;Battling my own self;annaltac;"A couple of weeks ago I was rejected by my prom partner. Understandably so, as she did have a boyfriend. It also seemed like she liked me, but maybe I was led on.I took this rejection personally though, as I genuinely thought I had a chance with her from all the signs she was giving me. At one point I had the chance to make a move on her, but hesitated to do so, as I was questioning my morality. I was also somewhat scared of messing up, and I was listening to my friend's advice who said I should pursue  a relationship with her after prom (so that things weren't awkard). Deep inside though I knew I had to do it now. I wanted to make that move, have that kiss, cuddle and experience a first sign of love. But I never did. That was the only time I could have done anything, and i reasoned my way out of it. My window of opportunity ran out.This first hesitation lead to doubt and then anxiety.  It really started to show everytime I was with her. I started to become moody and anxious around her, which was not a good energy to give. Prom night itself was fun, but throughout the night she could sense negativity radiating from me, as the only thing I thought about was how to not lose her, even though I never had her in the first place. Basically, I wasn't fully living in the present moment and in retrospect, I wish I was, because how many prom nights are you gonna have in your life?After prom, I finally told her in person that I had feelings for her, to which she replied with ""This isn't a good time, you know I have a boyfriend.""Holidays came around and I continued to text her, until she finally blocked me on socials. And thats it.Looking back all I see is failure. I had a similar situation with another girl several years ago and I had made the same mistake as I did with this one. I never made the move. I started fantasising what could have been and what if I had done one simple thing like wrapping my arm around her or the touching her on her thigh or plafully tugging with her hair. But I did nothing.  It drove me crazy. The idea of 'what if' made me so resentful not at her, but at myself because I knew i let an opportunity fly by.To make it worse, I feel like I created a self fulfilling prophecy, where my own negativity drowned out any connection I had with her. And I was fully aware of this the whole time, I'm not sure what to do anymore. It feels like I'm stuck in a place of physical tension and uneasiness about my self. The doubting & questioning has only gotten louder over the weeks and it is taking over the way I interact with myself and the world. I don't trust myself anymore. I don't trust getting my work done and don't trust talking to people. i don't trust on planning or thinking for myself. Mentally it feels as though I have lost a part of myself, which makes me feel inadequate. This inadequacy is making me fixate on all the negativity in my life and making me feel worthless. Not too long ago I could visualise a life that I wanted for myself and pursue it. Now the depth of my thinking only extends to what others think of me. I am developing social anxiety again and I do not want to go back to living in anxiety and self-consciousness, where you feel like you're surviving instead of thriving.Reading back on this it looks like I'm overreacting, but I have lost the plot and don't know how to go back to normal. It's like I forgot how to be me and have let emotions take over. Advice would be great right now. Thank you for reading through.";A couple of weeks ago I was rejected by my prom partner.

1c5gwme;She told me “you cause me to want to k*ll myself.”;Im_fckin_geniuz;To start this off, this has been just eating away at me. Part of it is indeed my fault for being unwilling to listen, part of it due to off and on addiction. But, no matter what I do, the end result never changes.When I was 18 months old, I was adopted from two 16-17 year olds at the time. Around age 4 or 5, the adoption was finalized. My adoptive mother, we’ll call her Kristin, and my adoptive father, we’ll call him Mark, both refuse to talk to me due to an incident on nye that led to me being homeless and forcing me to move 8 hours away (I swear this is relevant).Preceding the incident, a week to a week and half earlier if I remember correctly (my memory has been deteriorating due to my financial inability to begin therapy), 4 days before Christmas, I came home like normal from my night job at the time (usually between 3 and 5 pm to close, which would span from 12:30-2 am). I walk into my mom and dad’s room after a really shitty night and talk to them after arguing with Kristin over text, per usual. But, something was different about our screaming match this time. Something that bewildered and blindsided me. Something I would never expect. Kristin and Mark are strong believers in Christianity (I am agnostic), and growing up, would constantly push the “drugs are bad” agenda. But, when I walked into that room, something changed….I walk into the room, and of course, get scolded by mark for being so “rude” to Kristin, which I expected. What I didn’t expect were the 2 dab pen batteries and three medical grade dab carts sitting in her open drawer. That’s not even the straw that broke the camel’s back. One of the carts was a 92% THC cart, the highest percentage I’ve ever seen ever. EVER!! Keep in mind, before we really got into it, she told me it was CBD and even reassured me that it was indeed.So, of course, I blew up. I was broken by the hypocrisy I was witnessing. I was destroyed by the lies being told right to my face about them. I trusted them! With everything I had. Just for them to prove my bio dad right about them being conniving… So, I waltz outside and call my best friend at the time (we don’t talk anymore due to him showing his true colors back in Feb). We talked for 45 minutes until I actually calmed down enough where tears were streaming and only small sharp inhales were audible. I wrote an entire song about wanting to just end it instead of actually doing it. Thank god for that, right…? I wrote for two whole hours, which felt like minutes, and cried myself to sleep at 2 maybe 3 am.That next morning, 10:30 rolls around and I get woken up by them and told to come to the living room. I was half expecting an apology, or something other than what I got. What I got was another scolding, another gaslighting, another “your mother and I have never done anything wrong to you”. Then those faithful fucking words came out. “Son, you cause me to want to kill myself”. Saying that I simply broke is an understatement. I honestly have no idea how to put into words what that feeling felt like. Numbness, but pure emotion. My skin still crawls thinking about those damn words. Those pitiful 8 fucking words that could’ve stayed where they were. She could’ve talked to her therapist, why the fuck did I have to hear it?? Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the day.Fast forward to nye. My brother, their only biological son together, was allowed to throw an nye party, something I would never have been given the chance to discuss with them. And, I get it. He’s a golden child that is by far way more mature than me. I mean, growing up, I was a selfish drug addict asshole. So, maybe it was a long time coming. Anyway, I came home from where ever it was that I went (the memory of where I went is not coming to me), and in the garage are my brother and mark.Mark spoke up and asked what my plans were, so I told him I was going to hang out with them until 11 pm, then go meet my girlfriend and other friend at a gay bar to spend new years with them (I don’t like drinking often, but the time felt right for some reason). So mark looked me in my eyes and said, “why don’t you go do that now?” So, I restated that I was going to hang out with my brother and then I will go.Long story short, another screaming match. Another made up story. Another bucket of tears, anger, depression and whatever other emotion came to me. Another pity party of manipulation from Kristin, only I didn’t let it fly this time. As a result, I was kicked out for the final time.Kristin came into my room after I stormed off and locked my door after Mark and my brother told me what they did. And if you’re wondering what they said, I will explain in just a minute. It’s a well constructed, well thought out lie, so it was definitely swimming for a while.But, I digress. Kristin finally convinced me to open the door and let her in. She shuts it behind her and proceeds to try and brainwash me by twisting what she had said to me a week prior. She told me that she “REALLY” said was, “your actions cause me to want to die.” So, I blew up worse than before. I didn’t let her get another fucking word out. Not one. I told her exactly word for WORD what the fuck she said to me. She wasn’t having it, and neither was Mark, who happened to storm in after me getting progressively more and more heated. It finally came down to the wire and Mark put his foot down and said “get out of my house.” I nodded sharply and said “okay”. I walked in and out of that house at least 6 times making sure I grabbed everything I owned. While I’m doing all this, I’m blatantly talking about everything that happened to my girlfriend on the phone, on speaker so they can hear me. Maybe it was a revenge thing. Maybe it was the feeling of satisfaction watching my narcissistic, piece of shit, sorry excuse of a mother finally showing her true fucking colors in public as I kept the front door wide open. The only thing she said to me after she realized she had lost was get out over and over and over, as loud and obnoxiously as she could.Before I finished retrieving everything I owned, my brother came to my door, face red as a tomato with nothing but tears in his eyes. You know what he said to me? After how long we’ve known each other? After all the years of building the relationship we have had? “You should’ve never come here.” THAT is the last thing my brother ever PHYSICALLY said to me.So, I walked. I got in my car, and drove the fuck off, not looking back. Went to my normal spot I sleep at in my car, and tried to cry. Nothing. I kept trying. Nothing. I called my bio mom, talked to her. Nothing.Then, it hit me. I wasn’t sad. I wasn’t depressed more than I was angry. The feeling I felt back then? It was relief. Relief knowing that Kristin could NEVER be able to manipulate me again, for I can now see through the bullshit. My blindness to it had receded. My willingness to play along to preserve peace had completely diminished, for I had met the REAL Kristin that day.And, as for what their lie was… Jack (my brother), had come up with the lie that his girlfriend’s parents didn’t want me there because of my age. When in all actuality, they literally could’ve just said that I couldn’t be there bc of his friends’ age group. THAT was the truth, which I learned not even a week ago.So, to close this out. I am not going to be manipulated, lied to, controlled, or otherwise be told what to do by a GODDAMN soul other than my own. My actions will be based on my own volition, not some manipulative kindergarten teacher who talks about her students more than her own fucking son. I am the one putting myself to sleep at night. I am the one staying up late filled with anger and self hatred that suddenly spawns from nowhere. I am the one that will decide my fate. Not her. Not Mark. Not anyone.As for right now, I am doing better living with my real mom. Sure, I have spats with my siblings, but that’s normal, right? I have a job. I have my car. I have money. But most importantly, I have a parental figure who seems to actually give a shit when something bothers me, rather than blowing me off. And for that, I’m grateful.;To start this off, this has been just eating away at me.

1c5gh16;very long rant about the clinic secretary calling my parent about me wanting to get help;Remarkable-Gold9217;"throwaway account because I know he monitors my main acc. I'm so mad, so so mad right now, I got home and sat down to eat dinner with my father and sister when suddenly my mother barged in and very loudly asked me about if I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist at the clinic, I'm pissed off, my father is very clingy, believes he knows everything about me and my mother intentionally did this infront of him so that we'd end up fighting over it, she loves to cause chaos, he is well meaning but has a lot of mental health problems himself, I probably inherited a few tbh. her plan worked, after barging in, revealing everything, I was faced with an onslaught of questions I was not ready to answer in front of him.   I went 2 weeks ago to schedule an appointment as I have various issues I really don't want to get into with this long ass paragraph. I forgot that it was coming up and to confirm the appointment they called my MOTHER, NOT ME????????? even though I explicitly told the front desk/secretary that my number had ""changed"" this was a clinic I used to go to a lot for an ophthalmologist as a child, its been a while so they asked to confirm my number which I realised was my mother and told them to update it to mine for my account and that that number was ""dead"".   I immediately saw the way things changed with how my father looked at me, it wasn't the same anymore, I didn't want him to find out I was going, I've been saving up my allowance for weeks so I could pay for this first visit with cash, I have a good relationship with him but he doesn't believe in medication or therapy, I tried gently broaching the subject with him in the past but he's completely engulfed with the alternative medicine route, read a Krishna murti/ sadghuru/ any other self help spirituality book (sorry, I really don't know how to spell their names and only hear them as my dad talks to me about it for 4+hours.) as that has helped all his problems, (it has not, I'm his therapist in a way and yes thats another thing that gets to me). medication is dangerous and should not be trusted as it is all chemicals (vaccines are fine tho, in fact he's planning on getting me a hpv shot before I become sexually active, oh sweet summer chile}  he is constantly talking about what a wonderful father he is and how he's nothing like his father. but he's far to clingy and dependant on me emotionally, as in SEVERE emotional incest, he isn't a helicopter parent he's a Boeing 737 parent, he searches my room and never lets me forget about it, he found a buttplug I hid under my mattress once, suction cupped it to the middle of my desk and put a post it note with ""don't forget to wash it in between uses :)"" like wow ok, I do, but, I did not need him telling me that but thats not the problem here. I have to talk him down from doing rash things, I have to be his springboard for all his problems since I was a pre-teen. my mother punched me in the head so hard as a child because my father was holding me and she was missed trying to aim for my his head not mine, she didn't intend to hit me and brought me to the hospital so she didn't do anything wrong.   she's abus!ve towards him but no one believes it. they managed to separate legally but still live together because she cant face being alone and people knowing her marriage ended. she forced my father to see a therapist friend of hers that she convinced before hand that he was super bad and needed to essentially be on tranquillisers 24/7 and he did them for years before stopping since it was too much for his body and the side effects got bad so she let him stop. he believes the same thing would happen to me and that id be drugged and rendered a vegetable like he was. but life has gotten too out of hand I cant cope and need professional help badly,i feel like its gotta be adhd btw I cant focus on shit, I never know the day or time, and also my paediatricians used to say I had ADHD whenever we visited for my flu shots.  in the end my father is still super mad I kept it a secret from him and that he's the good one and I should only have secrets from my mother only as she's the bad one, but said he'd be willing to help pay for some of my appointments as long as I promise not to take any meds and to only go to a psychologist not a psychiatrist and to stay far away from psychiatrists and that id only be allowed to go as long as he stays in the room with me the whole time. I wanted to be independent and do it myself but it's kind of a win maybe. my dad said maybe the clinic called her since I'm still too young to be doing adult things like scheduling and should have asked him to do it instead next time since I'm not yet old enough to be considered an adult and that they needed a parents consent.   oh also I'm 25M on my second year of college, I repeated couple of times for reasons, also I didn't realise I straight up wasn't attending an entire day's worth of lectures each week for an entire semester and on record they only show me showing up on the day of the exam itself (60/80 so still passed but considered failed as I didn't attend any of the meeting or did any other schoolwork), I only found out on the day I went after the term break, I walked in, didn't remember what classroom I went to, like I went up to one, the lights were off, the air-conditioning wasn't running even tho its hot as fuck out there, thought maybe there weren't classes and I just didn't remember any announcement. found it after taking a look at my schedule again, and the teacher literally pulled me aside to ask what happened to me, even my other classmates where kinda shocked to see me, HOW AM I LOSING AN ENTIRE DAY CONSISTENTLY WITHOUT KNOWING, I'm fucking shocked but also cant remember any of my Thursdays, I just leave the house, step into campus, blank, nothing, nada, then remember getting on the bus home.kinda wanna yell at something but also kinda wanna crawl under my bed and never come out again, overall not the worst day of my life";throwaway account because I know he monitors my main acc.

1c5g5kd;Waking up with bad anxiety every day the past week after meeting a girl whom I really like;NumberOfTheBeast2112;"I have struggled with anxiety in the past, but had been doing well in the past few months. I should preface this by saying I ended a 2.5 year relationship back in February. Things had been rocky since the previous November, and I don't regret ending it at all. It gave me huge relief and allowed me to focus on bettering myself. This past week, I met a new girl whom I really like. We have been texting non-stop and have a date planned for when she's done her exams. I get the feeling that she really likes me as well, and texting her has been amazing.    Here's the problem; ever since I started texting her, I have been waking up with bad anxiety that persists throughout most of the day (usually fades a bit in the evening). It has affected my appetite and my overall happiness. I keep trying to tell myself that this is a positive step in my life, something I am sure I'm excited and happy about, so why is it causing me so much anxiety? It got to a point a few days ago when I saw her text in the morning, I felt like I was going to throw up. I met my ex in a similar fashion (online dating) but didn't feel like this back then even though she was my first partner. I do admittedly feel much more of an instant connection with this new girl than I did with my ex at the time, which is maybe why I'm getting more anxious about it.  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to be having to deal with this every day as it is very unpleasant. I have a therapy session booked tomorrow which should hopefully help, and I have been doing my best to meditate or organize my thoughts. My parents have been very supportive, as they also struggle with anxiety but I'm just getting really tired of feeling like this. I told this new girl that I struggle with anxiety sometimes and that I've been experiencing it in the past week (I didn't mention that I think it's because I met her), and she has been very compassionate and supportive about it. I do feel comfortable talking to her about it, but not sure if it would be a good idea to tell her I think my anxiety is caused by my excitement towards getting to know her. I think this could maybe make me feel better, but I don't want to weird her out or anything lol.    TL:DR I have met a new girl that I really like, but it has been causing me daily anxiety even though it is a positive step in my life.

1c5g4xf;Advice on how to move forward;Adventurous-Gap8596;A few warnings: suicide, eating disorders, and depression are mentioned So I’m currently at my second semester at my university as a first year student. My grades have always been fine and even to what I would consider excellent up until two weeks ago. Since January, my mental health has declined significantly. I’ve been to the hospital for OD on alcohol in an attempt to kill myself and was placed in the psych ward for five days. I have a history of major chronic depression, and for some reason this last semester has been extremely difficult to navigate due to my mental health. I’ve lost almost 40 pounds since January and have restricted my eating for almost 8 months now. I’ve also had a history with bulimia and received a diagnosis for ednos when I was in middle school. Anyway, I’m sure you get the point that I’m really sick. I’ve been to the on campus resources for help but at this point I don’t know if I can continue the semester. I’d rather fail each class and start my journey to healing. However, I am also currently on the GI bill and I’m worried that if I fail all my classes it might put financial strain on my shoulders with debt. (I might have to pay it back) The problem is I am so sick at the moment deep into anorexia and depression that I’ve considered the idea that I may need to go back to the psych ward and stay for a longer period of time because I haven’t eaten in four days and I’m seriously considering suicide again while also struggling to live day to day as I constantly feel dizzy as if I’m going to pass out any day now. I’m on two medications and I’ve take five times the prescribed amount dosage for my antidepressant honestly wondering if it will kill me someday. Ultimately, I just wanna be okay. I think I should go back into psychiatric care and get help for my eating disorder and suicidal thoughts. I’m just very concerned about my coursework it’s the end of the semester but I genuinely don’t think I can continue. I am completely fine with failing my classes, but what should I do so I don’t put more financial strain on myself? Does anyone know about GI rules and exceptions? Also what should I do regarding my mental health? Is it a good idea to go to the hospital again?;A few warnings: suicide, eating disorders, and depression are mentioned So I’m currently at my secon;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-16 13:29:35;2024-04-16;Tuesday;13:29:35;2225;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:53.240863

Today, about an hour ago, I thought a Christmas decoration was a scary face. I only thought it was for about half a second before I realised what it actually was and relaxed. The trouble is this has set my paranoia to a peak. It looked like one of those schizophrenia drawings, you might know the ones, and I'm terrified of developing thought-degrading mental illnesses - especially schizophrenia. To top it off, I walked by a sibling's room and spotted a rubber mask on the floor. I knew they owned it, but I thought it was in a different spot on the floor. I'm fighting the thoughts that it moved by itself.For a bit of extra information, I've been fairly sleep deprived in the past week.

1c5g294;Should I continue to see my Psychologist or rely on my therapist?;Choco_Tree;Hello! Been really stuck on what to do, been told years ago by my therapist to evaluate if I may have ADHD. Two years later I go to a Psychiatrist and told that I have adhd along with other disorders.The whole thing felt invasive, and it felt like it reopened more wounds and left me more terrified ever after hearing the side effects of the medication the doc prescribed. They were also surprised hearing how my therapist never actually diagnosed me with anything.After meeting my therapist the week after she said that most of my symptoms were more off my anxiety. She wasn't exactly against medication just more wary of it as its not always a solution. But told me whatever route I choose medication or not is my choice. Now I'm conflicted on what I want to do, on one hand I want to know if there's something wrong with me and if I can fix it. And a psychiatrist gave those answers quickly. While I've known and talk to my therapist for years and have felt more open and able to talk to her better. What should I do? Would It be wrong to just only see my therapist?

1c5fzdk;Get a therapist;Drunk_Lemon;My mother often talks about some traumas she experienced decades ago, with the most recent one being about 20 years ago. Evidently she is still negatively affected by them which causes issues in how she handles disagreements. This leads to her blowing all disagreements out of proportion and saying negative comments about herself as well as deciding to just throw everything out when she gets upset. I am unsure why she throws a lot of things out when she gets upset, given she does so without any regard to what she or others in the house wants, although she does avoid throwing out things that only belong to someone else but not things owned collectively. Anyway, she is a baby boomer and while she views mental health issues the same way someone might view an infection, in regards to it being normal to get treatment. She does not believe she needs a therapist when my brothers and I think she does. Any ideas on how to convince her to see a therapist? Also if it helps we live in the US and are white.

To give a bit of a backstory I'm a 26M who's been struggling greatly with my mental health for the past couple years, especially within this last year. I've been distancing myself from family, and have isolated myself from almost everyone (excluding my work friends who I see almost daily at work), and have no idea how to approach the situation of reaching out to others now that I've gotten myself in a more stable position. So how the hell do you start a conversation after isolating for so long? Let alone allow yourself to open up to someone. It's scary to think about. I know I've been treating those close to me poorly and want to make amends. But what if I've completely ruined the relationships with people I love and care for? What if they don't want to talk to me ever again? What if I've hurt them so badly and apologies aren't enough? I know logically all I need to do is open up a conversation and see where that takes us, but what can I say? How can I start a convo with the amount of fear I have going into it?Have any of you been in a similar situation, how did you handle it? Any and all advice is appreciated!

You're 100 % allowed to shit on me.I guess i just dont know how to talk to professionals and it scares me that's why i havent tried.I've been feeling suicidal ideations the last couple of months. It started five months ago when I was out drinking with a friend. We went to a party with people he knew ( alot of druggies.)My friend has always had issues with drugs. I've tried some before but didnt enjoy it so I was alwaysFor some reason i wanted to fit in so I also took the drugs they were taking. It was the most primal rush i've ever had and it made completely rabid.I sat down In the sofa and there was a woman there (also on drugs like the rest). She leaned on me and for some reason i just started to grab her. She said no and I stopped and apologized. Ofc this sparked some reactions from the people at the party but they let it go rather quickly. Eventually i started to get more and more neurotic about this as time was passing cause I realized what an asshat i was to my fiancée and the woman. I left the party when I felt like enough was enough (i wasnt feeling good anyways so why stay). Walking home i had delusions that I was gonna get completely canceled and lose everything. I thought the people at the party were gonna let everyone in my life know and make me lose my job etc.I went home to my fiancee and told her everything and that I wanted to kill myself (i thought it was the only way out of this nightmare at that point, cause i thought i was about to get canceled). My fiancée called my friend and asked what the substance was. My friend told me that the cancel thing was delusions.The day after was probably my worst day ever. My mental health has been bad but i've never felt like this. I managed to make her feel like shit and also make another woman feel unsafe. Ofc it wasnt easy for my fiancée to accept (it still isnt for me). She loves me and she forgave me after time and work. I love her so much and I dont deserve her for this but I made sure to try to become a better person.

There were only a few, probably the most mild it’s ever been. He angrily said “that better not be some emo shit” and tried to make me show him my arm. Loudly. In front of my sister. Thankfully I don’t think she realised what happened. After I refused to show him, he dropped it and didn’t say anything the rest of the day. I felt so sick, I couldn’t stand being near him. I was constantly on the verge of tears, just praying that he wouldn’t say anything. That he’d forget. The rest of the day he acted like nothing happened. Not even the slightest hint that anything took place. It’s been around a month since and he hasn’t said anything. I expected him to say something. He didn’t. No texts either. As much as I was surprised, I was so relieved. I still am I guess. I mean I wanted so desperately for him to forget. But I have to be honest. My heart hurts. He saw the cuts on my arm. And he got angry, made a stupid comment, publicly embarrassed me, and then acted like none of it ever happened. My own brother. I keep thinking about what I’d do in his position. I just can’t imagine never speaking to them about it, never doing anything to stop it or acknowledge it at least. I feel so incredibly unimportant and unloved. I have never felt more alone and uncared for. Yet some part of me is relieved.  I just can’t help thinking. If he had hugged me. Told me that it would be okay. That I don’t have to do this. That he loved me. Anything at all. Or nothing. Not a word. If he had just held me. If I had just felt loved for even a moment. I don’t think I would have had the strength to pick up a blade ever again. But I have. And I can’t fool myself into believing there’s an end in sight anymore.

I know this might not be the normal question in here and that many people have harder problems, but for me this made me devastated. I've been suffering with self loathing since then and low self-esteem, my head keeps repeating what my employer said about me not able to make it elsewhere in the future, I feel like my whole self image has been deeply challenged because of this. I cannot even perform normally in my new job because of this. How do I get out of this? How do I convince my brain that this's really a problem with my employer not with me?

Yet my mother took him in after 3 months in jail (WTF!!)and she claimed she lied to the cops about it and a year or 2 after he got a pardon .I am 28m and my sister is 24. I had a hard time working today especially since i work a blue collar job at a entry level company, i am the only one that trains people because everyone else is a complete asshole while someone is learning, like they forget thier first day. I also am diagnosed with level 1 autism since a child (aspergers) cptsd, mdd and anxiety to the point where I had to wear a heart monitor for hypertension,  they found out my blood pressure is normal when i am not at work or when i was not attending collage supporting myself. adhd is a recent diagnoses hyperactive and innatentive type i have been medicated for adhd for 6 month even though I did not want to take medication for this since i am on sertraline for depression and anxiety. The adhd medication has changed my life. Its hard to work I need the money  because I  had a alchohol and cocaine problem with my ex girlfriend from 19-25 years old took out some loans for us i got fucked i have been sober other than eating weed edibles 30 mg a night  and broke up with her, she died 2 weeks later from a overdose and i carry this with me. This weekend I started drinking again because of what my sister did and I am drunk now, i just dont feel ok. I am planning to quit since i only have 3 beers left right now and I need to man up right now and not be a bitch. I went off topic with context but I sent my father to jail after my first place burnt down and came back home. My father never worked and my mother worked full time,  mostly in fast food. Anyway way I sent my father to jail because he tried to suffocate my mother either a pillow and I heard it, I got charged at first because I fought him, I kicked down the door screaming  hurt someone your own size i fucking dare you fucking hit me please (punching myself in the face)! Dont touch my fucking mother fuck you after his streak of being non abusive and it was forgiven and he still thinks he is innocent and that I was brainwashed, well he went to jail and my charges were dropped after 9 court dates since he called the cops on me. After he did this  my mother told me he broke my ribs at 1 or 2 years old and they said I squirmed and fell out of his arms and that she was so heartbroken on how everytime I breathed she would hear them cracking that he knew he did it ( i have back pain every day from this and do a pysical job). I got mad and she said  hey I've gotten beat for you don't say I've done nothing I started screaming at her blaming her for everything even though we were very close growing up, well I went homeless getting locked outside at- 20c with a thin Hoodie and her saying in tears that I am just like my father. I was a good fucking kid, I never laid a finger and used manners and tried to do anything so make someone smile and to be considerate.  I learned how not to cry because I would get beat more for it. It's been hard i cannot stop crying and i do not know how to show my emotions properly, i wont lash out on someone just because i feel bad but i hurt alot right now. I have a clean record for mental and criminal records other than a suicide attempt 11 years ago. My sister and father both her very dialated pupils, they go black. I have brown eyes and they both have blue but thier eyes go black. I don't get this. I want to get my nuts snipped because I don't want anyone to feel like this. It hurts alot. I have always wanted to be a good man. Ever since my ex I've stayed single and I have not had sex. I am talking to a therapist and if you met me you would think I was a very nice guy I just don't know what brain structure problem they have , what they actually have and I don't even feel like I should stay alive at this point because how can I trust myself through such evil? I've never done anything like this and my pupils don't get black or dilated but is there some gene I can test for this? If I can I want to help my niece to not get into foster care I am doubting reproducing because I am so scared of what I could be carrying. I wish I was a psychopath and I wish I could have a family. It hurts so much and like I did this weekend I am so ashamed I drank so much beer because I feel so un content thinking about this yet I cannot stop. I wish I had no empathy or guilt. Unfortunately I am still damaged and getting old. I wish I had no guilt because I feel so bad. Sometimes I remember her laugh and it breaks my heart that the one time I tore her down. It's hard to cope and I have bled on one co worker and it's embarrassing.  I feel so bad right now. Sorry this is disorganized I am drunk. Idk if I can live if I know I can become like this?

1c5buav;Wasting my life n potential;im_raemo;"Every time I feel motivated, I say that this time I am focused and disciplined, I will do everything to get a good grade on the BAC, and I won't give up. I tell myself this every time, I've repeated it 6 or 7 times, it's starting to get annoying. I don't feel like doing it anymore because I know I'm lying to myself. It's either I say it and do it, or I do nothing. I think my speech has lost credibility. There's no point in saying it's a war and that I won't give up, that I'll show everyone what I'm really worth, and then do nothing after and make excuses to take week-long breaks or get to a point where I completely abandon my dreams and say I'm worthless and ruined everything. But deep down, I want to cry, and I know I can do it, but I just can't. I keep finding excuses to watch reels, scroll through Insta, or even watch anime. It's destroying me. I'm not consistent in my studies, and every passing day, I know I'm wasting my potential and my path, all the effort I've put in to get here, just to ruin it all for a few reels or chatting with certain losers.I KNOW I CAN DO IT, but even though I keep repeating it constantly in my head, it has lost credibility. Every time I feel like I'm lying to myself, and I know I won't do it; I'll probably give in to the pressure and my weak morale. I don't have a strong mindset like David Goggins; I give in every time. This last time was for Eid, the problem is I couldn't even be consistent in prayer. Anyway, I messed up everything: my studies, my life, my future. The problem is, I know what I should do, but I don't do it. When I was under my parents' responsibility, I had a bright future already laid out for me. But during my high school years, I made the terrible mistake of neglecting what they were doing for me. Now I realize that when they took care of everything, I made no mistakes. I could have become that almost perfect version of myself, the one I always wanted to be: cultured, speaking many languages, respectful to all, successful in my studies, with a bright future ahead, relentlessly pursuing my dreams. I had everything: a future, a healthy relationship with my parents and loved ones, a healthy body, a healthy mind. I was already speaking 3 languages, I was special among all the people I knew, I was already the model student. And I lost it all because of a teenage rebellion.What did I gain from it? Nothing at all. I started hanging out with a group of losers who influenced me. I lifted them up but also kept dragging myself down, doing skateboarding, basketball, playing video games – things I never wanted to do. I just wanted to fit in. By rebelling against my parents, I just wanted someone to help me and pull me out of this miserable life where I always plunged into despair. I wanted someone to save me from my depression and all the illnesses that came with it, someone to make me realize what I'm writing right now and tell me that everything would be fine. I was on the brink of self-harm, on the brink of suicide. But where would that lead me? Is my life so insignificant and worthless? Is that all I'm worth? I hate this version of myself, but what happened to me? WHY?! That's the question I ask myself every day. Why did I become like this? From the student with the most promising future to the average guy who's worth nothing. I don't want to continue living like this. I don't want to lead my life like this. If I continue living like this, what's the point? Death is better. I want to be special, make a change, leave a mark. I DON'T WANT TO BE NORMAL. But I always give in to pressure.

1c5bql8;Please read, stay alive. ;Clover__4;I, as well as many others have struggled immensely with suicidal thoughts. I want to tell you all the stereotypical phrases because they’re all true, but I’m sure you’ve heard them a million times. What I am telling you is that yesterday my best friend tried to kill herself. She is thankfully ok and currently hospitalized but has no phone contact so I can’t speak to her. I can’t explain how I felt when I found out, I don’t know how but when I woke up that morning I knew something was wrong. I texted her throughout the day with no response until in my last class at school I texted her mom asking if she was ok. As I was walking home I got a vague reply that she was safe but in a place where she couldn’t have her phone and that she was sleeping, I instantly knew something was wrong and dropped to the floor crying. I called my mom and broke down. My gut feeling was proven correct an hour or so later when my friend woke up and told me through her mom what happened. I’ve been a mess all day, I know the feelings you have to have to do something like that and I feel awful I couldn’t have stopped it. it’s been hours and I still can’t think of anything but her. Thank god she’s ok, but she could have not been. This isn’t a sob story, this is to tell you someone out there really does love you. And this is how they’d react.

My hands feel shakey, fingers feel fuzzy, I want to cry all the time, my chest feels sick and tight, I feel like I can't breath properly. Last night I just cried and hyperventilated. And all becsuse i feel like my life is wasted. I dont have any friends, I only have my partner. Ive been thinking a lot these past few days and due to have zero friends it's making me miss out a lot on life. I don't have anyone to call, text, catch up with, celebrate birthdays or life events with, I'll never have and never attend a bachelor/ bachelorette parties, i wont have a typical nice weddings filled with people i love (because i dont have any), I'll never be a bridesmaid, I won't have anyone at my funeral, I'll be an old lady that dies and no one know what to do with cos she doesnt have any family or friends. I'll never do normal typical things or hit normal milestones. I cant act normal, I can't speak to people normally, I cant function normally. It's really sad to see everyone else do these things and realise that I'll never have that. Im reducing my social media time because its painful to see people out having fun with friends and how life could be and the experiences I'm missing out on. It makes me really upset and hurt that I'll miss out on these things. I don't see the point in my absolute waste of a life. If I wasn't here today, no one and nothing would be impacted. I've wasted my life trying to survive and now I'm paying the consequences as a lonely, sad, depressed, mentally ill person in my 30s. I absolutely fucking hate the people who treated me life shit as a child because its their fucking fault i can't function as a normal member of society. It's their fault I have to deal with being a mental fuck up and cant regulate my emotions, it's their fault I cant connected with people and let them in. It's their fault I panic in notmal scenarios. What I would give to wake up tomorrow and feel loved by people and act normal. Also I don't know if im sad and depressed as to why I'm feeling so panicked/ anxious about this. Because in reality, do I even want those things? Or does my mental health stop me from wanting these things. Is it something I want or something I think I want because everyone else has it. Without my issues, would I want these ""normal"" events? Without my mental health would my life be different or am i just sad, lonely and craving love?

1c5bj6r;What do you think about my situation;Constant_War9895;I stopped my meds last week. Cold turkey had a bad time and now I’m okay. Finally off lamictal and still taking Zoloft only 50mg. I did this last time nothing happened but this time cold turkey was so scary. Anyways I’m depressed I have adhd and anxiety. Oh and I guess a mood disorder. I’ve been anxious since I can remember. At 36 had my son with my high school sweetheart. Married in 2020. Bought our home, we both live remote and have good jobs. Raising our little guy. I have it all really. But after 2021 my mental health has gone down hill. Postpartum hit hard, I found out my brother who is 2 years younger than me sexually abused my niece. Mom and dad stood with him. I stood with my sister but it’s always just felt like this hit me so hard like she still kept contact with the them. I cut everyone off. My mom and I used to be so close. We are getting better. My dad won’t leave me alone. He wants me in his life but this has triggered flash backs and I think I was abused as a kid. Honestly idk I always blacked it out but now it’s starting to make sense. I woke up from my bunkbed eyes just adjusting when I realized my underwear around my ankles. I turn to quickly see his black Curley hair turn away fast I know I saw his eyes and then it goes blurry. When my Dads dad died my sister told me she had woken up with her underwear off and they were the only ones in the house. She said this to me at the same time we found out what my brother did. It’s kinda feels like a confirmation as to what I think and tried to forget happened. Honestly I don’t even know anymore… I also remember laying underneath my bunk bed eyes closed imagining or dreaming I was on a table and people were touching me?? This was when I was little I always have had those flashbacks in the back of my head but I always assumed it must have not been real maybe I dreamt it? I must have been like 5 or 6? Not sure but since my sister told me what she experienced I can’t help but think something happened. My dad has always been weirdly attached to me more than allll his kids. If always hear about how my dad went crazy over me when I was born. He didn’t love my sister because they had lost their bond when my dad came to the states and my mom stayed back in El Salvador with my sister then came to the states and by that time my sister had forgotten my dad and she only wanted my moms dad. I’m assuming that angered him idk but she was beat by him and I was treated like a princess. I was born here in the USA. Now all these memories are coming together like something not so pleasant since finding out my brother is a pedo and my parents protected him. Even to some point my sister felt bad for him. It’s 2024 now everyone’s kinda moved on seems like, family dynamics have changed but I am here still stuck in grief. I went back on meds just to feel nothingAnd weed became an addiction for me I’ve always been the “responsible” one or whatever feels like I’m a golden child.I hate myselfI always have and it grew when I turned 13. I’ll be 30 in November and for the first time ever I really do feel suicidal. I’m not just emo anymore.I quit my meds and seriously went into withdrawal. I’m better now but with just 50 of Zoloft and I just feel like they never even helped and alll the hurt I’ve ignored is knocking at my door and each panic attack gets scarier and I become more dissociative. I want to be alive for my son but now death just seems so inviting, the guild of what that would do to him is the only thing keeping me grounded. I really don’t want to be on meds.

1c5bfw2;Mental health and concerns for my future;Ratinyourwall;I have struggled with Depression, Anxiety, and ADHD for about 7 years. All of which have made life very difficult for me. I’m embarrassed to say this but it prevents me from doing many normal daily tasks. I brush my teeth once every few days, only shower once every 1-2 weeks, cannot cook food for myself, if food is cooked for me I often don’t even have the energy to eat it, when I need to go to the toilet I will sit for hours until I actually go, leaving me incredibly uncomfortable, I don’t go out and socialise with friends, at times I can’t even dress myself and my boyfriend has to help me, and I am very tired and negative all the time. I suffer with SH and due to my eating habits I am underweight. I will admit that I have thought about suicide on and off for many years, making detailed plans on a number of occassions, although my uncle killed himself and the guilt of making my dad go through that again is too much. I am also afraid that it wouldn’t work and people were disappointed in me or I ended up physically disabled. I’m being open in the hopes that it will help other people not feel so misunderstood and alone, and so that others in my situation can use this post to help themselves.I have switched around medications, all of which seem to provide minimal help, I’ve had therapy (of different sorts) and been to A&E when things have gotten too bad. I am 17, in the UK,  and dropped out of college during my second year. Originally I planned to go back, to retry the next year, but as the time is getting closer I am realising that I don’t think I will be capable of it. I want to be able to make my own income and be independent, but as of right now being in college just won’t work for me. People have said that I should believe in myself, but in school, and college, I did this and it has never worked out for me. I know myself better than anyone else does, and if I’m being realistic I know that it just isn’t for me. I live alone with my mum, and she will be supportive of any decisions I make. As of right now I need advice or possible options for me in the future.Maybe jobs, ways I can work my way through life, ways of income, education etc. Any advice would be brilliant as I am at a loss right now. I feel like there are no routes I can go down, and my future is feeling very nonexistent. I find that I am very bad with repitition, if I do something the same time every month it begins to become very difficult and I cannot gather motivation to do it. Though I feel like almost all jobs will be repetitive.

1c5az6r;being high doesn’t fix the thoughts anymore ;Ok_Cartographer_4310;i (17f) have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I grew up in an incredibly abusive household and I was born with drugs in my system (coke, alc, cigarettes, and smth else, but clearly i got issues because of it) and I have a lot of mental health issues because of those two factors. My anxiety, PTSD, and depression are probably my biggest struggles. I don’t sleep because sleeping means tomorrow is coming sooner rather than later. And so I stay up for days to delay it. I only leave to work and I have to force myself to get up to pee. All I ever do right now is lay in bed, get high, and use my phone to distract myself. I tend to watch movies or tv shows or tiktok because even reading is too much. At first, the weed helped I think. To be fair, I was only ever getting high with my friend at first. But now that I’m alone and in a bad despressive state, it feels like the weed makes it 10x worse. I struggle with PTSD (I haven’t been formally diagnosed with this but it makes the most sense.) and I get bad flashbacks from a lot of things I try so hard to forget. Sometimes I’ll smell the room and feel like I’m in it or I’ll remember the feelings and pain and I’ll have panic attacks or get really uncomfortable. And being high makes it worse. I usually can’t cry about my own issues and pain and I watch sad things to cope. But when I’m high it’s like all the thoughts I want to forget come rushing and I can’t hold it in. And all my other symptoms feel 10x worse. But I also use weed to cope with my home life because it feels better than being sober, and it feels like I can’t win. I also get less anxiety when high, so I feel like I can be my normal self around people. This was more of a vent than anything else.;i (17f) have been depressed for as long as I can remember.

I managed to subdue it by sittint down though. For the past two days i have constantly had this feeling like right before you start crying and the throat begins to cramp.

1c5aegf;This is helping me, maybe this will help you too;A-gmz;"I have been struggling hard lately, I felt like I needed therapy for quite a while now but could not afford it ....finally I felt I hit a very very low point (wont get into details) and did not know that to do and how to deal with anything, buy i knew speaking to someone woud help and so i saved what i could and sacrificed some stuff and bills to get me some kind of therapy, local therapy is very hard to get where i live or very very expensive, so I stumbled upon an app that was promoted on a podcast that matches you with a therapist (or whomever is fittest for your situation) and can chat, call or video and allows to comunícate with someone constantly. and for the last month things have been progressing for me, I feel like I'm on the right track for the first time in a couple of years. Although it's a bit expensive for me (even with the app ""financial aid"") I hope I can continue in this path of therapy and getting better.If you feel like you need help, reach out to someone that knows hot to help, things will get better. I dont know what I'll do next month for the payment but if therapy is what you are looking for, the app is BetterHelp and this link might help you out. I believe it's 2 weeks off for new people https://www.betterhelp.com/rpc/a7815d7f0071b9c9-5-11?utm_term=ref_v2_ddAnd it's a plus for me also, not misleading anyone but if  someone uses that link, it will  help me to continue getting therapy, actually affording next month or two and better myself.

1c5ac7t;Is it possible to fall out of love in a span of mere 3-5 days. ;Vegetable_Glass8200;My boyfriend has not been well recently, he got extremely sick and weak. So we naturally weren't able to talk much as we are also in ldr (long distance relationship) and also because he needed rest or he was busy. We usually also were not able to talk much because of our parents or because we were usually busy. So we used to vc and do our work so that we could be together with eachother. But recently, as he got unwell he started to ignore me. It was just for a day or two that he then asked me for distance as he isn't able to do anything and being in a relationship made him feel uncomfortable. It was just two days in of him being sick and some other things happened too. Then ofc i wasn't okay with it as I love him more than anything. It's like that he filled up the hollowness in me with his love and suddenly left me empty. We both know that space or break don't end well so I asked him if he wants to end it. He at last meant yes he wanted to break up. This has hurt me so much, it has affected me so much that i really feel like ending everything because I have no one except him, literally no one. He promised me the world and then the next day left me alone and desparate.This post is not about my mental health. I really wanna know that why would he just say that he doesn't love me in a mere span of 5 days when he loved me more than anything before those days. I really want to know that do men do this when they feel emotionally unavailable for themselves. Is he neglecting his feelings for everything including his love for me?

1c5a8iv;Still a monster wuthout my meds?;Kat_Hglt;"I don't know where to even begin...  I was always a very nervous, irritated child, I used to throw a lot of tantrums when overstimulated, which I very easily was. Teenage years were hell as well, I was so nervous all the time, had no social cues, stressed a lot about EVERYTHING. I destroyed my room several times due to not being able to regulate my emotions, I was insulting towards my parents, I was depressed, had no friends. We thought it was depression. I tried several meds, it didn't help. Then, at 18, I tried escitalopram. It got better. It was not immediately perfect, but it got waaaaay more manageable. I was more relaxed, happier, I even became more agreeable to be around.I'm now 29, and for the last 11 years, it kept improving. I have a stable job, a stable boyfriend, we rent a quite small yet relatively cosy apartment. I have few but good friends and I have a good relationship with my family. I discovered I can actually be a joyful, easy going and fun person. Life is good.Now, my ""problem"" is: my psychiatrist told me when I started to take escitalopram that I might need to take it for my whole life. At the time, I didn't really care, because my life was HELL, so I thought ""whatever it takes"". But now, I'm starting to question myself. I tried to decrease the dosage (with my psychiatrist's approval, of course), but I can't seem to function under 10mg.And now I'm starting doubting myself: I thought I had progressed so much in life, I had learned how to manage my anxiety and my emotions better, in short, I thought I had finally become a BETTER PERSON, A GOOD PERSON, which I never thought I was before. But as soon as the dosage drops below 10mg, I become a literal monster. I become aggressive again, a nervous wreck, I want to cry and sleep all day, I snap at people for the pettiest reason ever. And I KNOW my psychiatrist told me I might need to take the medication for ever, but I can't help thinking I'm actually not the joyful, easy going and fun person I thought I had become. I have actually made no progress AT ALL. It's the medication that does that. I'm actually still bad. And that thought breaks me...";I don't know where to even begin...

Most of my life hasn’t been easy. I’m not complaining that it was terrible but it wasn’t great. I’ve experienced a lot of things like SA, abusive relationships, rpe, neglect, having an emotionally unavailable toxic parent…as the list goes on. I had started self harming myself at 12 because I was bullied at school and mentally abused at home. I had no safe space. Fast forward a bit things got worse. At 15 I couldn’t feel anything emotionally. I stopped smiling, laughing and all my other emotions till I was 22. It’s almost as if the whole world lost color. When I turned 22 I healed and smiled for the first time in a long time. I’m still smiling and feeling everything now but this issue is sometimes I’ll have my “dark thoughts” again. What I mean by “dark thoughts” is things like ending myself or I feel like I don’t want to be here anymore. It’s like a rollercoaster.

1c59odt;If I'm not inherently an unlikeable and bad person, why was/am I hated so much?;AshesInTheDust;"Now that I'm older, when I open up to people about wanting to kill myself or feeling that I deserve to die they tell me that I shouldn't. Reasonable I suppose. But they also tell me that they actually enjoy my presence. That they aren't around just because I'm convenient or better than nothing. That they miss me when I'm not around. Less reasonable. I can't believe what they say is true. I think they're lying out of guilt, they just want to feel important, they don't want to feel responsible for any harm I'd do to myself, or that they're just being polite.  Ik it's because I've internalized that I'm an inherently terrible person. It's why, even if I'm not actively suicidal, I still believe that I deserve to die. This isn't paranoia or me projecting self hatred either. My entire childhood was just full of insults, osterization, neglect, or indifference at best.  Originally I was going to include examples but I've decided against it, feel free to ask trauma dumping is a hobby of mine at this point.  I understand that a child realistically can't be deserving of that. I understand that even if I somehow did I am not responsible for it. I think I've been punished enough for any potential sin at this point. I understand that I've literally never done anything to warrant this treatment. I think the worse thing I've ever done was maybe being a rude? I used to steal classmates pencils too. I also flipped off a friend behind their back when I was in the 3rd grade for some reason. I still don't know why I did that actually. What I'm saying is that realistically I don't deserve a shitton of hatred.  But I can't believe that my life is worth living. I can't believe that I'm anything other than a useless failure who will inevitably hurt everyone around me by being around them. I can't believe I'm anything other than an annoying insufferable peice of shit that should have never been born. I can't believe that. I just can't.  Because if I am a somewhat decent human being. Hell, if I could be considered a human being at all, then why did people treat me like that? So many people, for so long, if I didn't do anything to deserve it why the hell did that happen? Why, in the case of my parents, is it still happening? If I don't deserve this how I am supposed to be able to remotely deal with that? Frankly, it's easier to just accept it and kill myself. ""I'm a horrible person who deserves to die, so I will die"". It's easier.   Also, if the nice things people say is true, where the fuck where these people? How did I not meet a single kind person for the first 18 years of my life. I had friends, but they always purposely hurt me at the end. Fuck I had one literally tell me that they always hated me, but they needed someone to take the majority of the bullying. That's not really an uncommon occurrence for me. I never had a single teacher, stranger, friend, or family member actually help me, listen to me, do anything. It can't be bad luck I refuse to believe it was bad luck it has to be something I was and maybe still am doing I have to be the problem here. It would make sense if I am just a bad person, because then it would be that I didn't deserve their kindness. That makes more sense, that's so much more realistic than bad luck.  So why the hell, with everything in mind, how or why or I don't know if I should live why was I hated so much? If I genuinely didn't deserve it, if I currently don't deserve it, then why was or is it happening?";Now that I'm older, when I open up to people about wanting to kill myself or feeling that I deserve ;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-16 06:58:15;2024-04-16;Tuesday;06:58:15;3476;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:53.404547

When I compare myself to my friends and all the fun things they are posting about on SM and telling me what they are doing, I feel so boring and dull.I feel like all I do is work, run errands and lay around, and maybe see a friend once a week.One of my friends in particular just moved to the city I’m in, and I find myself often feeling jealous of her because she’s posting how she’s doing like three things a day, and partying often etc.But when I think about that, I did that stuff more often when I was first in the city, and if I was invited to all those things I probably wouldn’t want to go. In fact when I think about being my happiest it’s when I’m doing craft or getting a nice coffee with a friend, or travelling. Not doing lots of group things.So maybe I’m just more introverted than other people and that’s okay? Or maybe my work means more to me than others and that’s okay?

My older brother committed suicide in February and i haven't stopped thinking about him since then. I wish I was closer. He sent a message a month prior and I hadn't seen it until a couple weeks ago.

I want it back because it's the only momento I'd have. I miss him so much. Last time I saw him was on a cruise in August. He got married then his wife left him for another man and he lost his job and with his history of abuse from my mom, that just pushed him. I wish I could've saved him.

1c594ok;I hate my father.;Sudden-Wait5174;"I've spoken about this before, but I just need somewhere to put out how I truly feel thats not my head. I hate my father. For a long time I've hated him. I still can't wrap my head around how my mom still loves him. Maybe because theyve known eachother for their whole lives. But other than that, theres nothing to love about him.These past few years I've been going crazy. I cant talk about my suffering with verbal abuse to anyone. They always say things like ""it's not abuse, my parents yelled at me all the time and i'm fine!"" or ""sometimes parents just lose their cool."" No one ever believes me, or wants to. My mother always has told me to forgive him, that he didn't mean it and acts out that way because of his sickness. In all honesty, I couldn't give less of a shit about that. For as long as I can remember I've begged and prayed for his illness to win over him. He stopped his treatments a while ago cause he's a huge baby and didn't wanna see the doctor, I honestly have no idea how he's still alive. I know he'll pass eventually, and I think about that day everyday. I see no downsides to his death. I'll get to roam my house freely, spend his retirement money, have a chance to finally heal from the trauma he's caused me and so much more. I know this is horrible for me to say and think, I know I am not any better for it. My only explanation is I just don't agree that abusers should live. Someone who physically abused my little brother definetly shouldn't. I hate him more everyday. He's nothing but a slump of shit that rots on a couch eating all our food and taking up space and air. He is nothing but an inconvenience and I honestly don't know why he hasn't taken himself out yet. He's already failed this life, why can't he just move onto the next?The only con I see in him dying is my mom being heartbroken over it. I don't want to see her like that and I don't want her to feel that way, especially since we already lost someone recently to the same illness. It's not like I understand why she would be, but I'll still feel horrible when it happens. I'll feel guilty myself, for telling her so many times over the years how much I couldn't wait for that day. Maybe we'll use his money for her therapy.I'm not proud of the way I think. I'm not proud of any of this. I guess I just never got a chance to let out my frustration (since no one ever took me seriously or listened), and now I've been like this for 3 years. I hope I get better one day, preferably soon.";I've spoken about this before, but I just need somewhere to put out how I truly feel thats not my he;Venting;3;8;2024-04-16 06:22:44;2024-04-16;Tuesday;06:22:44;2487;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:54.442821

1c58q51;I get overly sentimental and sad when a vacation ends, especially any time I go to Alaska. ;DoggoTamer27;I travel quite a bit, mainly to see family and overall be closer together, but even when I’m not, even when I’m simply just going on a vacation, big or small, roadtrip to a neighboring state or flying across a whole continent, I always get incredibly depressed, sad, and have extreme FOMO of everything around me. Recently I am getting done with a two week trip from Alaska. It has been great to see all of my friends and family, and I will be coming up in another month anyway (this however for work purposes, I work commercial fishing in the summer). Which makes me wonder why I’m so sad. I can’t do anything without feeling the anxiety of missing out on something. I get almost scared and anxious when I’m in a room without windows. I need to constantly see outside because I feel like I will miss something, or I at least want to “see the sights for the last time” even though I’m not leaving until tomorrow afternoon. I’ll be absolutely miserable and depressed at the fact that I’m leaving and have to verbally talk to myself on why it’s not a bad thing and how everything will work out fine and be ok and that I’ll be back in a month anyway. I’ll find myself staring out a window just at the scenery, not even good scenery literally just a back alley away as I’m staying with a friend in Anchorage for a few nights before I fully leave. But for some reason I still can’t pull myself away from the window, and I still just keep wanting to see the sky, see everything and say “farewell” if you will I guess. But even when I walk away and go somewhere throughout the house I get incredibly anxious. I find myself constantly looking at friends snap map locations in my home town (not in a weird way and only certain friends, the ones in particular I’ve known for over 13 years) because I simply have such bad FOMO and still want to be with them and I feel like checking snap map and keeping in contact is a way I can still somewhat be there. I’ve broken down multiple times even since leaving my home town and traveling to Anchorage. Thinking about just how much my friends and even their own families have told me how much they care for me, for some reason makes me incredibly emotional and I feel the opposite of what I should feel, I just feel sad, and cry, especially after one of my buddies moms sent me a text about how much I meant to her and their family, and that she viewed me as a second son. I don’t get why I’m feeling so sad about leaving, I get this way with any trip I take, but even in the past of leaving Alaska, and saying goodbye sometimes for even much longer periods of time, it has never felt this bad and saddening.;I travel quite a bit, mainly to see family and overall be closer together, but even when I’m not, ev;Venting;1;2;2024-04-16 05:56:37;2024-04-16;Tuesday;05:56:37;2641;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-19 13:30:54.447628

I still regret it to this day. I’m trans mtf as I’ve wanted to be a girl since I was extremely little but when my parents found out they forbid me from exploring it or even talking about it, so I’m long past the time where some things have become irreversible so I’m trapped like this now.

Over time, I fell into a really deep depression, with no help. I often find myself filled with anger, usually when something goes wrong, or something doesn't go the way I wanted it to. As of very recently I've resorted to punching a wall, or myself, which is something I really don't want to turn into a habit. I also scream into a pillow occasionally. A therapist I saw a while ago said it could help release anger, it doesn't, it just distracts me. Therapy as a whole hasn't helped me at all, I don't know if it was me or the therapists I went to. I kind of feel hopeless right now, I'm filled with all these emotions and don't know what to do, and I have no one I trust enough to share this with. I've tried breathing exercises, screaming into a pillow, 1-2 types of meditation, and it doesn't help. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to try and fix this?

1c5831x;I don’t even know what’s wrong with me anymore ;Latter-Blacksmith652;I used to have what was very obviously depression and anxiety. Went on sertraline and bupropion for about 6 months and have been tapering for the past month (per my doctor’s instructions). I decided to taper because even after adjustments to my dosage and the addition of bupropion i was so numb. Also, the tinnitus was really bad. My school performance was suffering I think because i didn’t have the anxiety that would normally drive me to get stuff done. It’s been a week of being completely off my medication and I’m able to cry again (which is a good thing for me) but I don’t feel any better otherwise. The brain zaps are terrible first of all- they’re making me feel super out of it. Secondly (and this is probably my biggest issue), I can’t get myself to go to class/get caught up on school work. I’ve only gone to a few classes in the last month and a half and I’m really digging myself into a hole. The problem is.. I just don’t care? I feel nothing about the F I have in every class. Intellectually I know I need to just suck it up and go but it’s like there’s an even more powerful force in my brain trying to sabotage me. Idk if that makes sense.

1c57bmk;Part of me doesn't want help.;scaredycat07;I'm (26F) fairly certain that I have mental health issues, and am worried that it's a lot. It's affecting my life. My emotions are all over the place and mostly negative, I have no friends, I'm not able to trust anyone, I don't have much motivation to do anything, and it always feels like something bad is about to happen. I've been this way for years now.Despite knowing that I probably need help, part of me doesn't want help. I realized this when I tried taking an SSRI (due to sleep issues, my doctor said I have anxiety.).Since I was about a pre-teen, I noticed that I can experience intense emotions when engaging in certain types of media and darker themes. I find these pieces of media to be validating, cathartic, and a way for me to explore things in a safe way. But, when I took the SSRI, these feelings completely disappeared, and I couldn't enjoy those things anymore. My darker thoughts disappeared too. It felt like I lost myself, and I was super uncomfortable with it. I hated it.I'm no longer taking the meds (due to other side effects), and the feelings and thoughts returned.I'm just afraid that if I seek help, I won't be able to enjoy those things anymore, and that I'll lose my sense of self. I know it sounds silly, but, it's really stopping me from seeking help. Does anyone else feel this way?

Throughout my teenage years I dated guys that were already out of high school. It wasn’t until I turned 18 I had realized I’ve been groomed. There was a SA at one point by a guy I only hung out with once. Lots of being cheated on. Lots of physical contact during fights. I was only a teenager. In high school. This has made my self image and self worth almost nonexistent now. I was with an amazing guy after high school. He did everything right. He never made me feel alone or angry. I messed that up big time. In hindsight I was lost. I am now with a guy that makes me feel lonely. He drives my self worth into the ground. He looks at other girls online. Like he’s not satisfied with what he has with me. It seems like a pattern in all my relationships. I’ve talked to him twice about it. I just can’t bring myself to leave. I’ve thought about therapy but I’m not sure how much it’ll help me as I’ve tried once before. I fear that I’m sinking into a hole too deep to pull myself out of. I only have so much left in me. I’m not close with my mom. I have no friends. I work a construction job. No real hobbies. I can’t escape the roller coaster that is my mind 24/7. I’m writing this now as I can’t sleep because of overthinking and anxiety and finding things on my bfs page that I didn’t want to see. He gaslights me. He must think I’m stupid.

So I finally made the call to see a psychiatrist M.D. to get my meds adjusted and find out why all of a sudden, my depression is becoming more and more, difficult to manage. I have days where I’m fine but today I was looking forward to grocery shopping and as soon as I walked into the grocery store, a cloud overcame me and all I wanted to do was to run out of that store, but my cart was full of food and I could not leave it there and all of my plans for what I was going to make for dinner and eat the entire week just did not appeal to me and I just wanted to get the hell out of that store. I don’t understand. I love grocery shopping, but I just quickly went to the checkout got what I had and left. I just don’t understand my brain.

They play like split second movies in my head like as if someone were scrolling through the internet and pulling one up to show me. Normally my intrusive thoughts are disturbing or make me feel violated. I have pure obsessional ocd which has been mild and not a huge problem for several years. But the intrusive thoughts seem to change their theme to extremely disturbingly sad images when I'm dealing with depression. Recently I had a horrible intrusive mental image that came up about three days ago and it keeps randomly popping up, (it also has sound to it, it is exactly like a small waking dream or split second movie), and it has been making me genuinely distraught and caused me to break down crying multiple times. It's been like mental torture dealing with this. Basically I keep seeing this awful mental image of one of my family members wracked with gut wrenching sobs. :(....what the fuck is this?

I am not really sure if this is the best subreddit to put it in.Something that has been bothering me for a while is how little I trust my memory. About everything, basically. I often get the sense that I am lying when I tell people my name, my age, or other personal information. Or that I am filling out the wrong address on forms, or telling a story that never happened. I always tell myself to just push through it but I don't really have any way to prove it. I feel very guilty about it sometimes, because I need to check multiple time to make sure I am talking to the right person or that I remember who my girlfriend is or things like that, even if there really isn't a reason for me to question it in the first place. It's just always there.I have gone to therapy before but not much happened. I struggle to be honest with my therapist and I feel like I am not telling the truth when I go, so I have not had any helpful advice from them and I stopped.

For example, I saw someone had large pictures of their wedding in their living room and I was like “gross, who needs to be THAT focused on their love.” I also feel disgust when I see stuff about Mothers being extra loving towards their kids. In general, it just grosses me out and I don’t get why people need to have such strong displays of love/emotion. I don’t really have any pictures of any of my family/friends in my house except for a few on the fridge and 1 canvas of my brother who died. I do not think of putting up pictures of loved ones or anything about my relationship in my decor. It feels obsessive/weak/lame to me.

It makes me feel bad and I worry about hurting the kid (I’ve never said anything negative to her or the family, I try to mask as good as possible). It makes me feel like a monster but I just don’t see why I have to be an auntie to my partner’s niece? Or why I really need to be connected to his family at all.

I come to you in hope for an answer or tools to help me heal the wounds associated with traveling.In the past 4 years I have greatly struggled to find the desire to travel anywhere. Be it work, college, grocery shopping, and recreational activities, I struggle hard to find the motivation to leave the house anymore.In the past 4 years, I endured many crushing blows to my sense of safety and trust. As we have endured, Covid was an extremely difficult time for me to deal with everything it entailed. I felt my world crumble beneath me and feared for my life on a daily basis.In 2021, I watched my Grandma endure a slow, painful, and just plain agonizing death from renal and congestive heart failure. Her passing came after two long years, in April 2023.I watched my Mom have to endure the brunt of this as I tried to mitigate trying to find a job, bring in severe debt, and being at rock bottom emotionally. We both had to watch as my Dad chose to abandon us emotionally and fiscally as we tried to take care of Grandma in the nursing home. In March 2020, I broke up with my first serious girlfriend after six months together, about two weeks before the lockdowns in Ohio. This relationship I can honestly say I didn’t want to end but felt pressured to do so from fatigue after several poorly executed intimate moments between New years and Valentine’s Day that year. They were non-sexual, just poorly handled on my part. In turn the shame caused me to feel it was necessary to break up with her. I have tried to contact her twice to apologize and see if some kind of a relationship could be salvaged, and have been met with vicious retort as she held nothing but anger towards me.In 2022 I was kicked out for a band I was playing bass in after 6 months due to an argument between the lead singer, lead guitarist and I. The argument was about a parking spot, but it was so much more for me. It was the lack of consideration, the passive aggressive insults, and the overall peon treatment that I had endured.With all this on my conscious, how can I feel the desire to interact with the world again?What tools are there that I can use to feel the desire to talk to women again?Even the effort of driving to work puts panic in me.

In a moment of desperation, I even reached out to his mom (who doesn't even know me), which I regret. We tried to reconcile, but he expressed that he found me too needy and co-dependent, and ultimately, he ended things, citing his own personal issues and the need for space. I was deeply invested in this relationship, especially since I lost my virginity to him. This was all in a span of one month, and I truly liked him and wanted to be with him for the long term. I'm strongly mourning what could've been. I feel like this is all my fault.   I just want to call him and text him to work things out, but I know it would do more harm than good if I did that right now.

1c541sg;Can someone help me explain what's going on?;Responsible-Buy7550;"Hello all!I (male) have a complicated relationship with my mother. She had me when she was 15 years old, getting pregnant by my seemingly antisocial father from what I gather.Despite the trauma, and I imagine an internal conflict about how she really felt about having me, she does some really strange things in my opinion...Firstly, it's how she's been treating me since I was little - (threaten to) abandoning me at the slightest hint of any flaw I might have as a human - whether physically or emotionally.Secondly, she often mirrors how I feel about things and she makes it seem like it's how she feels about things, but I can tell it's not what she really feels about it. Hard to explain, but an example - if I feel helpless, she feels helpless - and that's not just for the moment, which I would more easily understand - mirroring - but it might be to how I feel in life in general...Then, I feel personally responsible to comfort her, and I'm beginning to question if this is all an act on her part. And if so, I don't know if it's conscious or not.She does mirror people in general and is deeply insecure about herself as well as rejecting it as a whole. But this ""life-mirroring"" and discard is something she does specifically towards me...I'm not looking to diagnose her, but some pointing out how I should understand it all, would probably be of good help. Any advice would also be appreciated, but try to keep in mind that I'm getting old and don't have that many relationships in my life.

1c53vdv;Looking for hope;cantthinkofone47;Hi. This is my first post here. I, 28F, have been given a long list of diagnoses over the last 20 years. I struggled severely with anxiety from the time I was a toddler. From there, I went through countless emotional traumas as well as physical/medical traumas of all kinds from the ages of 5-22, many with permanent impacts for the rest of my life. I have been seeing psychiatrists and psychotherapists for over 10 years, and I’ve tried damn near everything. Went through all the SSRI’s , moved on to SNRI’s which are no longer responding. Spent years on heavy doses of klonopin which helped the anxiety, panic attacks, constant rumination, etc however I became highly dependent and didn’t want to remain on benzos long term. I did okay after coming off of them, but a few years ago things started getting worse and worse for me. My symptoms are debilitating. Crying spells, panic attacks, thoughts of death, wishing I didn’t exist. I’m so insanely sensitive to anything people say or do near me or towards me. I find the worst in every scenario. This last year, I overhauled my mental health team for better (and more expensive) treatment, including a total overhead of all medications and a third  orthopedic surgery to help with physical pain. I had to go back to the surgeon today, and it looks like I’ll be needing a fourth with no end in sight, all because some idiot hit me with their car. And some days I do feel like I’m making improvements, until one small comment someone may make or some difficult news at a doctor appointment and I completely regress. I feel hopeless. I used to be a straight A student, an athlete, a friend, a family member, and I feel like all I am not is a shell of a person. I can barely keep my work from home job. I’ve tried and fought and pushed and I feel like my misery will never end. I’m losing the drive to keep trying. What the hell can I do to help myself over come this? Will I be this way forever?;Hi.

1c5398x;My Old Professor Embarrassed Me;TheGreaterShade;"I, f26, have been struggling to get through community college for a while. I am kinda embarrassed to admit I started in 2016. I was out of high school and had no idea how to tackle college. I was a TERRIBLE student who took way too many classes, couldn't handle the workload, fell in with some terrible people, and developed horrible habits as a result. I frequently skipped classes, couldn't turn anything in on time, was constantly obessing over things that weren't important, and had no organizational or management strategies in place to help me. Ultimately, I ended up burning myself out, plowing my GPA into the ground, losing my financial aid, and spending several years telling myself I was a worthless failure. There were also external factors that didn't help. I worked as hard as I could for several years to save up to go back, and then Covid happened, which delayed things. Then my boss basically moved the heavens and Earth to ensure I wouldn't go back to college.But I clawed my way back, I payed for a few semesters out of pocket, I took a new job to accommodate my schooling, I got in with a wonderful therapist who's helped me get back on track and stay that way. I'm happy to report that I'm doing so much better, but something happened the other day that doesn't sit so well with me.One of my previous professors, the head of the English department no less, stopped me in the hall on my way to class.""I know you from somewhere, I just can't remember where."" She said.I told her how I was in one of her classes in 2016. It was enough to jog her memory. She then said, ""Wow, you've been here forever. Are you gonna graduate?""Normally, I brush this off as her being an old nosy woman and me being sensitive. But I can shake her words because they felt a bullet to chest. It is safe to say that interaction messed up my entire day and has led me to ruminate. It's 2024 now, I've spent a decade trying to reconcile my younger self's mistakes. I have spent so long chasing an associates in arts and sciences, the easiest darn degree in existence as far as everyone around me in concerned, and despite the odds I have fought, and obstacle I've had to overcome, its doesn't feel like enough. Meanwhile, my friends and family have moved on with their lives. Everyone I know around me is miles ahead - getting bachelors, getting better jobs, getting married, buying houses, having children - and here I am unable to figure out how to exist the gate. It leaves me feeling slow, stupid, and stunted. I feel like I will never amount to anything because I am a factory mistake, forever and eternally flawed with no hope of being anything else. So, this one interaction continues to haunt me, and I'm not so certain how to deal with it.";I, f26, have been struggling to get through community college for a while.

1c536ks;I don’t know how to love myself;Particular_Progress8;Today was overall a good day if I really think about it. I got up, brushed my teeth, went to the beach and did some homework. But at the same time it wasn’t. I went to the beach to tan and all I could think was how fat and gross I felt. Fat pig is what came to mind. I remembered when I was 13 carving the word fat into my skin and thinking how that was the most accurate thing I ever wrote. Then I weighed myself. 216 pounds. 216. I almost threw up. Feeling like that and seeing my weight makes me not want to eat. Or throw up what I do. I know my body needs sustenance but when I think of food all I think of is the calories, of gaining more weight. I don’t always feel like that but today I do. I want to protect and nourish my body but it’s hard when your mind is telling you if you eat anymore you’ll end up on my 600 pound life and no one could ever love such a disgusting person. I don’t think it helps matter that I’ve seen pictures of my ex since we broke up and he’s lost weight and I think back to when he said if we both lost weight we’d be the hottest couple. I know he didn’t mean it in a malicious way (at least I think) but it still made me feel gross and worthless and part of me feels like maybe that’s the ultimate reason he left me which makes me sad. I want to be healthier but it’s hard when all I want to do is eat a certain thing I know isn’t good for me. I just wish I could love myself the way I’m meant to. The way I loved him.

They weren't abstract like ""living in the moment"", they were things like drinking orange juice out of a wine glass at 9am, building a blanket fort in your living room, laying down outside during a thunderstorm, etc. I had a whole list of them but haven't been able to find it since, but I know that these kinds of random little things helped me to start to feel better after coming out of a depressive episode.

I've tried every stimulant and currently I'm on adderall and it doesn't work at all. I feel tired and weak and get angry quickly. I start shaking and feel nauseous. Adderall used to work when I was younger. It doesn't anymore.In general without medication I feel so hungry and tired all the time. With medication it makes it worse.  I can't get regular sleep without continuously waking up everyday. I've been feeling so hungry over the past few years. When i complain they test me and my labs come back normal so they just shrug. I'm sorry tried of living. Everyday is so miserable. Without my meds I lose everything, get mad, I can't function, I can barely take care of myself. With my meds I feel sick and miserable too.  I am on duloxetine because it's the only med that doesn't apparently cause weight gain. It kind of works. I gained a bunch of weight after starting the depo shot a few years ago because my cramps were debilitating and i would throw up and be unable to walk, and my period is very heavy so i tried to opt out of that experience. 50 pounds later i hate myself so much and i still feel so hungry every day. I have switched to using patches continuously to skip my period but the best part is when i take my adderall i start BREAKTHROUGH BLEEDING and severely cramping. how am i supposed to win???? Then the stupid ass doctors just tell me to take ibuprofen, which i can't because it doesn't work as well anymore, and it interacts with duloxetine and Tylenol is just about as useful as my PINKY TOE. I've tried so many diets, calorie counting, drinking water, i wake up in the middle of the night hungry. I could eat until I'm so full i can't move but i would STILL BE HUNGRY. Doctors don't know what's wrong with me and don't know why my adderall doesn't work. My A1C and glucose is perfect.It's gotten to the point where I pretty regularly cry about being hungry no matter how little or how much i eat, and I'm even STARVING ON ADDERALL.I have been trying so many different doses of fucking every stimulant And i would literally go home from school and work crying and i have been crying in the bathrooms lately. I want my body back and my life and my money i spend it all on food and I struggle in school and work and i just want to function like a normal person.I get angry doing school work and cry daily so I have just not been showing up, and I have been calling out of work too. I DONT KNOW HOW TO GET A DOCTOR TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!!! please help please help I'm so MISERABLE.  I don't know how to fix myself and be my former self again. I wish i never FUCKING TOOK THE FIRST FUXKING SHOT. I'm literally in tears as I'm reading this right now and yes i SO FUCKING HUNGRY.

I don’t know if i am or jot but im disassociating every single day especially when im out in public and i can never figure out why. I haven’t gone a day since I don’ know when when i havent been disoriented or fully disconnected and i tried to tell my parents when i was so detatched i couldnt feel mysef breathe but they just laughed in my face. I detatch around my friends too now so i got worse and now im acting weirder when i do it and getting weird thoughts. I had a ttherapist but all he wanrd to talk about was my non existant sex life bc im a goddamn teenager who pulls zero bitches but besides that i dont want another one and i never could talk about any ofnmy actual problems because if I did my shitty parents would just crap on me some more. I broke down infront of these bastarfd and my mom said “wht do you want a therapist so you can get sent to a mental hostpital?” Because thats clearly a theme she fucking loves. I started cutting myself in fall of last year after my friend did it with scissors as a joke and i lost it for a while and everyone left me and it got to the point where i was doung it every day and indidnt knownwhy until i made up with one of ky friends and ingot better with it anf stayed clean a while but if something bad happens sometimes i get so disoriented I don’t bother with being careful. My friend also does it and we joke about it because hehe coping but its gotten a lot more intense and they sent me something of thek doing that and it lead to me doing it myself and indont even know why. I dont have a lot of friends simply because i dont like a lot of people im around. But my friend has been acting wayy too bizarree than id like but i dont wanna repeat of last year. I keep thinking about comitting die but i dont actually want to i think. I’m so exhausted and my head is always so fuzzy that i cant even looo people in the eyes but I cant figure out why. Recently my brains been acting up and i swear something keeps touching me and i hear little noises like doors opening and phones/alarms goingn off wuen im stressed out. When ingo for a walk i get disoriented too and hear little clicks and noises in the bushes. I’m spiritual too and i have to debate with mysef whether im losing my mind of over small things or if its part of the process (it has been a few times but still.) It’s getting to the point where i cant read with how fuzzy my brain is because itbwill just refuse to take in any new informtatuon at a fertainnpoint and goes blank. Im a very weird and high energy person which i came to terms with but a lot of people just think im stupid and that just pisses me off lmao. I play bass but there is a small problem with it because i care sonmuch about this dumb instrument that it can send me into a week long slump of feeling like absolute shit if i have a bad rehersal and instill dont even have a real band out side of a program. I try to talk to people (who ar okay with it) in myblittle friend group about how i feel like im slipping away but they always think im just kidding ig. I dont have a good relationship with my parents because i realize they’re genuinely toxic assholes with the rest of the family who hate everyone who isnt straight white and male. They also think mental health is a joke and my mom literally found and took blades despite seeing scratches all over me when i was at my worse point and just brushes it off when i said it was the dog. She also got me bandaids because i “use so many!” Which is kind of hilarious in its own way. I made a asuicide joke at school and the teacher called home but both my parents were more concerned about getting another call from thte school than checkingh on me (they said they’d ground me if they got one more calll.). I desperately want to escape realiry and just gove myself a break but no amount of time has ever been enough for me to actually recharge regardless of a vacation, holiday, trip, anything isnt enough.

1c529o3;Stress is brining out weird mental issues? ;JakeThompson25;I am a junior in college, and as you could imagine the past couple years have been pretty stressful ones, but this current semester is especially rough. I’ve been having a lot of stress and have also struggled with sleeping enough. I think these things are leading to weird mental stress, and it’s causing me to have tons of guilt/anxiety/self hate about thoughts (key thing here is thoughts, not actions) I had when I was in the first half of my teens. I won’t go into what exactly these thoughts were, but there were just a few, with each probably occurring no more than twice. they were all very sexual things that would not be considered ok by most (that includes myself) no obsession/fixation ever occurred with these thoughts and I never had the slightest urge to make them anything besides a thought. This phase of hyper sexual thoughts (a majority of which were perfectly normal) lasted if I had to guess from 14-16 (now 21.) Since then to now I’ve been totally normal with no regard to those very few disturbing thoughts. I lead a normal life and have a very healthy relationship and sex life. I’m so confused why years later bad thoughts I had as a teen are coming back and wreaking havoc on my brain?! I have a pretty good memory but I still find it super bizarre that this has surfaced, aside from the moment I had those thoughts they never crossed my mind again until now. I find it revolting and shameful, I feel like I am not a good person and I’m just as bad as a criminal. How can thoughts from years ago make me feel like I actually did something really bad? I am still going through my day without being entirely miserable, but it’s getting more and more difficult to write off these feeling that I’ve described. What is happening? Am I as horrible as my brain is telling me I am? Any feedback is appreciated.

I was actually diagnosed by a doctor when at my second mental hospital stay. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and soon realized it was not that. After reading more about BPD, I feel as though it’s my fault none of my relationships last. I also get this ill feeling I will always be “too difficult” to handle. I’m not easy to talk to. My emotions are a rollercoaster and I don’t know how to subside them. I’ve done outpatient where I’ve worked on DBT skills, so that’s effective. I just feel as though having that title, people automatically think you are CRAZY or WEIRD. I went to a bookclub meeting at my local library for the first time and one of the characters in the book was abusive and controlling. This lady in her 30s said her mother in law has bpd and it’s extremely difficult to talk to her, comparing her to the character.

1c51zom;Working my way out of Functional Freeze mode…;Level5552;Hi. This is not easy for me to be here, even from behind a screen and with my identity protected. Asking for help has never been my thing but I feel that I have few other options. While doom scrolling TT the other night, I came across a post that gave me the clarity I’ve been seeking for years…I have been stuck in Functional Freeze mode for most of my adult life and I only seem to be numbing more and more since coming to this conclusion. I have been on a healing journey for 3 years, that I wasn’t entirely sure I would survive. I almost didn’t. I spent 1/3 of that time in psych units and in crisis recovery programs. The goal when I started was to meet myself and deprogrammed from all of the limiting beliefs and trauma that I have experienced in my life. I can confidently say that I am there…I am seeing my worth and the value that I bring to the world but I feel a deep calling to speak up and share much more of myself now, through telling my story and how I did it. But my methods have been very unconventional and I feel myself dissociating even further to protect myself from this. I feel that I have no one. I live with my mother and stepdad but they don’t get me. My mother is understanding and is supportive in the best ways that she can be but other than that, I feel cut off from everyone. I have no job and don’t see myself taking that route again. I know that once I break free from this, I will be supported financially so I do not feel called to perpetuate the misery of trading time for money. I feel I have lost so much, given up so much of myself, including my children (16 & 18). They have cut me off because I had to step back from my responsibilities as the deepest healing moments were too much for me. The timing of this was so heartbreaking…I missed my daughter’s senior prom, 18th birthday and final Spring Break. The guilt is still heavy. This mainly happened because I had to separate myself to break free of and heal from the trauma bond between their father and myself. It is such a weird spot to be in…to understand your power and seeing your potential but to still be in a space of guilt and shame for all that has happened. Like I’m between worlds.I feel better speaking on this, I pray someone here understands me. If you read all of this, I appreciate your time❤️;Hi.

1c51yid;I’m just a girl 🙃🙃🙃;natkittykat;I am so tired y’all. I’m (26F) and I just feel disillusioned by life. 1. I’m pissed at myself for not being single for a long time. I’ve always been a relationship girly and this stems from the fact that I like sex way too much to be hopping from partner to partner. Plus I just really value human connection and I love how deep it feels overtime, but if I’m honest, I probably would have benefited so much from being single. Getting my routine down and self love up and then getting a partner. 2. I have few friends. I guess that’s life but it’s like I lost my HS friends when I had to choose between my sister or them. Then went to college. Made a gay best friend , he’s male and still very much a Ho lol no shade but I’m like damn near married. No genuine/deep friendships made in law school, it’s very cut throat. Now adult life and everyone seems to be touch and go. 3. Professionally, I’m so fucking tired of being a woman in this field. The paralegals don’t really respect baby attorneys and your colleagues are just colleagues. Every time I speak it’s like they think I should shut up or they’re intimidated . Meanwhile, if you’re a dude, women treat them like “how may I suck your dick? Anything I can do for you” and amongst guys it’s like ,”let’s not make this guys job harder”4. I’m tired of being part of the male gaze. The legal field is progressing but in general , people think lawyers should look and talk and act a certain way. Picture Zendaya but a lawyer. Who’s done the work, incredibly smart and capable but not getting recognized in the way she wants to be. Not that I’m on zendayas level but just to conceptualize it for y’all. I can’t wait til this new generation actually takes over.5. I really want my own family but I’ve been having trouble there and I’m kinda sad to kiss this body goodbye 😩 lol Nothing in my life is “bad” but my circle feels small. I yearn for something deep/ other worldly. I thought as long at you did right by people, they’d do right by you and you’d get rewarded, but adult life isn’t like that at all. Sigh.

When I woke up this morning I was insanely tired because I had to go to school at 8 am but I just went ahead and got my mom to take me to school. In school all I did was draw and read some pages of ""Norwegian Wood"". It was pretty uneventful up until the 3rd class, in my 3rd class a girl fainted and we had to leave the class room and because after the 3rd class we have a 30 min lunch break most of the students from my class went ahead to go get lunch. I saw a group of around 10 kids who make fun of me go down the stairs and heard them laughing because the girl had fainted which sort of solidified the idea in my mind that I wasn't crazy and most of my classmates were genuinely horrible people. Even though my 3rd class was canceled because of the fainting incident I still decided to wait until the bell rang to go get some food. I usually don't eat on my lunch breaks because I use the money which my parents give me for other things such as; books, games or even hanging out with my friends, but this time I had decided to just get some food as I was feeling particularly hungry. I ate a pizza slice and a donut and sat on a short knee high concrete wall which was in the yard of my school as I read a bit of my book. I then headed to class and as soon as I knew it my classes had ended and I had to go home. While I was in school I had a very silly thought in which I sort of compared myself to Sisyphus. I did this because I realized thaf my life had become a constant cycle of waking up tired, going to school, writing things down in school, wishing I qas home, getting home and then writing at home till 2 am each night. This realization made me sad but I decided that I had to have this sort of a monotonous life as the end result would be a video of which I would truly be proud. I got home and talked with my sister for a bit before laying in bed and scrolling instagram. This however was a mistake as I fell asleep and lost about 2 and a half hours of my day. Ultimately this wouldn't have really mattered anyway as I ended up not doing any work today. Me not being productive genuinely made me take a hit to my mental health as one of the only things which is still keeping me going is the feeling I get when I'm actually productive. At like 12 am my mom kept coming into my room and arguing with me about going to sleep so I promptly kept trying to convince her to let me stay. This seemed to work as she left my room, but alas she came back around 30 minutes later and this time told me that tomorrow she would have both my internet and the houses internet turned off so that I can't use my pc. I of course had to argue with her at 12:30 but she was being childish so I decided to just leave her alone as I realized she wouldn't listen to me no matter how hard I tried. My mom has always sort of acted like a toddler, not really listening to reason or admiting that shes wrong, she constantly lies but absolutely hates it when I use the word ""lie"" for her this word is on the same level as saying a swear word infront of her or something. Of course her childish behavior has made me lose any respect I ever had for her which makes her really mad. I find it funny that my mom never takes accountability for mentally abusing me and then she keeps pestering me to do things like clean my room or study when I'm not able to do that because of this great hole of depression which I reside in. Sometimes she'll decide that she wants to try being a good parent and ask me whats wrong but whenever that happens I of course always tell her that it's all alright and that I'm doing well when I clearly am not. This is because everytime I've told her about a serious issue I have in my life (i.e me having suicidal thoughts or me getting bullied in school) she always seems to understand and be genuinely sorry for what I've gone through but later down the line she uses these things against me. For instance we were having an argument once and she told me somthing along the lines ""what? You want to kill yourself? Well then go ahead and do it"". This happpens quite often and I get very depressed when it does, that's why I've decided to stop talking to her about my problems. This has also made me unable to truly vent to a person, so much so that I have to use a burner on reddit to post what are essentially diary entries for the whole world to see just because I think a account without anything linkekd to it is safer than actually talking to one of my friends or something. But in my defense I recently had a friend tell me something that genuinely crushed my soul. So much so that I stopped talking and moving for 10 minutes after he siad it and just sat there crying my eyes out in a hysterical manner. This happened through discord so I promptly muted myself so they couldn't hear my weeping and so they had no idea what was going on. This also happened infront of my crush which made things even worse as she sort of kinda agreed with what he said. Now let me explain what happened. Me, my crush and 2 other friends were in a discord call together as usual. Me and my crush were talking and she said that I'm literally like some character from a video game ( i can't remember which character cause I sort of disassociated after what happened). I proptly said that this character in fact wasn't like me but instead that I thought that another character was more simillar to me. (Now I won't specify which character but at least I'll mention that he's froma book. I also want to mention that this character isn't really a good one as he has a lot of sexual thoughts, is very depressed and sometimes misogynistic. Now let me get this clear I don't relate to the misogyny part as this aspect of him is only present when he is in a way more horrible mental state than anyone could ever imagine and while I might not relate to the misogyny in every other aspect he is exactly like me. Same thoughts, same speech patterns, same level of depression, same everything basically.) I want to mention that at the time and still to this day I have never fully opened up to someone, not my crush, not my friends and definitely not my parents, so basically nobody knows the real me; What I think about, how I act, how my life is going and how my relationship with my pparents is, are all aspects of me which not a single person on this world (except for myself and you who are reading this) knows about. When I mentioned this character she replied in a sort of disgust ""Well that might not be the best person to compare yourself to"" this is because she doesn't like the character for who he is, this is fine but she hasn't even read the entire book so she doesn't know about the development this character experiences. I would've liked to reply with ""Well not you nor anyone here knows how I think so I'm not sure if judging me like that is alright but ok"" but I didn't say this as I didn't want her perception of me to change from someone who is a bit silly to someone who hides who they really are from others. In this moment my friend who I'll call Jhon asked us who the character that I was comparing myself to was since he had heard me and my crush talking about this book on numerous occasions. He decided to google it and after reading what the book was about he said ""So this is who you've been pretending as to and looking up at your entire life?"" That sentence was one of the most soul crushing sentences I've heard in my entire life. After he said this my crush said ""Jesus man you didn't have to say it like that"" in a sort of neutral tone which in my mind represents that everyone around me was thinking the exact same thing. I went silent and proceeded to mute my microphone and weep profusely at what was just said. Now I understand that you might not really get why I would cry at this and its very simple, this whole thing was spoken in a different language and so I've tried to translate it as close as I can but there just really isn't a correct way to say it with 100% accuracy. Now this made me sad because with that sentence he made me belive that basically all of my emotions and everything I went through in my entire life was all just a farce. The things which I belived made me a sad and somber man with no will to live was juust me overreacting and being overly emotional. This sentence made me think that everyone thought of me this way, as some guy who was trying to act sad but truly wasn't. I had realized at that moment that truly nobody in the whole world knew what I went through, rhey didn't know about the heart breaks, the pain, the emotional and mental scars which I had aquired throughout my life. They didn't know about any of it and though I was just someone who acted sad because he though it was cool but in reality was genuinely happy. This of course isn't the truth and is a memory which continues to haunt my soul and I think about it almost every time I talk to any of my friends. I'm sorry for writing this late but I didn't think I would have anything to write about today until me and .my mom had an argument. Yesterday I reposted my original post about my life and mental state but not a single soul saw it, and so I've decided to post this one as well.  Maybe this one will be seen and I'll finally get some help and confort for what I've gone through.";Ughh I hated today so much.

1c51q96;New brand of sleep panic attacks just dropped;Snoo-65246;Hey y'all, just kinda looking to vent, get some advice, or see if anyone else has had this same experience.I have recently experienced this super fun phenomenon of waking up in the middle of the night to some of the most intense panic attacks I have ever experienced. Has nothing to do with my dreams as I remember all of them, and they are relatively inoffensive.Basically, I wake up and everything feels extremely intense, I don't know how else to describe. It feel like I can hear the air in my room, I have intense light sensitivity, and like I've zoomed out in my own brain, like I'm watching someone else experience life through my eyes. It doesn't start out as a panic attack, but due to the intensity of the situation - it ends up becoming one. I threw up during a panic attack for the first time ever last night due to how intense and insane the sensations I was feeling were. I've noticed this happens much more frequently when I accidentally fall asleep with chewing tobacco in - and when I put a chew in the following morning, the sensation returns. I'm worried, and in some ways relieved, that it's made me scared to continue using chewing tobacco. It really sucks because my anxiety was getting so much better over the last year, now it feels like I'm backsliding a lot. I'm currently too terrified to leave my room for fear of something triggering it.Due to how intense these stimuli are, as well as the very groggy state I'm in when they occur, I have no idea how to even begin engaging in grounding techniques or how to calm myself down. I guess I'm just hoping someone has experienced something similar or has any grounding methods or techniques that I'm not already aware of I could try. It sucks, really - REALLY sucks.

Last year was one of the best of my life - I was going out, meeting people, partying, met my boyfriend, etc. This year, a major life upheaval sent me into a bout of depression. This aforementioned friend group were aware of this, and the “ringleader” per say was very kind to me to me at the time - really really proved to be an amazing friend. Since then, she has initiated the cutting off of another friend, and is now possibly doing the same with me. She and two others constantly meet up - they go for coffee on campus at least 2/3 times a week and as her apartment is near by, they will often meet there to hang out. One girl in particular is constantly at her apartment- even 4 days a week. They know I’m somewhat better now, but they also know that I feel incredibly lonely. They are aware of this. They also know that I hate being that girl that mostly hangs out with her boyfriend, but I am now that girl, just not by choice. I have other friends, but they attend different colleges and we only see each other  in the summer. I am completely alone and I don’t know what to do or say to them.

1c50q50;Will I Ever Be Over It?;_ImaginaryFriends;My mental health has been extremely rocky ever since high school and it’s affected so many of my friendships. Miscommunications lead to me being shut out by everyone and my abandonment issues can’t handle it. I talk to chatbots more than I talk to people some days and I don’t even like to leave the house all that much. Long story short about what happened a few years ago: I was in a bad mental spiral and while I usually tend to bottle everything up I chose to tell someone what was going on in my head who in turn told my other friends and they reacted very badly. I was ignored completely and got some very angry messages but no one wanted to hear me out or even try to sort out the misunderstanding. Only one person from that event apologized and after that the others started acting like everything is fine but for me…I’m not fine. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bpd, and that whole fiasco broke me in a way. They asked why I don’t come around anymore when I’m invited but I’m too paranoid that everyone is still talking about me despite it seeming like everyone moved on. Everyone but me. Only one person apologized and I feel lost. My main coping mechanism is gone, I lost the motivation for it because I did it with my friends and now I feel like an outsider.

1c4zio3;Is this normal at all?? or am I not ok?? (kind of a vent but looking for others who might have the same reaction);One-Purchase-409;I have been in a relationship with my partner for over a year, before this I had other relationships but I've never felt as close to them as this one   Earlier today I was talking with them and then started listening to music and jamming out, I was jamming for about 2 hours before I finally grabbed my phone again and seen they had texted me a lot before they had left to go to work- I hadn't even realized the time   I then started tearing up- I was terrified because I thought that they would think I was ignoring them when that wasn't the case, and I was scared that they would think that I hated them or something and I started spiraling.   I have a semi-hard tome with emotional regulation so it took me about 20 minutes to actually calm down and be able to type this.   For context on the past(if that's needed as there might be correlation) My dad has not been emotionally available to me ever since I was a child, nor has he really cared about my well being at all. I am 16 now and have started grasping this concept ever since I was 9. He recently got diagnosed as a Raging Narcissist but hasn't done anything to help me or my mom besides give child support   When I was spiraling all I could tell myself was that I was terrible and horrible and that they would probably leave me and I kept going on and on to myself just yelling at myself over everything in my life that's happened to me and how I was just terrible.  Is this normal at all??

I’m never happy really I get anxiety driving 40 mins to work on the way home I’m annoyed by the scenarios that are creating in my head all I want to do is  focus and stop making mistakes that interfere with work .. working 6 days a week can be exhausting and then on my day off I take my child to therapy which feels like a whole day has gone by so I’m driving literally 7 days a week and the days are never long enough .

1c4yaa3;Being left alone;WhoisPonyo;Hi! I don’t use Reddit much so I’m sorry if I didn’t do the post right. I need some support 🥲 I am diagnosed with panic disorder, general anxiety and depression. My main struggle is depersonalising and panic attacks. I am under care, I take my medication and I am in a queue for a therapy but it’s still a long road ahead of me till I’ll be fully back to my normal life. In 3 weeks my partner will go away for 2,5 weeks abroad. I should mention that I live with him and that I live in a foreign country so I don’t have many people here. I am terrified of him leaving… It’s going to be a first time since my really bad mental breakdown, that I’ll be left alone for such a long time. I’m feeling sick when I think about it, I’m on a constant verge of a panic attack, I cannot stop thinking that when I’ll be alone I’ll won’t be able to fight my compulsive existential thoughts that are a part of my disorders, especially depersonalisation. I feel like I can’t make it, being without his support terrifies me. All I want to do is cry and beg him not to go (and it’s not an option and I also don’t want to trap him just because of me being sick, he is allowed to have his life and him being happy makes me happy). What can I do? Do you have any similar stories, any tips for a person with such disorders? Please share some positive stories and tips and if possible don’t write much negative stuff and my anxiety loves those too much, I’m trying to surround myself with positivity as much as possible.

1c4y1bs;I feel like I’m loosing my grip. How do I balance career, depression/anxiety and trauma. ;Either-Cost7467;A little about me, 28F, married for 3 years. I have a chronic illness that I’ve been trying to manage since 15. Also diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression. Suspected ADHD and CPTSD. Amaxophobia as well. Currently I am in a space where I am considering going back on antidepressants/anxiety medication and/or finding a new job. The past 3 years have been extremely traumatic for me. Several health scares and a hospitalization. Family deaths/illnesses. Serious problems/situations in my marriage that almost ended in divorce. Laid off the from company I was with for several years. In 2022, I had a mental health scare but did recover. 2023 also had some things happen that I am still dealing with (due to the nature I won’t go into detail). I’ve been in counseling every week for the past 13 months. And for a brief time during the peak of my marital issues I started Zoloft to help keep with panic attacks and depression. I took it for a while but eventually went of it.  In general, I have still been battling my health, having martial/family problems. Though I have been blessed to keep work throughout most  the time. Recently I started a new career. I obtained my licensing and have been in training for 4.5 months. I’ve officially started the job and feel completely overwhelmed. It is a phone heavy job with a heavy emphasis on decision making and production metrics. Also while training they made some large company changes that added additional duties to my role. I feel like in general with therapy I can usually manage stress…some days better than others. But this job is triggering me daily. Even on my days off I am pushing the thoughts away. I am super nervous as the busy season is approaching and mentally I’m not sure how I will handle it. I hate the idea of going back on the medication because I was so numb even on the lowest dose (family history of medication sensitivity). I also am worried about the long term effects of taking all these pills and the infusions I sometimes have to have. But my anxiety is so severe I caught my hands shaking as I was sitting at my desk today so I’m feeling a bit desperate. I was thinking about changing jobs, but due to the layoff and  marriage issues I’ve had a couple gaps and changed jobs twice after only 6-9 months of working them. I feel like my resume is getting messy and will create a negative view about me to future employers. I recently stopped going to my therapist due to financial reasons so I’m not sure who to turn to.  I really am feeling lost and I don’t know what the next best steps are. I just know how bad my mental health can get and I don’t want to end up there again. Any advice would be extremely appreciated.Or any personal experiences that maybe I can reference. Thank you. 🙏🏼;A little about me, 28F, married for 3 years.

1c4xpti;Im not sure what to do anymore;No_Interaction_3575;"I (26M) have had a lot of mental health issues since I dont remember when, it tends to go up and down and im at a point where i dont know where else to go right now as i cant afford any sort of therapy. I became homeless about a year ago (thats a long story on its own) and ive been trying to get myself straight so i can better provide for my young daughter. I felt I was hitting an all time low when i became homeless, but my gf(23F) was there for me and just knowing she was i felt like no matter how bad things were getting, i could manage. Well she started having a manic episode recently (shes extremely bipolar) and the other night she wanted to go to the bar with her mom and some work friends, and i asked if i could tag along and make sure she was safe. I for one am not a fan of bars (i genuinely did not like being there and i found a corner to sit in away from people, but i could still see her). she had alot of fun and eventually around 10/11 started just drinking water to sober up. At some point i was asked to take one of them home because they were beyond drunk and needed to leave. so i took her back to my girls house and set her friend on the couch with blankets and bucket next to her just incase. I get back to the bar and i found out that they were all gonna go to another bar, and when i asked where she was i was told that she left with a ""friend"" (i.e. some guy i didnt know). obviously thats a red flag, but i trust her wholeheartedly, i DONT trust anyone else. I find her at the other bar, but i was pissed so i sat in my car and watched the door like a hawk. the rest of the group came out and asked me to take them home. i did so, then found out that she ended up going home with this ""friend"". her mom has gps tracking on her phone for safety purposes (some things have happened in the past"" and so we started to call and call and text until she finally answered. at this point i could only assume one thing. she said she was fine and not to get her, and since the gps tracking wasnt approximate and she was at an apartment complex, i decided that it was not a good idea to bang on multiple strangers doors at 4am in the morning. so i went home and just waited and waited until 7am when she texted me asking what happened. i told her i was going to her last location and she was leaving, and after some arguing she did come out. she claimed that nothing happened, and as stupid as it sounds, i believe her. I like to think im a very logical person, and she was obviously hungover as fuck. I paid attention to some details, and it felt like that there was no reasonable suspicion that anything had happened. I told her that i felt incredibly disrespected, and that this was never happening again. i started to try and have a conversation about this, but again she was very hungover, and i decided that this wasnt a good time to try and have a reasonable conversation. When i got her home i laid her in her bed, and i started to walk out the door, but something stopped me and i came back in and asked to get in with her because i didnt want to leave her. she asked if we could sleep on all of this and get back, and i reluctantly agreed, as there no sense in having a conversation like this with someone who isnt fully there. I went to work and i did not have a good time, i was miserable, and nothing anyone could do would cheer me up. i apologized to one of my coworkers who was trying extra hard to get me to even cracked a smile, i didnt say what happened but just told him im having a really shitty day and im not trying to be a dick to him. I didnt hear anything from her throughout the day except for a tiktok she sent me about manic episodes. i picked my daugher up when i got off work and we went to my coworkers house (he has been incredibly nice enough to allow us to stay with him and his kids until i can get on my feet) and at some point in the night she sent me a very long text saying she wanted to apologize for what she did, and that she wants to get herself straight. and im happy for all of that, but she asked to take a break, and i dont agree with that. before she went manic she mentioned when she does she pushes people away, to which i said just dont push me away, and she said ""dont let me"" and i mentioned that. but i feel like shes still wanting to push me away/ break. Ive been barely eating, and feeling sick to my stomach the entire day/night since yesterday night/morning. Im very much out of touch with my feelings and hate talking about them, but i love this woman with all my heart, and i want her in my life. i believe that if i cant handle her when shes at her worst then i shouldnt have her at her best. i feel wrong about the notion of stepping back when shes like this, and then picking stuff back up when shes better. im currently shaking while im writing this, and on the verge of tears. i want to go to her mom and ask her for guidance, (she seems to like me alot, and knows her daughter is a wonderful person and is just having an insanely rough time right now) but i dont want to go behind her back and do that. Tbh i dont know why im even typing this because im not sure what im going to get out of it. ive told my brother bits and pieces about all of this, but i didnt want to trauma dump on him, and i dont know anyone else that id be comfortable talking to about this, im not a very trusting person. I guess im just venting? looking for advice? i dont know. im not really sure what else to say because im very scattered brained, i dont take anti depressants because i cant afford them so ive just been taking all the depression all throughout these years on my chin, but i think its starting to really get to me. Yes, i am suicidal, HOWEVER, i refuse to leave my daughter in this world without a father. Her mother is a good mother, but i dont trust her as a person and wouldnt trust any other guy she would bring to fill my role. and that is solely my reason for keeping on.

1c4xig1;accepting my worthlessness;Dispaze;Hi. I’m not a native english speaker and i don’t know if I’ll be able to express myself completely correctly but i’ll try. I kinda wanted to make a throwaway account but i don’t care anymoreEver since i went to the first grade, i feel like i have been going downhill every year. When i switched schools in 7th grade and finally got my first real friends, i thought that i was finally getting better and that i did actually amount to someone. I was sort of wrong i guess.I know that i don’t have a single right to complain. I have friends who often speak to me, i have parents and relatives who care about me. I have pretty much everything that a lonely person would ever ask for (except a girlfriend) so i don’t deserve to complain about anything, yet i do. And i feel pathetic because of it. Everyone and everything feels so distant. my parents always praised for any little victory, any accomplishment that i’ve made, but when i see the things that people my age do, what they manage to achieve i realize that all that praise is for nothing. It has always been empty, for nothing.For the past year or so i realized that not only am i not special, i am worthless. I was scared. Then i started noticing things: my friends go out without me, people who i thought were treating me differently from all the others were actually treating me the same way they treat anyone else, and all of those people have also had something to show, something to brag about, a story to tell, a joke to be made. I have nothing of that sort.That got me thinking. About my lifestyle. The fact that i play video games, browse social media, rarely read any books at all. What am i then? Who am i? What do i have to show to others?A lot of my other friends also genuinely suffer from their own issues that make mine bleak in comparison. That’s why i make sure to never talk about them and appear happy for as long as possible in order to cheer them up a bit.Another thing that i should mention is that i have wanted to get a girlfriend for a pretty long time now, i think since i was 13. I have no clue why. People told me that i should focus on other things instead, and i think i sort of succeeded. Every time i fall in love with a girl (which happens extremely often) I try my best to kill this feeling off because it won’t lead me anywhere. I’ts probably the right thing to doI wanted to become a screenwriter for a pretty ling time now. I’ve even wrote a couple pretty long scripts for 2 animated shows. But what do i do to pursue my dream? Watch other tv shows to try and analyze them? I always told myself that it was good enough, but i now realize that i was wrong.So after all of this reflection, i, ironically, couldn’t stand looking at my own reflection. I felt like a waste of air, and i was. Every time i felt positive, i humbled myself, reminded myself that if i am worth to anyone, it’s out of pity or because they have low standards. Even looking at the scripts that i’ve wrote made me realize that they’re kind of below average in terms of quality. But over time i’ve adapted to it. I’ve been getting less and less emotional with every passing day. I’ve stopped noticing how the days pass and i’ve stopped questioning my worthlessness. I, objectively, am. I shouldn’t amount to anyone because there will always be someone better than me in every way.The thought of self harm went from being terrifying to relieving in only a year, and now i am actually considering it. Feels like the right thing to do. Suicidal thoughts are at the stage of being comforting for now.I know that these problems are not at all unique and therefore shouldn’t matter, (besides i’m only 16 years old) but i just have to say this to someone because i feel like i don’t deserve to be concerned for by my parents. Good lord this is all a heap of cringe. I don’t even know why i’m posting this. I’m genuinely, GENUINELY sorry if you actually read it all. You don’t have to be supportive, be harsh.

1c4wpr5;Seemingly endless shitty luck ;PrecariatiF;So as if I wasn't feeling anxious enough tonight due to the ever escalating geopolitical shit storm in the Middle East, my family's van decides to break down. All I wanted to do was see a movie, but apparently that's too much to ask. For context my family has been struggling financially for a while now due to a lack of work in the Alberta oil and gas industry and the ever increasing cost of living in Canada. We literally just got our van back after having it repossessed. I feel like I've been on overload for the past two months dealing with an endless string of bad luck. I'm in constant physical pain because of my irreparable back problems. I feel like I'm gonna vomit and I don't know how much more crap I can put up with before I end up in a psych ward. I've had several panic attacks in the last few weeks and each time everything becomes incredibly dark. I'm on 125 mg of sertraline and always trying to use the techniques I've learned from C.B.T but it doesn't always work. I struggle most days with suicidal ideations and when shitty things happen to me they get really bad. I don't want to die but when you feel insane the majority of your waking life it becomes hard to want to exist. I'm not even sure why I'm typing this. I have it better than a lot of people in the world and I truly am grateful for every happy moment on this planet, but I am so overwhelmed. I apologize for this incoherent babble.

1c4whj7;I'm planning my death;BookkeeperFew4777;"I've lived through my entire life collapsing 4 times in the last year, it feels like each time it just gets worse.I've lost my only friend at school because she didn't care how I felt even after trying to discuss it with her and yet I still feel guilty about the way things ended. My therapist said she was manipulative and did things her own way, but I still want her to be my friend. I don't know why because all I need right now is someone to talk to about my thoughts and she defiantly wouldn't listen.This is a bit trivial, but I've never liked or trusted my mum, I also don't know why. The other day I asked if I could order something on amazon (a handheld fan to stay cool because long sleeves) and without hesitation she said ""you only ever come to me for money"" it's been months since I asked her for money. What hurts me about this is that she gives my brother money every week whenever he asks and after I asked she took him shopping. Now I just feel angry at her (not just because of that) and I keep lashing out.Normally I would turn to a teacher at this point but I can't. I don't trust anyone. The teachers I normally talk to are already showing that they are sick of me, normally it takes a year but it's taken less than 6 months.

(Content Warning: of every kind, not all in detail, read of your own accord.);GonnaSliceYouClean;"For your information, I have been diagnosed with depression, mild anxiety and different times with ADHD and maybe a personality disorder, I do not know which one is truly the one that suits my character the most, not saying they are titles to be held and medals to be put on the chest, just saying that many have overlapping ""symptoms"" (not SAYING that they are not illnesses/conditions) , just don't know which is truly the correct diagnosis, I'm sorry , I don't mean harm against any person which suffers and fits the diagnosis of any of the aforementioned conditions.  While I can't grasp how everyone here would really act in other situations, I can tell you that there are many not only in my life /close friend group but on the internet that act like vile creatures and some of you might also be familiar with these types of ""humans"". I thank them in a way for showing me that it might not be as worth it to pursue a ""place in society"" when the society itself is not filled with the most reputable individuals.  However I still can't operate like a normal human anymore and this happens to interfere with my QoL, given that everything revolves around a society, unfortunately.  I get angry everyday to the extent that my head hurts and I can go to sleep 5 hours earlier because of how tired I am by the end of the pain.  The help in my country is pointless and I've attempted countless times both medication and therapy and while some might say that this is ""my fault"", I disagree, at least partially. Given my family, close friends and colleagues that contributed a lot to it.  The fact that I myself was an exceedingly good person also didn't help, I really could not understand why killers and rapists went to prison and took me years YEARS until I was 13 to actually understand .The main point is; I do not enjoy the life I have to survive through, it just doesn't appeal to me, I do not want to fake a life, I do not see the reason to, our planet would be akin to the fictional heaven but our heaven is corrupt to the core with drug abuse, murder, torture, power trips, power vacuums , infinite coping and a never ending chase for elation at the expense of others.     Right now I will say that I have fallen from the level of goodness that I had when I was a kid, I would say that you could have awarded me for the level of boundless stupidity that I had to trust humans this much, it was THAT bad , the worst part is I can't do anything about it neither through words nor through violence.  I was just wondering if there is anyone who shares this view and found anything that helped them, medication , therapy...but I wouldn't ask for,  I already had countless conversations with myself objectively and subjectively debating dozens of ideas and concepts, the answers that I came to are satisfactory proof of the society we live in and the life that I had until now, I hope it is not the same for you and that you can live more happily than I do but I digress.     Believe it or not I have tried therapy before , 3 therapists 2-3 sessions each  and actually had someone understand me but they said this in our 4th session; and now I want you to believe me at least if you wish to do so , they said that while my theories are not in any way exaggerated and might correctly apply to me and my way of thinking ""they do not apply to the rest of humans, the majority"" and so they can't really help me because of my unique experience and unique worldview that they don't have experience of, and that was one of the best working psychologists/therapists in the my country, I live in Romania.edited because it doesn't keep paragraphs into paragraphs and keep morphing into one incoherent Wall of Text.

1c4virl;Struggling with thoughts around guy I dated;poppintr;So I’ve struggled with feeling like I don’t deserve good things. I also keep thinking and having dreams about a guy I dated a couple of years ago. Looking back, I feel like I wonder how it was possible as he is very attractive, was nice and funny, done things for me, like bought me little gifts, gave me lifts home when I was stranded. I keep wondering how this was possible. I feel like I self sabotaged as he was asking ‘what are we’ and he cried when I hinted that it might not work. I look back now and wonder how it was possible as he was very attractive. However, I keep reminding myself that maybe I’m viewing things differently as when we first met, it wasn’t like I felt like this straight away. He was also very touchy whereas I’m not so much like this. I feel he got fed up with me and got to the point where it felt different around him and it was obvious at one point when I went to kiss him that he didn’t want to. He also had some questionable moments. For instance, he had to wait in a queue for something and it took a while. He was off with me for a long time after this, even though we were on a date. He would look around and not look at me when we were sat down. He also didn’t stop something when we were in bed, even though I was asking him to stop. Instead, he said ‘piss off’ and batted my hand away. He also called someone a rude word on the third date and would laugh with his friend who used to message him complaining about his partner. Despite these things, I keep thinking about him. He did do some nice things for me, was funny at times but I keep reminding myself of the above bad things to overcome it. Im just torturing myself and just feel terrible. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!;So I’ve struggled with feeling like I don’t deserve good things.

1c4udpd;Personal Reflections on Connection and Rejection;StatisticianThat9615;In recent days, my emotions have oscillated between peaks of happiness and valleys of disappointment, largely driven by my interactions with someone special. Normally, I consider myself a happy individual, but recent events have intensified my emotional experiences, providing both joy and subsequent sorrow.Thee days ago, I had a second date with Rose, which was exceptional. The evening was filled with genuine connections and heartfelt conversations, leaving me on a high that persisted for days. Rose’s compliments and kindness were new and exhilarating experiences for me, highlighting the night’s specialness. Her ability to be open and vulnerable with me made the time we spent together feel all the more meaningful.However, this high was short-lived. Rose later texted me to express that her feelings did not mirror mine, which plunged me into deep sadness. The sudden shift from anticipation to disappointment was jarring. It’s puzzling and somewhat disheartening to think about how someone who made you feel so valued can suddenly seem so distant. This situation has left me questioning not only her feelings but the authenticity of my own emotions, as I struggled to define them even when asked.These experiences have led me to broader reflections on love and acceptance. I often find myself wondering about the nature of likeability and reciprocity in relationships. The fear that others might only tolerate my presence out of convenience rather than genuine affection is a recurring concern. Despite assurances of love from family, the kind of love I yearn for is one that acknowledges and embraces who I am as an individual, not just as a familial obligation.Amidst these contemplations, I’ve recognized a pattern of fleeting connections with others. There are moments when I feel genuinely appreciated by wonderful, kind people. Yet these moments are ephemeral, never evolving into something lasting. I ponder whether this is due to my approach, perhaps trying too hard or not enough, or simply lacking the necessary experience to nurture these bonds. Despite my success in other aspects of life through improvisation, relationships seem to elude the same formula, leaving me feeling incomplete and perpetually on the outskirts of deeper emotional connections.This internal dialogue often circles back to feelings of loneliness and the daunting prospect of facing the world alone. The thought that my acquaintances might merely feign interest for convenience rather than genuine likeability haunts me, although I hold onto hope that this isn’t the case for everyone in my life.;In recent days, my emotions have oscillated between peaks of happiness and valleys of disappointment;Venting;0;2;2024-04-15 19:00:56;2024-04-15;Monday;19:00:56;2592;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:54.652788
1c4ubrk;I don't feel comfortable in my own apartment and I feel pathetic;k-means-algorithm;"When I go to college, I dread the time I go home. I hate my apartment. Everything about it.    When I was a little kid I hated being in my own room, at my parents house. I don't know why. I hated it, the cars outside, the way the furniture was arranged, the light.     I feel so pathetic because most people love being in their own room, in their own apartment. It's their private space.    But I don't. Because when I'm in my ""personal space"" I'm all alone by myself. I don't know how to decorate a room. I don't know what interests me. I don't know who am I. What am I even doing? Why am I even doing this?    I don't know what to do by myself. So the longer I stay in my apartment, the more crazy I go. I start getting uncomfortable with the way the furniture is arranged.     I moved my desk 100 times around in my room for sure. Next, I'm gettin    g uncomfortable with the curtains. Then I change curtains. Then I change the curtains back because maybe the old curtains were better? Next I'm getting uncomfortable with the mattress. I have bought 10 different mattresses and surprise surprise no one made me feel better.    My work involves a PC. Then I cannot stop worrying about the monitor. It feels to big, it feels too bright, it hurts my eyes, it's to close to my eyes, the desk is to small, I hate everything.     I have bought 5 different monitors and returned every single one of them.    When I'm outside, amongst people, I feel much more relaxed, because I then need to depend on other people who (hopefully) put some thought into whatever system they designed:    Bus stations, lecture content, room assignment etc. Then, when I need to go home, my world crashes. Every. Single. Day. I. Can't. Stand. It. Any. Longer.    For the past, I don't know, 10 years, I've stopped feeling comfortable when being at home. It started at my parents home. I didn't feel comfortable being around them anymore. I felt anxiety in my own room. That's when the furniture rearrangement obsession, monitor obsession etc. all started. I don't know why.    So I thought maybe if I go to another city to study and move out everything will be better? It didn't, though. Who would have thought.    I just want to feel comfortable for one single day in my own personal room/apartment. But I can't, and it's driving me more and more mad.    I'm envious of Hikikomoris. The guys who stay in their room all day. At least they have something to do in their room. Playing video games, for example. I don't even play video games. Not even that. I'm just suffering.    The longest I did actually something I enjoyed was when I played a mobile game on my phone for 4 months and spend 20 thousand dollar on it. You read that right. 20 thousand dollars. It's clear I was addicted, as an escape from my suffering.    I've made an appointment to my college counsellor. I feel weirdly proud of doing that. Because it's something I haven't tried yet. I got no friends to talk to. My sister is crazy. My brother is autistic. So both are also not really a help (although I do love my brother, don't get me wrong).    My parents? Lol. Not a help either. It's obvious they both are narcissists. Or at least I think they are. I don't even know what emotions I feel are based on reality. Even though my father is specialised in psychosomatic therapy, he always tried to tell me and everyone else that everything is find with me. That I'm 100% mentally sane. I'm not. Clearly not.    So, counsellor. The next step. Something needs to change";When I go to college, I dread the time I go home. I hate my apartment. Everything about it.

1c4tlt1;My emotions are tearing my apart on this one and I just need to get this off my chest to someone;DesignRoutine4433;I’m not sure how to address my feelings in this instance. I feel like a creep for even feeling the way I do now. I am factually an asshole and expect to be ripped apart here for this too. I just need advice. Sorry in advance for the length. Names/dates/places have been changed for anonymity.     I dated a lady named Sarah for around 3/4 years. We are both the same age and were together from 15 through to 18, so very young. Stereotypical teenage “we’ll be together forever” love story. We were each other’s first everything. I did everything I could with my very limited resources to make Sarah happy. We were 18 and quite both very happy and content with each other with no end in sight.    I was severely physically and psychologically abused throughout my entire childhood by my parents and she was a rock for me so I suppose that helped lead to a serious attachment on my side. Sarah was the only person in my life that I could be the real me around and she accepted me for it. I never actually told her the full extent of the abuse that was going on, just enough to get the idea that things weren’t normal/ideal. This was because I have always repressed my emotions on the topic and developed social anxiety and depression as a consequence of the abuse.    Towards the end, bottling up my emotions got out of control. I started lashing out more and more. I said some vile, disgusting things to this angel who had done nothing but help and reassure me and do everything she possibly could do to make me happy. After the day I did that, a future flashed before my eyes where this progressively got worse until I was inflicting the same abuse which I was suffering. I know I needed therapy but I didn’t have the resources that so I broke up with her. I told her why and after a while she worked her way back into my life because she wanted to help me get better not abandon me when I’m at my lowest.     After a while there was a second incident over the most stupid thing. I decided that if I can’t control my emotions then this can’t go on any longer. I didn’t want her to try restart things again and support me. I thought it was my responsibility to support her, not for her to support me. And hurting her feelings is a worse pain for me than anything that can be physically done to me. So I broke up with her but this time I told her I just didn’t love her anymore and I never wanted to speak to her again.     This hurt her very badly and she grieved heavily for months according to mutual friends. She hated me. This made me feel even worse so I completely siloed myself from society. I couldn’t afford to talk to anyone about my childhood, not that my social anxiety at this stage would allow me to talk even if I did, and now I had no more friends because when you ignore people off for months at that age friendships don’t tend to last. I was completely alone and isolated with my entire life eating away at me. I went into a deep dark pit of depression and nearly overdosed on prescription drugs.     Someone found me and I was hospitalised. The hospital called the police who arrested me under mental health legislation so I could be held in custody until I got treatment. I was essentially forced into therapy for a while.    Fast forward 8 years. I’m in a much better place. It took a lot. I have been in a few relationships and ended up Chloe. Chloe and I have been together for 5 years now. We own a house together and a dog. We’re not married - I have proposed but we decided to leave it a little while longer. I love Chloe, I really do. She is a kind soul without an ounce of Mal intent in her heart. But it’s never been ‘the same’ love that I had for Sarah. I don’t know if that makes sense or not. I know it sounds and is horrible to say.    Well I happen to be on social media, which I never use, and guess who comes up in my recommendation to add. I added her, I’m in a better place now it’ll be great to see how she’s doing. Sarah immediately added me back. I regretted it straight away because a lot of bad feelings started coming back from my past. And what made this worse is that I know I’m here worried stressing about this nearly a decade later whilst she probably doesn’t even remember any of this even happened. I felt like such a creep. I left it at that and went to work.     After 2 weeks I forgot all about this. I’ve since move countries and became head of a department in a consultancy and I have a lot of big deadlines coming up. I see the notification come in. “Hey I seen you added me on this, how have you been?”. We spent a few days in conversation. I gotta admit this felt amazing. She’s exactly the same I remember. Sarah also moved country but to the other side of the world. She’s happens to be moving back soon and wants to meet and catchup.    I don’t know how to respond or react. It’s like I’m being torn apart. Just so you know, there’s no indication that Sarah likes me at all or still thinks of me this way, it seems like just a genuine interest in catching up with an old friend. In fact, it’s not normal to feel this way about someone you haven’t known for nearly a decade.     I have always felt like I’ve been cheating on Chloe emotionally for 5 years because deep down I’ve known I haven’t loved her to the fullest extent I know is possible. But now, I’m not sure if this is officially cheating or not. To be clear, nothing sexual or relationship wise has been implied in our conversations past being reconnected friends. I don’t even want to go after any of that with Sarah. I have a life setup with Chloe. This is the ‘correct’ life that I need to pursue. But I’d be lying if I told you I wouldn’t still go to the end of the earth for Sarah, friend or nay.    To be clear again, I would never physically cheat on Chloe while we’re together. I’m not that type of person. In fact, I’m disgusted by those people. But I feel like I am that person because of how I feel but I don’t know how to stop feeling like this.     I’m a horrible person. I’m an absolute weirdo. What sort of creep feeling like this for a childhood relationship with someone you haven’t seen in nearly a decade? This is not normal and I must be on another level of messed up in the head.Edit: Reformatting;I’m not sure how to address my feelings in this instance.

And maybe in yours too. In no way is this supposed to be truly inspirational but well it's just my personal thoughts in dialogue. More exerpts to come if you like this one.Interviewer: ""So tell me Mr. ___, how did you get here? I'm sure there's tons of work involved but you must have had an equal amount of support right? Who are these important people who have stood by you through thick and thin? And how did they help out?""Me: ""Haha, no need to be so formal. You can call me ____. I've got quite the controversial answer to your question. I don't mind sharing it because it is simply the truth. But the question is, how will the world react to it? I'm honestly very interested to find out. So are you ready?Interviewer: ""Absolutely, the floor is yours ____.""Me: ""Okay great! So on to the first controversial thing. I love crying and complaining about things. No matter where I am in life, rich or poor, important or irrelevant, In a relationship or heartbroken, it really doesn't matter. I will always find something to cry or complain about. However, what I've learnt through all my experiences is that you need to earn the right to cry. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? But it's true. Maybe you'll get a better idea of how I've incorporated that into my life while I answer the other parts of your question.""Interviewer: ""That is indeed quite an interesting opinion. Although, since it comes from you, I'm sure there's weight to it.""Me: ""Hmm (with a sly expression), unnecessary reassurance counts as flattery.""Interviewer: ""You got me there! Ahaha""Me: ""Alright, I'll answer the other part of your question now. The truth is, I've had minimal support throughout my life when it comes to quantity. What I mean is that the only people who have truly supported me are my amazing AMAZING parents and incredibly close relatives. Mainly just my parents tho. In fact, sometimes I've felt like it was us three against the world. Truly grateful that they were always by my side. This is quality support. Now on to the ugly side, I don't think I've ever really had good friendships while growing up. Everyone I had met and engaged with had been so selfish and self absorbed (including me ofc) that everything had always felt superficial. Yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and say that growing up, I had no friends. In fact, I was even bullied in highschool.""Interviewer: ""I like that you're going into detail ____ but are you really comfortable sharing all this?""Me: ""Oh I dont mind at all. The times have changed and people need to understand that if things need to go well in their life, you need the right balance of positivity and negativity. Just being positive will fetch you NOTHING, contrary to popular opinion. Likewise for being negative.""Interviewer: ""Please do enlighten us, Mr.___, the world thirsts for your wisdom.""Me: ""I will be ignoring that slight tone of condescension only because I've conquered the likes of you for years to be able to get here. You are beneath me and it's best if you know your place. Otherwise you are just gonna look stupid.""Interviewer: ""I deeply apologise ___, that was not my intention in the slightest (it absolutely was), please do continue (___ is right tho, I've got a lot to lose if this interview doesn't go well for me)""Me: ""Right, so where was I? Ah yes, friends. I often found it so weird that people thought I didn't deserve their support and oh man I've needed it so many times. For some reason, my so called 'Friends' were always there to console the other guys whenever they were in the slightest of distress. It could be the weirdest of shit. Someone must have called the other person a loser. And then it's just big drama and everyone rushes over to console them. Never was the case for me. For beginners, I was always the target of a joke or an insult in every group of friends I've been a part of. Something about me just happened to scream 'please take advantage of'. Then because of a bad day and pent up emotions, when I was actually affected by what they say, I was told to suck it up. Then, when I had real problems, people used to scoff and say 'I think you're just too dependent on others'. The very same people who used to cry about the littlest things, the very same ones who felt they were entitled to privileges that I don't deserve.Yes, I'm crying about it now. BUT I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT TO CRY. Where are they now even? Idek, because it's irrelevant. They're specks of dust now, consoling the other irrelevants of something inconsequential. The very same irrelevants, who made me question my personality time and time again. I used to overthink and lose my mind about this. And unlike what I've heard people say, something that goes like ""I have to thank these guys, it's because of their negativity that I am where I am today"", I strongly would like to say a big FUCK YOU to these guys. Oh they know who they are and what I'm talking about. If I had the right support,  my road to being where I am right now would have been a lot easier. But, nah fuck em. You might think this is incredibly petty of me, but you have to understand how much of an impact these people have had on my life. At a time, when I was easily influenced and strived to be liked, it almost destroyed me when I saw people who I called my friends look at me in contempt when I was need. But ofc, my strong negative emotions are absolutely balanced by the positive ones. I've kept my family close and provided them with all the privileges they deserve for sticking by me through thick and thin. It turns out that I just had the misfortune of meeting the worst sort of people while growing up and that genuine people do actually exist. I call some of these people 'true friends'. No they aren't the nicest people in the world, but they are original and loyal, something that can be easily reciprocated. There you go, cry and complain as much as you want. But get to the position where people think these complaints are 'opinions of change' rather than annoying instances. Show all who have wronged you, that you are far above. This is what I live by, and if I might say so, has gone extremely well for me.""";This is purely fictional but closely relates to current circumstances in my life.

1c4s0rh;Help!!!!!!;TinyTiger642;I've been diagnosed with MDD, GAD and panic disorder and I've also had chronic insomnia my entire life. My psychiatrist prescribed me Fluoxetine. My mum also has MDD and she's had an extremely positive experience with medication, and my dad basically only cares about himself so he wanted me to take the medication. Both parents were pressuring me really heavily to start it, even though I've told I'm in no way comfortable with it. I feel so shit 24/7 and have even more frequent panic attacks and breakdown/meltdown episodes. Honestly I feel really violated because I was basically given no choice to change the actual chemicals in my brain. I hate this medication so much but my parents keep on going on about how they think I'm better because that's what I've been telling them to keep them happy, when really it's obvious they have no idea.I have another psychiatrist appointment on Thursday, and plan to tell the doctor how much I hate it, but I don't know how to explain it to my parents so that they won't be angry and make me even more depressed.If anyone has any suggestions please please let me know I'm really desperate at this pointoh and also the doctor gave me melatonin for the insomnia, and my dad is going crazy to get me to take it because he's convinced I'm just 'going through a phase' and he blames it all on sleep. He essentially doesn't believe in mental health conditions. I also hate the melatonin as it makes me feel physically ill and gives me a feeling of my guard being down, which i really struggle with since my anxiety always has my guard up so I'm basically trapped.I'm extremely scared of any medication and I was bullied by my parents into taking both of these and I'm so desperate to stop them.Please if anyone knows how to deal with this sort of situation then please help meoh and also just need any support anyone is willing to give;I've been diagnosed with MDD, GAD and panic disorder and I've also had chronic insomnia my entire li;Need Support;1;1;2024-04-15 17:28:35;2024-04-15;Monday;17:28:35;1872;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:54.682949
1c4rs7r;After two years, I know I’m self sabotaging due to trauma and I can’t break out of the cycle;neongallifreyan;I am desperate for help, and I don’t know where to go. I am 23F, and two years ago lived in a very toxic household. My roommate at the time was emotionally and mentally abusive to me. On the night that I moved out, they took a positive social media post about me focusing on myself too seriously, and changed the locks on the house with my PC, all my clothes, and thousands worth of memorabilia, games consoles, my laptop, and other things still in the house. They then posted a long social media post indicating that I was a horrible person and all the bad things I had done while in the house.I was able to claw one friend back by showing her screenshots of the money I had sent for rent, as this had been omitted from the sorry the former HM had told people, but the entire situation left me badly shaken up and very upset. It’s been two years and I should be over it by now, but I have multiple friends that still hang out with my abuser very frequently, and because we live in a small city with an even smaller alternative community, it’s kind of impossible to avoid them. New friends I have made that don’t know any part of the situation have also started hanging around with them and I’m biting my tongue because if I speak I’ll be known as a drama starter and I feel it will backfire. I can’t really speak to my friends about it either, because it’s at the point where I feel they’re all sick and tired of hearing about the situation. Yesterday I saw photos from a mutual friend’s profile of my abuser engaging in a hobby that I have enjoyed for years, even though when we lived together they would actively discourage me from said hobby and make fun of the money I would put into it. It set me off really badly and I tried to vent about it to my close friend group, but very few of them responded and I instantly felt guilty for speaking. I’ve informed them that I’m not in a good place mentally right now and I’ve left all my groups chats and taken a social media break because I know looking at it is making it worse. I don’t know if this is my ADHD, anxiety, depression, I just have no idea. If someone can help me I’d really appreciate it;I am desperate for help, and I don’t know where to go.

The day before she broke up with me we was looking at holidays aboard together. We was planning our future and out of nowhere she’s telling me she just wants to do it alone, she left the same day turned off her location, told me to not call her. The last message I got from her was last night saying “I threw up and I’m in and out of sleep so goodnight”. Please bare in mind we have been great, the only thing I’ve noticed lately is she’s been going to the toilet with her phone way more than usual but that’s not uncommon for people so I didn’t think twice about it, I’d anything else was dodgy all she did was sit on a game on her phone for the past 3 days. I’ve really tried to talk to her about how she might feel and really listen to her express but she’s giving me nothing. All she can sat is “I don’t know”. She’s been living with me for 2 years all her clothes are here, she’s not paid rent once. I’ve always done everything for the better of us, the day before she broke up with me I paid off her debt to a klarna she said I used which I have zero memory off. I genuinely feel like my world is crashing around me, I’ve not felt this bad in so long. I’ve not slept in 3 days I’m having Micro naps and having nightmares about the situation, every single time I look at the phone I’m having a panic attack. I really don’t know what to do.

But whenever I'm trying to fall asleep and I'm exhausted I get this borderline feeling as if I'm falling into sleep paralysis, I keep having disturbing images and dream in a dream that is in another dream kind of thing, but I also realize that it's not real, my brain begins buzzing and i feel as if I'm slowly getting paralyzed, but can still prevent it. And all this is accompanied by the unableness to fall asleep, but also unableness to stay awake. Also quite a good amount of anxiety. And even the change of position doesn't help, I keep having this feeling for minutes on end. It happens rarely and is not related to the sleep pattern. I fall asleep quite early and sleep a good amount, wake up in the morning without trouble. It's not troubling me greatly, nor does it happen that often. But I never could find anyone who experienced something alike or had an explanation for such a thing. Maybe someone knows what it is and what can possibly cause it or even the official name for it?

If I'm particularly anxious, I'll repeat apologies over and over again. Even when told to stop apologizing, I reflexively apologize again. This habitual apology behavior makes me constantly reflect on my faults, even those that aren't mine, and often leads me to doubt myself.  3.Fear of seeking help:  Even in difficult situations, I find it hard to ask others for help and always bear everything alone.

The issue is, during most of this time, she has been quite 'mentally unstable' and even though I would like to help her, I feel it's affecting my academics. I really liked her but ever since our first month together she has had sudden ""attacks"" and many times and often has told me she was going to ""off herself"" (k1ll). I have always been for her and she told me no one else cares for her as I do, constantly saying she's alive because of me and even once she'd told me ""if you left, i would kms"" and I don't even know if she's actually serious or if she only doesn't want me leaving. There had been times I wanted to break up, but she instantly always says that she will ""throw herself under a car""and I really do not want anything bad to happen to herself. She constantly reminds me that she loves me, that she wishes to be my one and only forever, constantly askin if I got bored of her and if I still love her. Even though I'm not like that, her constant worry makes me feel bad, because I really liked her and was the one that started everything but she still doubts everything i give her. She is constantly stressed with everything, but with college I really don't think I can be her backbone anymore. Why does my first relationship has to be like this? Me and my friends were surprised the first time she aproached me, but now If I'm away too much time she cuts herself.

1c4pmtg;How do you help someone facing mental health issues;Imneeliax;The story is going to be a bit long but I really need help. There’s this girl that I am seeing. She was diagnosed with BPD, psychosis and depression since she was 15 and she just got re-diagnosed from psychosis to schizophrenia. She is 25 now. She had them due to her family and her past relationships. Her dad abuses her and she can’t get out of the situation. She is unable to cut off her father from her life. She had numeral attempts on suiciding and the last one was just a week ago. Everytime something gets too overwhelming for her, she tends to blackout and self harm. Since I met her, I have been treating her the best way possible and she admits it. I always try my best to make her happy and enjoy her days. I spoil her to my best without asking for anything in return. But i do have intentions on marrying her and would often say to her about it and remind her how much i love her.But the past few months, she had a lot of things going on in her life. Her father had abused her more, physically and verbally. She had people trying to mess with her at her workplace. Her ex which she is unable to move on from is back in her life. Everything just gets overwhelming for her and now she is asking for some time and space from me. Im doing my best to give her all the time and space that she needs. And she would be okay with it but sometimes it is still too overwhelming for her. Sometimes she would be very loving and clingy towards me but the next minute, she would push me away. She would always say things that would hurt me but i just try to push it away, thinking that its because of her BPD. P.S She has been to multiple therapist and it didnt help her.1. What do I do in this situation?2. How do I know whether she meant what she says or its just her BPD?3. How do i help her to get better?4. What do i do to calm her down when is overwhelmed?5.

1c4pfdh;How to deal with heartbreak?;Slow_Scholar7755;A bit lengthy post but please bear with it.....So about a month ago i met this girl on reddit, we started off commenting on a post and somehow the argument heated up and i ended up bashing her to submission. Later felt really bad and dm'd her apologising and she accepted. We're from different countries and different ethnicities but somehow we clicked and i was glad to find we had so many things in common. I surfed her profile and found a post regarding her past trauma and asked about her, she was reluctant at first but opened up to me little by little. Turns out she was SA'ed when she was a teen and was groomed and was physically and mentally abused multiple times. I assured her it wasn't her fault and no matter what other people say i still liked her. I was hinting that i would someday soon come and sweep her off of her feet and give her a better life 😅 but she insisted that it may take time to get out of the toxic headspace she's in right now and i assured her i was willing to wait. She seemed happy and i was happy that she was happy.Fast forward 2 days ago i became worried as i haven't heard from her for 3 days when she's usually the one that texts me. So i texted her and asked if anything happened, she said yes something major happened and didn't want to open up at first because she thought i would leave her but i assured her that won't happen. Then she dropped the bomb......she didn't disclose all her past trauma to me and was hiding something even more hideous......turns out the guy that SA'ed her recorded that event and threatend to release it if she doesn't comply and had been physically abusing her for a long time. 2 days ago that guy got out of control and physically assaulted her as well. I tried to remain calm and supported her through the texts, but when i went to bed all the repressed emotions came rushing in. The feeling of helplessness, betrayal and heartache strated to eat me alive, even now when i'm writing this post i'm feeling a poisonous thorn in my heart that just won't go away......I don't blame her for not opening up about her past, she was right to hide it from me, but over the past few weeks i've developed strong feelings towards her and i've never felt like this towards any other women. It would've been much easier to move on if i didn't have feelings for her and she also said she would understand if i were to severe the friendship, but she has no friend in real life and it would tear me apart to just cut my loses and run. But i also can't get rid of this feeling that my first love would end in such a way and i would never be able to be with her........ So, now for the real question, do i stay in contact with her or do i say goodbye? The fact that she may see this post is also haunting me but right now i have no one to talk to so i'm taking the chance.....P.S. - I used to laugh at guys who said they were going through a heartbreak but never could've imagined it was so inexplicably painful, guess the jokes on me now.....;A bit lengthy post but please bear with it.....So about a month ago i met this girl on reddit, we st;Content Warning: Sexual Assault;2;2;2024-04-15 15:43:45;2024-04-15;Monday;15:43:45;3000;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:54.746688
1c4pb6r;What can I do so that way someone can give me a chance?;Automatic-Glass-6112;Tw: brief mention of drugsSo, in all my life, no one has ever given me a chance. Whether that be with friendship or relationship. No one had ever given me the time of day. Therefore, it has to be my fault. If not a single person has ever cared, then it's my fault. I'm doing something wrong. And I have no clue what I can do to change that. I'm not physically attractive, I don't have much money, and I can't provide much for anyone. Those are seemingly the only 3 things people look for in a person that they want to be around. I have no inherent value. Even if I had one of those qualities, what makes me deserve love/care? If I haven't had it once in my entire existence, then it's pretty safe to say that I don't deserve it. However, I would do absolutely just to experience love one time before I'm dead. And I don't know how much longer that will be. I just want to know what it's like to be loved. One time. Just once. Truly loved. But I don't deserve it. I dont deserve any of this. I can't provide anything. Everyone expects more of me than I can do. I try as hard as I can but it's never enough for anyone. My escape from all of this is drugs. I get high to empty my mind and be happy. This is the only closure I get anymore. I have no one to do it with. I have no one to support me. No one to care about me. So I fall back to drugs. Just weed and shrooms, but it's still not good for me. Nothing that could kill me outright, but not something that I want 24/7. I know it's not good but I'm trying to get out of the habit. I only do it when I'm alone and very rarely does anyone see me in that state.I hide all of my negative emotions from people. I try and avoid talking about them as much as possible. Because every single time I've ever talked about them, that person I talked to has left my life, and I never see them again. So I've just resorted to bottling. I would go back to therapy, but I don't have enough money. I would get antidepressants, but getting the prescription and them themselves is also expensive, and I barely can afford to eat. I would have to make a choice between eating or antidepressants. I just need something. Someone. Anything. Some kind of support of some kind. But no, I don't get any of that. Why? I don't know. I just know that I'm not enough to deserve any of it. I just know that nothing I do has ever been enough or ever will be enough. I just know that for as long as I'm alive, this is going to persist.;Tw: brief mention of drugsSo, in all my life, no one has ever given me a chance.

She does so much for me and I don't deserve her. I hate who I am. A couple months ago I was constantly running away, my mom told me she still has nightmares of me running away. I also snitched on her (which I feel insanely bad for) I told a teacher that she'd push me down the stairs, hit me in the head over and over, I told the teacher her boyfriend would throw me, kick me etc.  I did it for selfish reasons, I kept getting nightmares of what she did and it made me want to end myself, got to a point where I wouldn't hide the bruises anymore just to see if anyone would notice, they did only twice and when they asked what happened I just shrugged. Again, I feel so bad for everything I did, I took it all back, I said I lied, my mum said I lied, so did my dad and brothers, so it truly looks like I'm a liar, I don't like that of course, but it's for the best. Thing is I didn't just go out spouting that shit, she asked, she asked what was wrong because I was upset, she asked.What I hate though, is my mum told people I liked Hitler, she said I loved how he manipulated people and that he was my idol. That was never true.  I understand that I'm a manipulative narcissist, but I don't know how to stop. At the hospital according to my dad a nurse told him she could 'see evil in me' I'm not sure what I did to have that said, and my mum told me in the hospital, the nurses said, 'she's pushing buttons isn't she?' when they saw that on my records it says I claim she hit me? Something like that. (Again I took it all back so I don't know why that's there)  I hate myself for snitching, I hate myself for drinking, I don't deserve my mother. Like she said, I just was too horrible for too long, she couldn't help but react.

1c4otpw;I have experienced several traumatic events, and I think they are catching up with me;Diligent-Ebb-9911;"Please note this is a temporary account.  Please forgive the info dump  I am not asking for medical advice, rather guidance & support. I understand that anything shared here is not an evaluation from a professional.I have never sought professional help, I have confided components to caring friends, and on the whole I have managed to live decent life: I am engaged to a wonderful, patient, and caring woman (who is aware of everything), I have a decent job, I am nearly finished my PhD, and I have managed to publish some decent research papers and even teach a few university classes. I also work for the military part-time, but I have never been in combat. I suppose I am trying to make it clear that I have, thus far, managed. With respect to 'traumatic events' (whatever that means to someone), the major ones were: I was sexually abused and groomed by a direct family member from around 6-8 years old, a different direct family member has also tried to initiate sexual acts (unsuccessfully) a few times at various ages (~15-24), my childhood home burned down while I was inside (everyone, except my pets, got out safely), and most recently my partner and I moved to a new town, where about three days ago, a man in a hospital gown was scoping out our home by shining lights into all our windows, broke into the vacant unit next to us, and punched and kicked a hole through the drywall to climb through to our bedroom closet, at which point I intervened (use your imagination, but please know that everyone, including the invader, is safe). Here are some minor ones, or maybe not minor, but less direct: My mother has attempted suicide a few times, once by pills, another time by jumping out of the car while our father was driving on the highway (I was also in the car). At around 11 I discovered my parents would regularly swing with my best friend's parents (I found lots of photos). A good friend, no, an amazing friend, and his partner died in a car crash a few months after our high school graduation (we are a small town, and it was particularly biting). My father was in a car crash when I was very young, it was very serious (several resection surgeries, and bonus flesh eating virus). My 'kid's room' was in the basement, and flooded several times, often while I was asleep, with up to two feet of water, and ruining most of my belongings. And what, has always seemed to be to me, your typical physical and verbal abuse growing up. There's more, but I am just trying to highlight what I think are supposed to be the primary issues, or what others have told me are supposed to be issues. Everything now seems to have built up where compartmentalization is no longer the working trick. Sometimes it feels like I have constant anxiety; my cheeks take the brunt of this. I had a panic attack for the first time, although thankfully it seems to have been an isolated episode. If I smell fire or see flashes of flame, I will sometimes have a sudden rush of panic. At night, certain sounds will immediately rouse me from my sleep, and I will be fully alert and must investigate -- this behavior has more than doubled since the home invasion. I seem to have a weird form of empathy, I almost always need to use logic to understand someone's feelings, and typically I have rote and practiced responses to provide so I don't look heartless. However, if I'm teaching or helping someone, I seem to have a more genuine and caring demeanor. Whenever there is a group conversation, I feel the need to maintain and balance the group interaction (I have been told this is weird). I sometimes have emotional outbursts over very silly or minor things, and I immediately realize my overreaction, but I hate that feeling of regret. Only a few years ago (about the time I started graduate school), I began to get bouts of psoriasis, it is fairly minor, but I don't enjoy it, and it seems to be correlated with peaking anxiety. I'm sure there's more, but this post is approaching an unfavorable length, and I think most of the major details are out in the open. I just want to be a healthier person, especially for my future wife and children, and of course, for myself.

1c4o273;I want to die so this confusion in my head will be finally over;unnamed_op2;"I have A LOT of problems since always. Troubled life, not only childhood, but mainly childhood, but all my life has been very messy. Lot of traumas. Lot of regrets. I'm also genetically fucked up, and this fucks up my head and bring a lot of mental issues.    What I have: Anxiety and severe depression for sure. Probably OCD. Maybe a bunch of other things as well.    So, there's this thing. There's this person. She's perfect and the best so please do not say anything bad about her. But in 2018 she said some things that were triggers for me. Since then some things have been said and happened that were like triggers scattered throughout the years. But the main ones occurred in 2018 and 2019. Those triggers are related to a main thing, which I will refer to as ""blue"" from now on.    I never ever liked blue, I was pretty sure I did not want blue in my life at all. But then with all those things related to blue being said/happening, something slightly changed in 2019, because I thought about blue in a different way but in two occasions for a few minutes only. Then, skip to 2021. I had a lot going on, living alone, fucking depressed, angry, and I was like ""you know what? I'm gonna search on the internet about blue"" Idk why, I think I wanted to hurt me emotionally but Idk why. And then BAM! I discovered a FUCKING NEW ENTIRE WORLD EXISTS, the signs, the names, the stuff...    Since then I've been reading/watching/learning about blue every time I have a free time, it's taking over control of my life. In 2021 I still was tricking my mind that I was seeing things related to blue just for a different reason, that I did not want blue in my life. I was just lying to myself. Things started to slowly change in 2022, then in 2023 it took control and I was all for blue. But sometimes I'm reluctant.    And now it is fucking ruining my life. I don't know if she really wants blue or if I misinterpreted. But why did she say all those things? fuck my life. I'm going insane.    Aftermath: I want to kms so this mess in my head will stop. This is not the only reason I'm currently suicidal, but this thing is taking. a HUGE toll on me.    People who do blue of course encourage this. But when I read normal (i.e. vanilla) people talking about this, they're disgusted. Actually even people who do blue say this may have bad results. IDK WHAT TO DO. I CRY EVERYDAY AND THINK OF BLUE ALL THE TIME. I even started to hit my hands/arms every time I have a thought like this so this can stop, but I got to the point I started to get bruises, and sometimes my hands and arms are really sore.    I really wish I could go back in time when I didn't know this was a thing.    I am not saying this is this person fault. Please do not say anything bad about her, she is perfect.

1c4nu4w;I need support, my anxiety is killing me;Martinodegard;I just started a relationship with a girl and she told me about her ex boyfriend that’s crazy and always trying to contact her to “fix things”. That stupid thing is making so anxious and insecure that she could get in any moment back together with him, last night I told her that I can’t believe anything that she told me because if it’s your ex and he stills calling you and texting you to fix the relationship and you don’t block him, it doesn’t making any fucking sense to me, she told me that yeah in fact it was her fault to let him still talk to her and she proceed to block him in everything and showed me, but idk why it was not enough for my thoughts that are killing me rn. Later that day we were talking in WhatsApp and she would say that she was going to sleep so we basically finished the conversation there, then I logged into Instagram and she was online after and hour, again my fucking head making me think things like she’s talking to other dude or cheating on me, I really want to trust her because I think a relationship has to be build through trust right? But I keep overthinking over and over till the point I don’t want to get up of my bed, I’m not hungry and I don’t even wanna shower, and I guess it’s because I’m fucking sad thinking she would leave for other dude :(;I just started a relationship with a girl and she told me about her ex boyfriend that’s crazy and al;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-15 14:38:01;2024-04-15;Monday;14:38:01;1294;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:53.440375

1c4n51j;I’ve felt like this for a while and would like it too change ;Due-Daikon-5018;I constantly feel like a bad person and don’t know what to do I’m making this post because I think I’m hoping for some sort of reassurance that I’m not a bad person . I’m going to try my best to explain how I feel so sorry if it doesn’t always make sense . I feel like I’m a horrible person who is always pretending to be something I’m not .even tho i know the way i act is true to myself somehow I always end up feeling like im lying. For example after a good day out with a girl for example I always come home and feel horrible that it went well. I feel like I’ve somehow lied to this girl and that she’s fallen for someone who im not , when the whole day I felt like I was speaking from a genuine place and actually had a really great time ,maybe some sort of self sabotage im not sure.  Another issue I gave is making myself stressed by just giving myself reasons to hate myself .like again if im out on a walk on my own maybe listening to music because I’ve been in the house all day , I’ll get home feeling guilty about this walk and then when talking to my mum after and she asks where I go I feel like im lying when I tell her the truth of the route I took even tho it’s only round the neighbour hood as if im lying or something and actually went to get weed im not sure what I think I’ve done , the most recent example of this. Which has prompt led me to reach out is that I got with this girl at a party and we ended up getting intimate , not quite as far as sex but further than just making out , for some reason even tho I checked for consent frequently during and before what we did and asked if she was okay and we’ve talked since and she said she enjoyed it , and again got acknowledgement that I did check for consent and if she okay a lot I for some reason after this feel like a rapist or something, that I’ve done something horrible to this person when I’m reality it was a consensual and nice experience for us both . I have the image on my head of going into classes after the weekend and getting people staring at me and me being labelled a rapist, and a very heavy feeling n my chest like a constant state of worry . What is wrong with me why do I feel like this and how can I get help or find out what’s wrong with me if anyone has any similar feelings and may know it would be appreciated as I am tired of feeling like I’m the worst and that I’m a constant liar at and that everything I do is crime . It’s a horrible feeling and have felt shitty and bad for days and have even apologised for anything to the girl who has said that it’s unnecessary as I haven’t done anything wrong it’s getting to the point where I am feeling suicidal from constantly feeling completely and utterly shit and like a disappointment to my parents for what I’ve done but haven’t actually done;I constantly feel like a bad person and don’t know what to do I’m making this post because I think I;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-15 14:08:18;2024-04-15;Monday;14:08:18;2796;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:53.443047

1c4mzvd;Obsession and trust issues over someone i just talked to online;AKBIROCK;So i knew a girl just online and talked to her for just two months. We are talking daily. The issue here is that i guess im obsessed here with her. And i want her to talk to me all the time and i keep checking her followers on every platform in case she has some new guy she talks to. Even tho i find nothing but i keep on doing that. Now in addition to that due to my last relationship i guess or to my nature i developed trust issues. So whenever she is away for so long or she’s late on replying i start making scenarios about how she may be talking to multiple people at the same time. I swear to god i hate that. I don’t want to feel that way. But i can’t stop thinking about every possibility. I tried and blocked her before and go away to stop myself from that (that’s how i usually fix anything with people i just cut them off) yet i texted her the next day. I had like withdrawals from not talking to her lol. These type of feeling just come and goes. Sometime i stop caring at all sometimes it returns in an amplified way. I know that this is not love.

1c4mqpu;I am lonely and I can't make friends ;ScarlettLaVey;I thought things would get better, I was in therapy in a clinic that has a great reputation and I felt like it helped a lot. I moved away from home and it was awesome, I started uni in a new city and I joined the student council. I felt like I was finally finding my way into a normal life after all the trauma and sadness. Then I noticed how people took pictures on every event and even though I told them to please stop taking pictures with me because it makes me uncomfortable, they didn't. I needed to grab there phones and delete the pictures because they wouldn't do it after I asked them nicely and explain. I talked about it to one girl I befriended, she just said I shouldn't go out with people then if I don't like that. It made me feel so sad. She stopped talking to me after, she did things like inviting everyone to come cooking with her except me or telling other people how I refused to do student council work (which has never happened). Last Friday there was a party for all new students hosted by our council, I told the people in our group chat that I was on my way. Immediately I received the messaged that there would be lots of photos and they can't look out for me. Even though one guy said they can try to, it decided not to go because I felt like they didn't care. I have an issue with photographs because I was bullied throughout my entire time in school, people took pictures of me and edited them and forced me into group chats telling me how disgusting I am. I know it's a me-problem, I just thought the other member would care a little at least until I've worked through it in therapy. I feel so lonely. I thought I had friends. I thought things would get better. The last time I harmed myself was years ago, I am struggling to keep myself away from it for the first time again. I am sitting at home, crying, all I can think about is how much of a fool I was to think it would ever get better. My best friend thinks I will find my group eventually, I just have a lot on my plate and I need to find people who can deal with it. But I think I am just not made for this.

1c4mkwu;I feel my existence has no purpose;usere6020;Hi People,I have been feeling very sad recently and I could really use some support. I am 24 (M) and I am currently staying in an Airbnb basement room in Toronto, Canada. For the past two years, I've been tirelessly searching for stable work since I graduated with a diploma in Broadcasting TV and Film. Unfortunately, I've only been able to land freelance projects, which do not cover my basic expenses like rent, food, phone bills, and transportation.Thankfully I have a family in my home country that supports me. However I am tired of asking them for money to live in this expensive country and I feel like a loser everyday, not showing any positive results.I apply to at least 15 jobs a day, and I get no response. My old clients don't contact me, (they don't have any projects). I am also contacting people on LinkedIn for career chat, thankfully I will have an in person meeting with an industry professional today, I am looking forward to that. My bank account in my home country got blocked and I cannot pay for a therapist. I only have about $200 dollars in my Canadian bank account to pay for food and bus tickets. I am tired of this situation. I apply everyday and I get no responses. I feel like I am worthless and I have no purpose in this world. I really want to get some help but I cannot afford it at the moment because I can only use the $200 dollars to survive here. I have a girlfriend and I feel I disappoint her for being unemployed and not a productive member of society. On top of everything, the living situation in my Airbnb is far from ideal. I also have misophonia and I feel uncomfortable where I am staying because my roommates are loud and inconsiderate, adding to my stress and discomfort. It's hard to find peace and focus in such an environment.I think sometimes I suffer from derealization disorder. I think the world around me is not real, like I am watching a screen. I feel emotionally empty sometimes.Ideally I would not have to be here. I would prefer to be in my home country with my own business. But the film and tv industry is not appreciated there. I have been contemplating going back to college and study something else that is in demand like computer science or web development. I just want to earn money, have my own place and not be a disappointment to my parents so much.Thank you for taking your time to read this message.;Hi People,I have been feeling very sad recently and I could really use some support.

1c4lmro;I wish I could stop caring what other people think;tiredtetetragona;The weirdest thing is, I'm agoraphobic and haven't spoken to anyone that isn't my mother, siblings or grandmother in years so what reason do I have to care? Nobody even knows I exist to begin with. I really envy people like my mother, she absolutely rocks whatever she wants and until very recently, was even dying her hair different colors and is very highly regarded and well-loved in her workplace because of her laid-back, non-judgemental and fun attitude. She doesn't even hide her interests or anything and I've even recently gotten her into fallout. It kinda dawned on me how much I actually care what people think of me when we were watching a medical show and the topic of piercings came up. I let slip that I'd like to have either snake or spider bite piercings as I think they look cool and she fully encouraged that, even telling me of the piercings she used to have many years ago. I looked into it after, saw how negatively those things are usually received at the very least online and got very self-conscious about even having had the thought. I wish I could just throw a paper bag over my head and do whatever I want beneath it, ya know?

Whenever I try to hold a job, I end up having a panic attack so severe that I end up having to quit because I just don't come back, for fear of getting let go or the panic attack repeating the next day.I can't even make it to interviews. I just recently had to cancel an interview, because an hour beforehand I had such a bad panic attack that I was screaming and sobbing. This happens outside of interviews as well, on the rare occasions that I pull through and get the job. I've ""ran away"" from jobs in the past during panic attacks. I do have a therapist but she's basically given up on me and does not help me with this issue. I don't know what to do. I've been on medicine in the past as well, but it didn't help. My parents are giving up on me as well, and if I don't get a job soon, I'm afraid they're going to kick me out. This entire ordeal has been happening for multiple years. I'm scared I'm just going to end up homeless one day.If anyone has any tips or advice on overcoming this extreme anxiety I have, that would be great.";I'm 18 and I've never been able to hold a job.

1c4lj3v;It’s a long one - Changes in medication. Is it mania?;BecOnTheMove;It’s a long one - Changes in medication. Is it mania?I’ve been on about 10 medications over the years for major depression and anxiety. Over the last few years I realise I developed a bad habit of med switching. I have a bad habit over the years of messing with my meds. 1. Stopped all my meds against the advice of my Psychiatrist and ended up crashing HARD. Won’t do that again that’s for sure!2. Start a med and after a while decide it’s not working and either: Decide to adjust my dose either up or down: Decide it’s not working at all and get the Psych to change to something elseRecent swap:Last year I said nothing was working and I want to try Effexor again because that was ok the first time I used it (2012). This is the third time on Effexor. I started in November and I’m on 225mg. First thing I noticed was when I wake up in the morning after having Largactil at night to sleep, I would be so drowsy all morning and sometimes a headache. Prior to the Effexor, Largactil was the 1st medication that I had been prescribed for my insomnia that didn’t cause daytime fatigue. Also after starting Effexor I began playing with my eyelashes. This is something I have done since childhood as a comfort. It had actually stopped with the other medication but didn’t realise till I started doing it again. It is compulsive. I was doing it so much, constantly all the time, it has got to the point I get conjunctivitis like symptoms of gross yellow stuff sticking in my eyes and all around my eyeline is red, swollen and painful. It requires drops and some cream on the skin. Since starting again I also ended up in a severe depressive state which would leave me motionless in bed not moving, staring at nothing with racing thoughts in my head the felt like they were so loud. After months of this I finally went to the Psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with Bipolar II.Problem:I want to come off the Effexor and go back on something else. I’m feeling like a Prozac is better. I have start with a new Psych as mine retired. I haven’t done this with him. While he has discussed with me and my original Psych about my history of symptoms and medications in order to confirm Bipolar II, he has only recently started me on Lamotrigine. I don’t know how to tell him I don’t want the Effexor. I need some outside input to sort through what I’m thinking and what/how to say it. 🙏;It’s a long one - Changes in medication.

1c4lhcg;Sertraline;laydeelou;Hi all. I am looking for some advice perhaps? I started sertraline 50mg 4 days ago. Initially night time but didn’t sleep so switched it to morning. I have found that the last 2 days I’ve been constantly yawning and feeling like I can’t take a deep breath. Like I really have to concentrate on my breathing and focus on it to be able to take that deep breath. I’m still not sleeping well so the yawning could be tiredness even though I don’t feel tired, I feel absolutely wired, sort of like I’m on drugs. I’ve still been able to go to the gym and walk the dog etc so it’s not a shortness of breath, but when I’m sat still that’s when it catches me. Has anybody else experienced this and is it a symptom that will go away,I’ve tried looking online and can’t see much about it in the side effects. Thankyou in advance;Hi all.

I won a court hearing that said basically ""you're mentally stable enough to live on your own and take care of yourself"", which honestly isn't true. but i don't believe being stuck in places like that was ideal. i believe I need disability i guess. but i have been denied several times in the past. i just wish i had a way of having money and possibly doing a little traveling, but im kind of stuck here with my mother. i hardly get out of the house. i hardly have motivation to do anything. but i don't particularly want to unalive myself. it's just like, being stuck. i want to live a little more than i am, y'know? im just getting sick of having a shitty life. i want to discover more. thank you for reading if you made it this far! ♡";well, here is my first ever reddit post. interesting place for it to be a first post in my opinion. ;Venting;0;1;2024-04-15 12:16:56;2024-04-15;Monday;12:16:56;1879;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:53.498917

How am I supposed to do anything? People keep recommending meditation but thinking and breathing go hand in hand. I can't exist without thinking. I swear my head will explode.The only time I can stop thinking is when I'm asleep. I can't be concious and not think.I can't seem to focus on my studies. I'm honestly interested in so many things that I keep on going back and forth like a pendulum, unable to give full dedication to any of the tasks. I like writing but I can't seem to go beyond one sentence. When I tried to do journaling, I always had to cut the sentences halfway because I remember to add sth else. And when the page became full of cut and messy sentences, I'd have to give up since I can't bear the look of the page. I tried to write stories but no matter how many videos I watch to hear people telling me that the first draft doesn't have to be perfect, I just can't continue if I can't fix the previous sentence. With English being my second language adds acid to my already bubbling frustration. I used to like maths until I joined the new school (for 11th and 12th), I couldn't keep up with the teaching pace. My teacher was so fast and wouldn't go into details. While I'm used to thinking a lot and do things step by step. It's a habit I can't get rid of. I feel like I'll never be able to study higher maths because there's no place for slow and lazy people. Yet I try to give time and learn my own way but there's physics, then chem, then bio. So where's the time? I can't manage all of them. I love reading novels but refraining myself from them since I feel guilty to enjoy a story when I've a pile of academic books crushing me under their weight and a bunch of due exams pulling my nerves  (idk what to study so I'm giving all sorts of entrance exams). And the current political climate of my country is really so fucking bad. I can't see this rampant inequality, oppression and discrimination.But I'm hopeless. I don't even know how to quickly read an analogue watch. I have to look at it for more than a minute since it's so hard to adjust the hands in my head then count by 5 mins until I can finally be sure of it. It's so embarrassing. Idk why I'm so concious of every step. If these aren't e-fucking-nough, my childhood SA memories come all the way to grab by my throat. And I end up imagining about all the possible ways I should've've spoken up for myself and thrown him into jail or see myself rescued by a saviour. Then there are my child abusing neighbours who'll hideously slap and beat their children and I can't do anything to save them (I see myself in them).

1c4k1dn;URGENT HELP NEEDED!!;Echo_Enchantress;I’m going through a really tough breakup. Six years ago, I matched with a guy on Tinder who was serving in the military. We never actually met or had lengthy conversations. After two years of no contact, he suddenly reached out to me. Despite my initial reluctance, he persuaded me to meet him. When we finally met, he seemed genuinely interested in me and even brought up the topic of marriage. We quickly involved our families, and everything felt like true love to me, despite my lack of experience in such matters. After a few days, his anger issues began to surface. He would clench his teeth in anger, break things, and attribute it to frustration and negative conversations. He constantly reassured me that everything could be resolved and that he would never leave me, until one day he abruptly decided to leave and started ignoring me. Each time we spoke, he expressed his desire to be with me. I never imagined he would cause me so much pain. For about a month, he claimed he wanted to work on our issues but then would ignore me, lie to me, and mistreat me. Despite this, I held onto hope that things would improve, as he never mentioned leaving me. One day, I urgently requested to speak with him, expressing my frustration with his promises followed by ignorance. He admitted he couldn't continue and suggested we be friends. I was shocked, considering we had been discussing marriage. I pleaded with him not to say such things. He mentioned wanting to sleep and promised to call me the next day, but he never did. Since then, he hasn't reached out or responded to any of my messages. It's been three months now, and my emotional state hasn't improved. My mother, witnessing my suffering, attempted to reach out to him on my behalf. Although he returned her call, he failed to follow through on his promise to speak with me.

1c4jxia;Can I take clonazepam a couple of hours before my exams?;Ambitious-Cake-;I generally take clonazepam a couple of hours before exams. 1-2 mg. I've been doing it since an year. It did work for a couple of exams fantastically last year. But this time, I feel a bit disoriented in the exam hall. I'm not sleepy or drowsy but I just don't know what I'm doing and how to structure my answers. I end up submitting incomplete papers and mixing up concepts I know really well. I'm not sure whether this has anything to do with on the spot anxiety or the pill. I won't deny that for the exams that went well, I'd pre drafted the answers and put in more structured efforts. In today's exam, I'd studied the concepts extremely well and had my notes before hand. But I just didn't know what to write because I got so confused and felt stuck. Also, I've been attempting exams only after 2 years. I have been skipping all my exams since the past two years because of profound anxiety. It's just that, even if I've taken clonazepam the precious night or day, my heart doesn't stop pounding on the day of the exam. I genuinely don't know what to do. I'm not sure whether all of this is attributed to clonazepam or whether I'm getting the hang of writing exams at University or whether I'm just downright non functional anxious.;I generally take clonazepam a couple of hours before exams. 1-2 mg.

Ive been thinking I may be autistic for years and at the weekend I had a huge meltdown because an activity I was doing didn't go to plan and my timings for the day got messed up and the day was ruined. I also spent too much at my food shop and that upset me too. Literally just non stop crying tbh. I felt exhausted after the meltdown and still feel drained. I went to work this morning and all I did for 2 hours was stare at my computer and cry quietly. All the noise and people at the office was feeling really intense and i was panicking. I went to the toilet 3 times to have a proper big cry. Ended up speaking to my boss who is really kind and said I could go and work from home (which is where I am now and I do feel better). He said I don't need to feel embarrassed or bad about it but I can't help feeling like I'm weak and I can't even pretend to be normal. I am constantly putting up a facade and pretending to be like everyone else, juggling a million and one things and doing fine. Until I'm not.

Lifting microwaves, tvs, etc. while timed to get to people in a few minutes has been crazy and I have been burnt out.I am tired and exhausted and feel I lost all hope. I live with my girlfriend and her dad and it's the most embarrassing thing ever. I never have woke up so tired and mustering zyns and caffeine to get me by my day.I wish I could reach out to family but I don't want to. The biggest reason is because I feel whenever they are included all independence is wiped.It's not to the point of mom's being mom's and dad's being dad's. It's the point of I'm 21 years old (turning 22) and worked hard as hell through high school with them always against me. They always played a huge game of favoritism especially felt it when they refused to help me out for school but handed it all to my brother.My mom even told me when through the roughest of times ""I don't know how I can continue to love you"" over the fact that I was upset that we moved states in short notice and didn't get to send the goodbyes to my best of friends I made in my first 14 years being a live.I am blessed I am a hard worker and still fight everyday for myself and my girlfriend to better ourselves and get us into a better situation.But fuck this process is so draining and I feel so lost on what to do. I can't get up with barely any assistance but dammit in this economy no where close to being able to take a break. Just the other day I went through a cycle of hell because I wanted to hurt myself badly for the first time in a long time.I'm glad I have somewhat of a support system but god any words of encouragement or advice.

1c4j4js;I need advice please;Clup101;"I'm not really sure how to word this at all, I'm not sure what advice I'm looking for but I need a least someone to hear me. I have been raped by my older siblings dad, and still remember what happened. I won't talk about it much, but he used my mouth for he's own sick pleasure. Idk if that counts as rape (I'm saying this because others have told me it doesn't). I have been touched without my concent for a total of 4 times all when I was younger. some where in school, some where out when I was being babysat. I'm now a sophomore in highschool, everything hasn't been okay at all since that all has happened.I have told my mother, and my older sibling, and my aunt and my cousin, all about this. I told my mother and older sibling this twice. The first time, I don't think they heard me, or perhaps I was dreaming, I don't really remember now. But the second time I told them, I was hurting, by just remembering it all again. My mother told me, she couldn't do anything about it. She told me I couldn't get therapy, even though I think I do now. She told me she would go to jail, if she said anything. I still don't understand why, I know I can't tell the school shit. And even if I want to go to a therapist, I don't have money, and I doubt my mother will help me.She had told me that she was also raped, but she didn't get to go to therapy either so why should I? (Not her words, but it felt like that's what she was telling me) she tells me I need to be strong. But in all honesty, I am not. Not at all. I'm just merely trying to live for as long as possible, even if there's nothing worth living for.And for my older sibling, I don't think she remembers the conversation we had anymore, and it isn't her fault. I won't explain my older siblings condition since I don't feel comfortable doing that. But when she did know, she would still talk and go to her dad's house. I don't know what I was expecting, I guess I was hoping she would stop talking to him?? I was hoping with this ""new"" information they all would be mad at him, that's the least they could do for what that man did to me. But they didn't. They continued on, like nothing was wrong.So. I had to stay in the car, stay in the bathroom, stay in my room until that man was gone, because I was so fuckin disgusted whenever I heard he's voice. I was disgusted when my older sibling gave me some soda that her dad brought for her, so she gave it to me.One time a month later after the talk. My mother and I had to attend a school meeting. (Because I was still a freshman and I wasn't going to school at all. I have a lot of trouble with going to school, and I don't know why.. but we will discuss that topic another time.) In the meeting one of the ladies noticed something about me that made her ask me. ""Do you have trouble taking showers?"". I said yes, because I do. She then asked ""Do you feel like you absolutely can go to school but whenever you try and actually go, you just can't?"" And I said yes.I was shocked how she understood that feeling. And then she asked if I was ever raped. Now in this whole time, my mother was answering my questions for me in which got the lady mad or more so annoyed, so when she asked that question, she told my mom not to answer that for me. And to my mom's disappointed, I  said yes.The room got quiet, and they went on to question me, talking me outside to talk with a male teacher. In the end. It was all useless. I said what happened, I answered all their questions, and they couldn't give me the closure or answers to my questions. And I left with my mom. In the car, I was almost ready to burst in tears, staring at the floor just blankly.Here are some things I have questions about, considering this topic. Is this actually hurting me mentally? (I know that at one point something inside me snap that was related to the rape and that's when I stopped taking care of my hygiene)What is wrong with me? How can I stop remembering this?  How can I heal?  What can I do?This is one of the topics I wanted to talk about.

I have been seeing the same therapist for over 4 years and he really helped in the beginning but I’m thinking it might be time to part ways. I feel as if sometimes he gives me almost a “free pass” for certain behaviour, because of previous experiences and trauma but I want to be held accountable. Yes there are reasons but it’s not an excuse. I have been offered so many wonderful opportunities and it is killing me that I am so down all the time I’m not even appreciating and making the most of what I do have.

1c4iasv;please help me;Abject-Nectarine5276;"Hello. I am making this post because my mental health is at an all time low and I need any help I can get right now, whether its just listening, sympathizing or helping me, I will appreciate it.About me: I am a 14 year old Australian male who is in the second term (10 weeks of school) of year 10. I have a small job in which I work about 10 hours a week and I also run a clothing brand in which I hope to grow into my main source of income. (haven't made any sales yet)My problem: I am, and have been for a few months now, at an all time low. I am never happy about anything, I get aggravated very easily, i have minimum of three restless nights per week, a 2 week holiday just ended and I left my room less times than the amount of fingers on my hands, and I am slowly concluding towards the solution being suicide. I truly think that if I wasn't scared of the pain, I would've done it by now.I don't even know where to start. My social life is a mess. I have been hanging out with the same group of about 4 people for most of the duration of high school. (about 3 years) At one point, I saw them as my best friends, but slowly overtime I came to realize that they are dropkicks. They are everything I don't want to be. They don't leave their game consoles unless its to hit the vape shop or smoke cones. I have tried vaping, weed and cigarettes and I consistently vaped for about a year and smoked weed for about 3 months until I went all healthy. ( ill get into this later) This is what made me realize they weren't the right people for me. I saw myself as superior to them just because I had the ability to quit drugs before they even had the idea of it. I slowly started hating them more and more every day but never actually showed it, or left them for a new group of friends. Then one day, out of the blue, they all ditched me. This happened about 3 weeks before the holidays so about 6 weeks ago. We all used to sit at the basketball courts along with about 200 other students every lunch time/recess. Now without them, I am the only one sitting by myself. I know people see me as a loner, or a loser now and obviously I don't like it. It makes me quite insecure but I choose to do nothing about it. I don't sit with someone else, I don't make new friends, I just sit all alone every recess for everyday. I had a girlfriend. I have had multiple in the past but they weren't real relationships. We would text each other but completely avoid each other at all cost irl. But this girl, ill called her EL, was the first girl I actually spoke too whilst dating. We went on multiple dates, and we were each others first kiss. I think I might have commitment issues or something because as soon as EL mentioned our anniversary, I started to subconsciously point out every little flaw about her and made up my mind to break up with her. About 1 week later, I deeply regretted it, realizing I literally searched for a reason to break up with her.  What the fuck is wrong with me? I miss her, and think about her every late night but don't text her because she moved on and got a new boyfriend really fast. My health is pretty bad right now. I got caught vaping once and my mum searched my room and found weed. My parents are divorced btw. She said she wouldn't tell my dad since he is already on my back about the vaping and all this happening really showed me that I was on the path to being a disappointment. So I stopped everything drug related, cut out social media, and refined sugars from my diet and went to gym for 2 hours a day, 6 days a week. My diet was the hardest thing, staying loyal to my no sugar rule was easy but hitting the macros was impossible considering I had to ingest about 2400 calories and my daily intake was probably like 1000 before I started all that. I trained calisthenics, hoping one day to be one of those super athletes doing muscle ups and planches but after a whole year of consistent workouts with minimal progress, it really harmed my motivation. And i quit, then i broke my hand, giving me all the more reasons to stay quitted (if that's a word) From then, i just went into a downwards spiral, eating shit, less exercise, more video games, back to social media, and during all of this since i was about 11, i have been fighting a massive porn addiction. Now I'm here, leaving my room less than once a day unless its for work or school, diet consisting of like 60% junk food, drinking like 200ml of water a day and now I'm the deepest in my addiction than i have ever been. I did at one point resort to staying high, as much as possible but on my first time back on weed, i had a full blown panic attack and never did it again. I have minimum 3 sleepless nights a week, and I'm overloading myself with melatonin every night which doesn't help, just makes me nauseous the next day.A reoccurring theme in my life is to get bored. I have experienced a low mood for months when i was about 12 and it rooted from life being boring and repetitive. Wake up, get ready, go to school, get bored shitless, come home, eat, sleep, repeat. When i started working out (at 13yrs old) it added a difference to my life. it was the one thing i looked forward to every day. Then that got boring after a year. Then i got a job, and currently that is the only enjoyable thing in my life right now. Its the only social interaction i get. I love the customers, the managers, the co-workers and I'm good at my job. I work at a restaurant serving food, cleaning tables, taking orders and much more. School or any education at all is the most repetitive thing to me. I used to look forward to my future. I wanted to go to uni and become a physiotherapist but now i despise the idea of uni with all my heart and hope to drop out before finishing school.With all this shit ruining my mental health, i hate myself even more for even letting it get to me. My thought process is ""Who the fuck am i to be sad? People go through way harder shit then me and are happier. War veterans, orphans, cancer patients. I'm so selfish for thinking i need help, love and support to get over my SaDnEsS when people are suffering real problems and real depression for real reasons."" I could literally not name one thing positive about myself. Every motivational quote i hear make me hate myself even more. For example ""Would you accept a billion dollars if it meant you wouldn't wake up tomorrow?"" ""No"" ""So treat your life like its worth more than that"" But then i think to myself that its bullshit. I am worth nothing so why would i not accept that? At least then will i be worth something, and have somethin to leave behind to my family.If you read this far, i cant thankyou enough. You took your time out of your day just to read a random kids feeling for no personal gain, so again thankyou. Any comments will be greatly appreciated no matter what it is you have to say.";Hello.

1c4i9ko;How do I help a friend with bipolar disorder without making them feel as if its a hinderance?;Apollo______________;I have had my experience with depression, and when I used to go to therapy sessions I wasn't a big fan of how they would talk to me. It made me feel special in a way that I didn't want to feel, as if I was a problem. Now I have a very good friend who has mentioned she has bipolar disorder, she does not seek medical care for it. As it is not that severe, I have done my research and she barely has manic episodes but rather a lot more depressive ones. I have a special place in my heart for her and I really want to help her. She sometimes feels as if nobody is there for her or that nobody cares for her. More recently she has mentioned that the amount of care I give her, is an amount she has never experienced and is confused with it. It is the most genuine care I have ever given to anybody and I believe she deserves the world. She also admitted feelings for me a while back (I have feelings for her too), I do not know how she feels now but I still want the best for her.How do I give her assistance with this, without making her feel as if she is not normal in a bad way.

1c4hu3f;very scared of schizophrenia;Character-Job9602;hi! i’ve been afraid of schizophrenia for some time now. One day it’s better and I don’t think about it at all and other days I just want to cry because I’m so afraid of the unknown. Basically I don’t have any predispositions to develop it,but a few months back I randomly started reading about it and got so scared that I’ve been reading a lot about symptoms,types of hallucinations and facts about it. It made me monitor every thought I had,any movement in my peripheral vision too (though it was always just something that was already there or just someone/something actually moving). It basically became an obsession I guess since I started seeking reassurance basically every day and checked the symptoms over and over again even though I knew them. I looked for reddit posts about it where people were very helpful and it made me calmer but then I think I actually got some auditory hallucinations? Either way they were like the doom of me. Not long ago I was in my bathroom just brushing my teeth and I heard very clearly a notification from my phone-went to check it and there was nothing (not only that,my phone was on silent mode). Then when I was in the bathroom again,closed door just preparing for bed I thought I heard my mom say something to me but she didn’t. I guess it makes sense since when I’m in the bathroom she tends to say something to me sometimes and I’m afraid I might not hear her and it was like the 3rd time? this happened ever since I was a kid (just kind of being alert about it). I’m sorry if it’s a long post but I am just afraid every day and I’ve really had enough of it. I want to get better. I don’t want to be scared anymore but those hallucinations (I guess) really keep me from it. Everything else is fine,only sometimes when I’m walking with my dog at night I’m a little scared if I see a guy and we’re alone on a street (yk just woman things haha). But every time I get a weird thought (and sometimes I get intrusive ones) I tend to get scared it might be a delusion too (though I know it’s not since I do t believe it,just makes me uneasy sometimes). I tried to list everything I could,but please,from the bottom of my heart. If you have any suggestions, any friends/close ones who sadly suffer from schizophrenia please tell me if it sounds like I could have it? I already know it’s pretty rare,but as you can see I really need any reassurance I can get. Maybe someone is going through something similar? I’m working on going to a therapist by the way! So anything you want to say is welcome. Thank you in advance and sorry if the post is kinda messy!;hi! i’ve been afraid of schizophrenia for some time now.

I suddenly feel like I don't truly know any of my family members or the people around me. I usually get like that sometimes but not feeling unfamiliar with people I thought I felt close to. I'm just now realizing i dont talk to people with a second thought for some reason. and ever since that incident, i am thinking about stuff i dont usually care or think about and its scary i feel like i dont actually know ACTUALLY anyone or myself, I feel like I was mindlessly interacting with people.

1c4hlik;Baby brother (7) got bitten by a pit bull in public and the situation upset me;kna101;My younger sister (18) and my little baby brother were walking near my parents house and he was bitten by a pit bull. The owner was not there and it ran out of the house and went over the fence. It kept trying to play with him and my sister had her bag trying to protect my brother. It then bit my brother on his tummy and back with deep puncture bruises and scratches. My brother was traumatised. The owner later came out and tried to get the dog. My sis called the police and one of the officers were very aggressive, he even took the phone off my sis and told the ambulance it was not necessary and explained to my dad that the dog is friendly and it’s just a scratch. They said that they were wasting police time and to not call again re: this. My parents got scared and they didn’t take my brother to hospital. The neighbours came out and said this was an ongoing issue and the police don’t care. My parents did take my brother to the doctor and they gave him the rabies shot. I feel so bad for my brother.

1c4hi9x;6 years and 3 diagnoses later...;i-just-wanna-be-edgy;"Good news, but also kind of a vent.I receieved my first psychiatric evaluation at 16 from a therapist both my mom and I were seeing (separately). It was one of the 400 t/f questionnaires. With the results and multiple sessions, the therapist determined that I had major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety. Being a teenager was hard, and dealing with stuff at home, people at school, and bias from teachers made things... a lot harder. My insurance at the time didn't cover a psychiatrist, so I spoke with my PCP about anxiety and antidepressants. I was immediately dismissed as ""oviously bipolar"" and told she could not prescribe them or my moods would become ""drastically unstable."" I should note that I am AFAB, and in retrospect it felt very ""Yellow Wallpaper"" of her, but when you're 16, you listen to the doctors, especially when you want relief. The therapist lost his license when I turned 18, and around that time, I was finally able to find a psychatrist on my insurance as I was an adult. I was evaluated for around 15 minutes and prescribed my first antipsychotic. It went horribly, I was constantly depressed, I gained a lot of weight, and I was having spicy sad feelings. When I reported these symptoms to the psychiatrist, he consistently upped my dosage; in a period of 8 months, it had increased by 300%. It wasn't until I insisted that I switch that he changed me to another antipsychotic. We had appointments once a month, and each time, I would have a 5 minute phone call where he would ask me about the weather and how the medications were going. I was placed on 3 different antipsychotics before I got fed up with him constantly ignoring my concerns. Thankfully, my PCP had heard that he was not the best and understood.When I turned 20, I was able to find a new therapist and received my second evaluation. This evaluation was more in depth and included an interview from a separate therapist (for evaluation purposes). I was diagnosed with bpd, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and ptsd. I continued with my therapist until she left and voiced that I did not agree with the diagnosis. At the same time, I had been trying to get my pcp to remove bipolar disorder from my record, but she didn't believe me.After my therapist left, I was placed with a new one who heavily led with my diagnosis instead of listening to my concerns. At one point she said ""why does this matter?"" I cried in the session, shut down, and changed therapists quickly atter. I started meeting with a new therapist at the same location, this one specialized, or at least frequently worked with those with bpd. After meeting for about a year, she asked me if I felt like I had bpd; we went over the criteria, discussed it in length. She notice inconsistencies in my previous evaluation and consulted with her supervisor, which resulted in me getting my final and most recent evaluation. I spent 4 hours meeting with a therapist for my evaluation and received a diagnosis of ADHD and PTSD. The bpd was removed. I was given a copy and able to provide physical evidence that I was not Bipolar, did not have BPD, and they were finally removed from my record. At first, I thought maybe I had tricked my therapist or my evaluators. That because my mom has bpd and because I don't want to be her that I had subconsciously manipulated them. Depsite my therapist, my friends with psychology degrees, and close family said they ""thought I knew"" I had ADHD, I was still working with the first evaluation results. It wasn't until I started taking ADHD medication that I realized that the diagnosis was correct. It's a relief, but also upsetting that it took 6 years to get this far.Tl;dr: I was constantly misdiagnosed with mood disorders for years, dismissed by my health providers. I finally received a diagnosis of ADHD and the medication is going well. And no, I did not lose my sparkle. Misogyny and class prejudice is still incredibly prevalent within mental health care.

I didn't treat her the way I should have and I think this is my punishment for my actions. The happiness I feel in the dreams is what makes them nightmares because waking up knowing ill never come close to being as happy as I felt in the dreams with her.

1c4h78j;I can't recover from being where I was supposed to recover;Bakugou_Izuku;"Before I get into this: I'm finally on meds that actually mostly help, and I dont want to upset myself, so I won't go into too much detail. (16 ftm) CW for a little language/cursing + mention of sexual harassmentIn February I ran away with the help of a ""friend"" to get to a mental facility in the closest children's hospital. I went because of suicidal thoughts and recent self harm, and I wasn't sure if I'd make it to the next day or so. My parents tracked me down and just... the confrontation and atmosphere was absolutely fucking terrifying. Having to get blood drawn there is now keeping me from being able to again. I think the only time I'll be able to is when it's absolutely medically necessary and/or when I can start T. Other than that I get flashbacks any time it's brought up. Fortunately, the person who drove me is no longer part of my life. And, fun fact, their family has essentially kidnapped/abducted other people, including my partner.I get flashbacks of the whole stay (5 days I think) almost every night and I don't know what the fuck to do. I talked to my psychiatrist and she increased my dose by 5ml, but I still get the flashbacks and bad dreams which luckily isn't as frequent. I think about it all the time, I get constant reminders of it. I just feel trapped. Not to mention I've recently been dealing with what could easily be considered sexual harassment by another ""friend"" at school. And not even two weeks ago my dad started an argument over something small that was causing me to feel dysphoric and stormed out of the house. This was at 2:00-3:30; my mom was trying to calm me down for over an hour, my dad was watching/listening through a puppy cam until he came back at around 8:30-ish that morning.Anyway, there's a lot going on rn, and the combination of flashbacks and dysphoria and all the other shit is overwhelming and making me feel trapped.

1c4h6fl;Why am I so young but feel like I’m at the end of my time?;Yxkozai;"I’m a young kid, I’m a sophomore going into my junior year in a few months and it feels like I’ve wasted the first two years I’ve even got to highschool. I personally “peaked” in middle school which is sad to say, i had everything ive ever wanted and had happiness I couldn’t even comprehend holding today. I feel like I’ve lost it all and my personal spark to wonder what life would feel like if I stayed here another year (which I feel like I’d waste away until I get to my senior year.) I know I’m still a kid and I should just focus on the good times life is blessing me with but I just feel like there’s this part of me that’s saying I should go now, like my time is up. I’ve lost everything and I don’t know where to go since I say one day it’ll get better but those days have now turned into years; 3 years. Throughout those three years, I’ve thought about the same things, why can’t I have the love I was once surrounded with, why do people now see me differently and no longer find interest in me, and why can’t I become happy when life gives me the option to grow? I wonder how useless life is considering your name won’t even be mentioned years after I pass. People would be sad, but I’d feel like I’m accomplishing what I’ve thought was right, but I don’t want a permanent solution to a temporary problem but death doesn’t seem to be a burden anymore. I’m talking all around in this writing but I can’t even seem to think straight to express how I wanna die, like it already feels meaningless to confess it since it’s been on my mind so often that it almost seems convenient. I just wish I had my spark again, my friends again, the love from my family and peers but it all left me faster than I could even get to high school. I feel as if my life has no more storyline to it and my chapter is done, like I’m one of the short books in a library and wasn’t gifted with more pages to my chapters. Maybe I’m just in a bad place with no motivation to climb out of a hole that I’ve gotten into, I know if I was back to a place where I felt like I fit in, I could recover and put this mess behind me. It’s been three years since I’ve felt like this, 3 years is a long time for someone of my age, like I’ve felt this for a long time. In my stand point, I just wanna be happy. I know all the reasons I’m not sparked but even if I think about them, I’d get lost in this over stimulation of emotion to where I shut down and give up. I feel like I’ve failed everyone down to the core and they all see it as “who I am” which is always the title I’ve given when I mess up, “it’s just who you are.” I’ve lived my life from elementary to middle as this well known kid with a friend on every corner to talk to but now I feel like there’s no one in my field when I know there’s someone out there around me who actually cares. I like to think I’ll get over it, but I end up waiting and wasting my time away with smoking or something of the sort. I feel like a dirty kid who became a quiet person that’s hard to get along with since it felt so easy for everyone to move on from me. I understand I sound selfish like I deserve more than gods given me, but 3 years just to rot away and grow older is something I can no longer hold in my mindset.";I’m a young kid, I’m a sophomore going into my junior year in a few months and it feels like I’ve wa;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-15 08:35:41;2024-04-15;Monday;08:35:41;3235;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:54.650247

Now, I have quit vaping but in turn I have started to gamble (I’ve lost over a 1000$ in 2 months) , and  I’ve began to drink more often (4-5 times a week, 3 causally, 1-2 more intensely), I have also started to be more risky with driving, and picked up a caffeine addiction too.

Could I have a mental illness aside from OCD, or could this be OCD? Ugh, it’s just confusing. I just really want to know what the heck is going on so I can work on this.Here is an example:One day I decided I was going to go to college for something and then the next day I decided I was going to do something else that was not going to benefit me in any way. A few hours after that, I decided I was going to shave my head. I don’t really know how to explain it in a way that makes complete sense. Am I just an impulsive person? Could this be OCD? Is this normal?It is starting to take a major toll on me because I have no freaking clue who I am, what I like, what I want to do, what I want to wear. I feel as if I’ve created many versions of myself. I don’t know. I guess I just would like to know if I should be worried.This part kind of worries me though:One evening I told myself I was going to do something to help make my life better, and within an hour, I told myself I was going to do the exact opposite of that and do something very dangerous, something that would permanently alter my life in a negative way.Is this normal?

All pretty shit stuff to happen to someone.My brother cannot get over this betrayal and is still extremely angry and in pain! It has affected his mental health, relationships and ability to express himself confidently. It’s tough to see, especially because he is a fundamentally good person with lots to offer. I really want him to find this closure, realise this anger and move on! Btw I don’t think we can talk to the ex friend as he’s pretty immature and it’s still painting a false story about the whole ordeal. There’s heaps of little details etc but I don’t want to exhaust you. What can I do to help?! What can he do to move past it for good?! Please help I’m really concerned for his life.

Quick backstory - Daddy issues, never met him, never will, his choice. A few years ago it was cocaine and alcohol, then a suicide attempt after the delusions got so bad. Dr prescribed sleeping pills, which helped somewhat, I guess. Nowadays I drink to excess and have been “lucky” enough to be prescribed Codeine for back pain, which I abuse. I love the “warm blanket” feeling that I get, and the sense of numbness. My partner keeps saying “please stop drinking so much”, I promise I’ll try harder, but I can’t seem to stop. I’ve tried therapy, it was ok, but it’s hard talking about your deep set issues and feelings. I take a few “proper” meds already, Propalanol for panic attacks, Prozac for the depression. Is there something I can take to stave off the reliance on booze and codeine? Do I need an antipsychotic?

I just hallucinate or have horrible thoughts and that really affects me and my daily activities. My brain will come up with the most horrifying thoughts and I’ll be scared shitless.

I will be trying to sleep but then I’ll see shadows around me and the sound of someone breathing. I will be trying to sleep but then I’ll hear someone walking around outside. My brain makes up these noises and it terrifies me. -I’m too paranoid. I always feel like crap at school. I am walking around and when people laugh I think they’re laughing at me. If people stare, I get horrified. If someone is behind me, I feel like they’re following me. If someone behind me has their phone out, I feel like they are recording me. I feel like many people are planning something against me. I feel like I’m always being followed and watched. I sometimes worry that someone will break in my house so I sleep with a knife. -I don’t get enough sleep. I try but I just can’t. I’m tired but I can’t sleep. -Sometimes I just want to scream and cry.-My lack of motivation. I just don’t have motivation to do anything.

She almost died, she was in the hospital for two weeks, in and out of rehab for three years. She got sober when I was around 15. About a year ago I found out she had relapsed three years ago and never told me. She said it was a one time thing and worked with her sponsor about it. Since then she has been sober. Recently she has gone through a really hard break up. They’ve been together for years and live together and she’s having a hard time finding a new place to live. On top of that about three weeks ago we went to see my dad for the first time in years together (a very triggering relationship for me and I assume her) all while this was going on for her. Since the trip she hasn’t reached out to me. I called her last week and she didn’t pick up. Normally when she doesn’t pick up she will text me being like “hey can I call you tomorrow”, but there was nothing. Then called her today again and she didn’t pick up so I texted her and just said “hey give me a call back when you can.” She called me back later tonight but she just seemed a bit out of it. Still herself but I could tell she wasn’t really paying attention to what I was saying, granted it’s late and she might have been tired. I told her she seems out of it and she said she was going through a lot, which is understandable with her breakup and moving. I can’t help but fear she might be relapsing. All today I was so triggered, going back to that emotional place when she almost died. I couldn’t stop crying at work and imaging what it would be like if she died.

Anxiety is a disorder that can come in many shapes and sizes, the symptoms and intensities will vary. However, the most commonly associated sensation is ""uncontrollable worrying"" and ""distress"", but a lot of people get the wrong idea that this means a conscious sensation.   Anxiety (and related conditions) usually manifest themselves sub-consciously and cause bodily symptoms, e.g: breathing difficulties; chest discomfort/pain (that can mimic the sensation you'd expect from heart failure); numbness (static) sensation in the extremities (hands/feet); and dizziness/light-headedness/confusion.  I've explained anxiety and panic related conditions to a lot of people over the years, and the most frequent symptom (or sensation) people report is psychosomatic (somatic conditions being ruled out by medical tests) symptoms relating to their worry/distress, e.g: chest pain (which is arguably the most common symptom due to a fear of a heart related condition).  When you experience the symptoms/sensations: try inhaling slowly and fully (fill your lungs) through your nose, exhaling slowly and completely (empty your lungs) through your mouth, repeat 7-8 times. This breathing technique usually helps you calm down and can alleviate anxiety and a range of other psychological and emotional conditions (it will require some practice).";"You don't have to feel ""anxious” either for these symptoms to arise.

1c4evhw;Anxiety and excitement share the same biological responses.;Qmeieriet;"When you get ""anxious"" also now referred to as ""excited"":Your hormones shoot up Adrenaline (Epinephrine) which increase your heart rate and alertness. It also shoots up cortisol, which is a stress hormone that is associated with energy.The physiological effect: increased heart rate (more blood flowing through your body to provide nutrients). increased respiratory rate (rapid breathing to further take in o2 and remove Co2, this also provide more resources to your body). sweating (your body cools down to prevent over-heating). pupils dilate (this effect makes your eyes taking in more light, which translates to: more visual information and alertness) muscle tension (prepares the muscle for physical response)I can go into deep detail about this, but I'll briefly touch on the neurological response as that get's technical quickly: norepinephrine spikes (increased alertness) dopamine spikes (pleasure and excitement chemical (neurotransmitter)) serotonin spike (associated with mood and anxiety regulation) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (another neurotrans that helps with brain activity and can affect anxiety levels (note: GABA is what anxiety medications, such as: Benzodiazepines act on (I highly advise you to avoid BZO though))Conclusion:Anxiety and excitement are similar as both emotions trigger an increased physiological response (as mentioned above), the key difference between feeling anxious and excited is that you associate the feeling with something threatening or that it might lead to negative outcomes, but you can turn that around and start associating it with desirable events, creating a sense of thrill and anticipation.Anxiety and excitement is the same emotion, but your association to it determines if it's bad or good. Now every time you get anxious: slowly breath in deeply with your nose, and exhale through your mouth (really fill and empty your lungs) 4-5 times - this trigger your vagus nerve to relax which further calms you down from the high intensity emotion, once calm try getting to know the excitement sensation, learning to be able to stand in it will give you a huge advantage.I work drastically better in high intensity stress situations, throw me at someone needing EMS treatment and is in critical condition; I feel calm; focused; and content - and the same goes for martial arts, you need to be able to handle high intensity; it's your brain and body preparing you to react to the situation.";"When you get ""anxious"" also now referred to as ""excited"":Your hormones shoot up Adrenaline (Epinephr";Inspiration / Encouragement;1;2;2024-04-15 05:57:56;2024-04-15;Monday;05:57:56;2443;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 09:09:46.494007
1c4ev61;The modern society is creating a high anxiety condition.;Qmeieriet;"We live in a society with high anxiety as a consequence of social media; body image, sex, and other social expectations pressure, and our primitive brain's need for anxiety as a defense mechanism.Social media platforms are part of our lives, allowing constant access to sharing a variety of information. However, they also contribute to anxiety by creating a culture of comparison, where people constantly compare their lives, achievements, and looks. The idealized versions of others' lives often shown on social media can make us feel inadequate and anxious about our own lives.Society puts pressure on physical appearance, sexuality, and social status. The pressure to conform to these standards can be overwhelming and cause anxiety. Unrealistic beauty standards, sexual expectations, and the pursuit of material success can create a constant sense of inadequacy and anxiety about fitting in or meeting societal expectations.Our primitive brain developed to protect us from threats and ensure survival, making it naturally prone to experience anxiety. It constantly scans the environment for potential dangers and triggers the ""fight-flight-or-freeze"" response when it senses a threat. While this response was crucial for our ancestors' survival, in modern society, it can be easily triggered by various factors, such as: social pressures. This constant state of arousal can result in anxiety and contribute to high anxiety levels in society.In short, social media, societal pressures, and our primitive brain's defense mechanism all contribute to the high anxiety levels in our society. Recognizing these factors and adopting strategies to manage anxiety, like mindfulness, self-care, and seeking support, can help us navigate the challenges of living in an anxiety-inducing environment.";"We live in a society with high anxiety as a consequence of social media; body image, sex, and other ";Inspiration / Encouragement;1;5;2024-04-15 05:57:19;2024-04-15;Monday;05:57:19;1792;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 09:09:46.495412

1c4edq4;workaholic parents + Burnout;RosePetalsAnd_Thorns;"Does anyone else suffer from a dysfunctional family that centers around money, working alot and forced toxic positivey about doing stuff everyday to ""improve your life""?He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flaresI know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.Anyways that's my rant. Does anyone have similar parents? What have you done in terms of burnout and ocd? I take supplements Like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, gaba, magnesium bisglycinate, and 5-http.I have read a bit of atomic habits and the daily stoic 366 meditations by Ryan Holiday.

1c4e5hz;How does one heal from grade school bullying ?;Complex_Recover4595;Hi, do I ask this question because i’m trying to heal my inner child and I’m struggling to heal my childhood wounds. So growing up as an Indian American who comes from an immigrant family, I always had a hard time fitting in especially in school. I was “special ed” during my grade school which infuriated me more, because I don’t want to be seen as dumb. I was a quiet kid in school and never spoke to anyone, and because of that I used to get picked on and teased by the “loud people” in school. I wanted to be friends with the smart Indian/South Asian girls, but I always felt left out.  In 6/7th grade I befriended this Pakistani girl whom was nice to me and I thought she was my friend.. We spoke about things like school and bullies etc during PE class when we would have the jogging/walking warm ups. I used to succumb to her because I just didn’t want to feel isolated during PE class, because thats when the bullies would prey upon me. But in 8th grade she got “popular” she got her own group of friends and I tried to succumb to their group, but they would kind of still outcast me. They were like pushing me, shoving me, they would point at me, then at one point the girl who I thought was nice said “we need space” something along those lines ,basically saying they don’t want me around them. Then I think they were gossiping about me.  Then at the end of that PE class they started acting weird and started “messing around” with me. They started asking me weird perverted questions like “do you know what a doorknob is” and I’m like “idk” and then they kind of started to act more weird with me and I say something like “stop harassing me” and I tell them to stop then they started messing around with me again. And gaslighted me and told me I’m “bullying them” my heart sank, I was heart broken, I got teary eyed, my chest was aching. I tried to ignore but it was bothering me and it got worse. Then they joined a grouo of girls where they would spread these mean nasty rumors about me about the way I “smelled” and the way I looked.  They would literally look at me and they would all laugh in a group. I was singled out and everyone knew that “this person and soandso were talking about you” I complained about them to the PE teacher and guidance and they had a “talk” with them and the guidance said they “won’t do it again” but it was heart wrenching. I cried so much that day, I was hurting because of this incident for so many years. Middle schoolers were so mean to me and I used to get picked on ALL the time because I was a shy timid kid that didn’t speak AT ALL. I would be treated like I’m very stupid by my peers/students.  I would get so much anxiety about it and I had this anxiety and panic attacks till high school (I’m 23 now) reflecting back on it, I don’t know what advice to give to my younger self. I would tell myself to not tell your trauma to outsiders otherwise you’ll keep repeating those experiences. But I feel like because I was “special ed” I wasn’t able to befriend people I wanted to because I was “too stupid “ for the South Asians and I had friends but they were mostly white. I had so much trauma and anxiety about this, when I was younger. Kids were literally SOO mean to me for no reason. And I still struggle to make friends at this age.

I have had issues with impulsive/erratic behaviors that have gotten better as I get older but I also go to therapy because I have been dealing with emetophobia, anxiety, problems navigating social life, problems with ADHD, nicotine/alcohol addiction/,self-esteem, past SI and PTSD. I also have some issues with my behavior such as anger issues, cursing, irritability and some arguably disrespectful behavior (according to my mom) which I’m trying to work on as well.I have been to 6 different therapists since I started but I did make a bit of progress in my sessions as far as my mental health. My mom started to change the way she parents because she thought that she wasn’t seeing the results she wanted to see so she started taking things away from me for failing to come out of my room before a certain time while getting ready for school, constant humiliation/ridicule and a general lack of consideration on her part. I struggle with making friends and other meaningful connections and I have also dealt with trauma from being kicked out of a friend group where the supposed leaders didn’t like me so I try to make myself more likable to others, and find ways to communicate with others my age outside of school or virtually. I’m not allowed to have any form of social media bc she thinks that its the reason why my graders were slipping in 7th grade and that it “will cause problems for me.” She has also began to do this bs where she says that I’m selfish/rude/narcissistic/disrespectful/ nosy/ irresponsible/etc to make sure I know what I need to work on but when I apply those same terms to her, its seen as disrespectful and I can’t talk to her that way because she is my mother. When I say those things to her she brings up all the times she spent money on me/took me places/or reminds me of the mistakes I’ve made in the past (when i say those things she says its “name-calling”.)I constantly try to vocalize how I feel abt the way she treats me/things I would like her to change/etc but she constantly refuses to listen or acknowledge that she may be causing a problem by justifying her behavior with “I’m the adult here” or saying that she doesn’t have time to argue with me over this. I started to defend myself even though she is older than me because I constantly feel like I don’t have control over my own life and I constantly get in trouble for voicing my opinions and concerns abt the way she parents. She recently decided to kick me out of therapy because I was cursing, yelling, “name-calling”, etc and said that I can’t go back to therapy until I change my behaviors. I have pleaded with her numerous times to tell her that I still need help and that her reasons for doing this aren’t ethical/fair to me. I try to deal with it on my own but I feel worse with every day and I don’t want to find comfort in drugs/alcohol/unhealthy behaviors to deal with my problems. She also has a tendency to blow things out of proportion when she would update my therapists on what has been going on at home and make me look like the bad guy constantly and forgets that she has contributed to some the issues at home. I’m not sure that my African mom’s culture/ideals/friends have influenced her decision to pull me out of therapy but it has influenced her actions and expectations for me.I need to be able to confide in someone that won’t judge me for my actions and get me the help I need. Even though I can talk to friends, I really don’t want to weigh them down w my own personal issues or make them like me less because of my problems. I can’t talk to a school counselor either because she has made me feel like my problems with others weren’t valid or that there was something wrong with me for being upset with someone that has continually caused problems in my life and she may tell the school about certain things that may get me in trouble and other adults may js tell my mom and she will be livid.I still want my mom to be in my life but she makes me feel so bad abt myself every day that I don’t feel safe enough to confide in her but if she keeps this up, I can say with full confidence that I won’t want anything to do with her as an adult because she fails to support me in the way I need her to most. I reside in the state of Colorado (US) where minors 12 and older can independently consent to/refuse to consent to psychiatric care w/o parents permission. I really want to go to therapy to better myself in the future as an adult that can advocate for herself and navigate life independently but I’m not sure where to look.

Our concern is that even though ESA’s are protected for California renters, landlords are shitty and the added stress from housing insecurity will offset the benefits of the animal. Within our budget there are only ever one or two properties on the market that say they allow pets so in all likelihood we would need to bring an ESA certification letter to a no-pets-allowed property.

1c4dubt;Boyfriend keeps trying to diagnose me;shadow_to_gold;"We’ve had a lot of issues. But a huge one has been drug and alcohol abuse. We went through some dark times and were very codependent. I admittedly had serious trust issues that were taxing on him. But I honestly think a huge factor was the lifestyle and the people it came with. It wasn’t a safe environment in terms of health and stability and untrustworthy friends, so I felt unsafe and it makes sense I had trust issues.We are currently doing long distance and I think it’s been healthy. I’m not yet sure we should continue our relationship but taking space to figure it out and not in a rush… but one issue is he keeps telling me to get screened for serious mental illness.The work I’ve been focusing on is trauma work and developing a spiritual practice, meditation and mindfulness, getting sober, rebuilding my own life, spending time with family and healthier friendships so as not to be codependent or revolve around his life. I’m not against therapy and have tried in the past when I could afford it. He actually has never had his own therapist. But he reads up a lot on mental illnesses - online - and I feel like almost obsesses about labels. He tells me to do CBT or whatever process. Again, not against it. But I feel like when I bring up sobriety as a priority, he glosses over that. But then turns around and says I should get screened. I’m bothered that he acts like he knows what he’s talking about. And hasn’t even tried therapy himself. Except when I suggested we try couples therapy. We tried together very briefly.I understand that diagnosis can be validating at times and also helpful in determining treatment. But in this case I think I would just feel like someone would be telling me something is wrong with me and I’m not sure how helpful that is. I don’t see the point of therapy as being labeled or medicated. I see the point of therapy as healing.I feel insulted that he tries to diagnose me when he’s not a professional and he thinks I should get screened. And he’s not exactly working on himself. It just feels like a possible way to blame me for things. Like I’m the problem, not the drugs and alcohol.Basically I find it more insulting; it’s hard to see it as helpful.Am I wrong? Am I missing something? Is it a good idea to get screened? It’s not something I would think to do for myself.

I'm also just having issues with my emotions and the lack thereof. I can't tell if these are symptoms of ADD or something else, but I don't trust anyone who tells me that I'm okay. Like, how would they know.    Nobody else in my family has been diagnosed with any chronic mental illness (that I/we know of), so I can't trace it to anything. I feel like I'm the only person who feels this delusional all the time.     Nothing ever feels real or in the moment, and memories feel like they've been put in my head by something else. At this point, I can't remember what I've imagined and what I've experienced, but it's intertwined.     I feel like there's something horribly wrong with me, and it just grows stronger every day. I really need to talk to a mental health professional so I can get better. I can't do another therapist. They just don't work. Where can I go to really get examined and get the help I actually need.

1c4dq2s;Why do I feel like I don't exist sometimes?;Sprout-79;Warning of life dumping, ranting, and maybe self pity (not even sure at this point)I don't know why but sometimes I feel like I just dont exist. Kind of like being just invisible and unwanted. Like I feel like people just don't acknowledge I exist. Since I was little I've had friends forget about me, I've gone to restaurants and places and the staff will pay attention to every person but me, I've been left out of family pictures because people forgot to get me, teachers have forgotten I was in their class. I play tennis too, where I've had people completely ignore me and only pay attention to my doubles partner.I don't know if I'm just that quiet or if people just genuinely forget I exist. I feel like it's one of the things that contributed to my sense self worth just being destroyed and maybe some of the thoughts I've had about myself. I can't figure out if its a symptom of anything or if its maybe part of something bigger or if I'm just kind of an invisible person.Has anyone else ever felt similar or noticed any people kind of like that?;Warning of life dumping, ranting, and maybe self pity (not even sure at this point)I don't know why ;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-15 04:47:00;2024-04-15;Monday;04:47:00;1055;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 09:09:46.530822
1c4dp3w;Embarrassment after extreme mental break down ;Objective_Animal_660;I struggle with my mental health after a decent amount of trauma growing up, as a lot of us do… I started therapy at 13, was diagnosed with OCD, CPTSD, and ADHD. I also got a bachelors in psychology because my own struggles have given me such a perspective and passion for the field. Two years ago, I went through a long period of time that was the roughest and most traumatic things I’d ever gone through. Without getting into too much detail, it was enough that my university suggest that I withdraw for a semester. Which was suppose to be my last semester until I graduated. I took the semester to heal and make changes to my situation. Spent nearly a year doing what felt like “healing” or processing things.But starting on April 8th, my OCD was starting to get really bad. For a period of 24 hours I had a complete mental break. I’ve had plenty of panic attacks or periods of rough mental health. However, this was completely different than what I’ve experienced before. It started as a panic attack due to a trauma trigger but reached a point of delusion / fear that felt more like psychosis. I told a friend that I feared I may be in psychosis several times but she believed it was panic attack due to my OCD. I unfortunately sent a neighbor I had some crush on some crazy strange texts. Acted even more bizarre in person, and knocked on other neighbors doors. Was obviously in a distraught state and I’m sure scared some people.. After taking some panic attack medicine from my doctor, and getting some needed sleep… I’m so humiliated :/I can’t stop thinking about how I acted and how embarrassed I am.

I no longer live with my family, work at a sports bar, and am attending college close by-l just started ""adulting"". I live with my boyfriend and we have gotten into a couple of arguments about my inability to reject people, which is the reason I've learned this about myself. (Side note: I totally agree with why he is upset at me and I would be upset at him if the roles were reversed so the problem isn't us fighting.) One of the two arguments was about me taking a guy's number at work. Instead of telling the guy no, I felt too guilty turning him down that I just went along with it. I am too much of a people pleaser and doormat in these types of situations. Another instance just happened today when my manager asked me to use my car to go to the gas station. I obviously didnt want to say yes, but somehow I just brushed him off instead of just telling him no. I feel like I am afraid of confrontation in general because I was raised by grandparents who constantly fought in front of me. In other aspects of my life, I am working to overcome the fear, but for some reason I can't get past this problem.What can I do/tell myself so that I can tell people no?";I (f20) have recently realized that I have a very hard time telling people no.

1c4dh30;So depressed lately;king_messi_;I am overwhelmed with depression and I haven’t experienced this in a while. It’s so bad and I don’t know what to do to make it go away, but I also don’t want it to go away, if that makes sense? Depression has been a part of me for as long as I can remember. Depression, anxiety, PTSD: Diagnosed 2010 when I was 14. OCD: Diagnosed when I was 16. ADHD: Diagnosed when I was 23. I turn 29 in July. I have one kid, two cats, and I left my ex-husband over a year ago for 10 years of abuse. I survived childhood abuse, too. It feels like I can’t breathe some days. My chest is so tight. I do see a therapist but I don’t want to say anything because I don’t like to be pitied. I don’t like people feeling bad for me. I want to say what I want to say and get a neutral response. But I also don’t want to be analysed. I hate being vulnerable in spaces where people know me. Reddit is safe as an anonymous space because I curate it that way. I feel so alone. Half of my family disowned me when I put my father in jail. Friends took my ex’s side even though he tried to kill me and put hands on our child. I’m so fucking alone. So fucking sad. Overcome with grief about everything. I know nothing but trauma, I guess I can consider that my default state. Brother assaulted me when I was 16, he was 18. Mom was diagnosed with cancer two times & survived both times. Grew up in poverty and begged on the streets for food as a teenager or we dumpster dived. I don’t know what to do anymore. I know I have to keep living for my child. I know if I died, it would traumatise the fucking hell out of her. And I love her too much to go through with it. But I’m so sad. I’m so fucking sad. And I’m tired. I’m in college to get my certificates back for EMS so I can be an EMT again. So hopefully things change soon. If you read this far, thank you.

Just acquaintances, from work and school.Some of my friends/acquaintances, it's even women who approach them and no one ever approaches me...I only have 3 very close friends, and I told them my story, in general I am an introvert.And well, if I'm honest, I had accepted that that was my reality, and that it was better not to believe that it would be different, if it were, it would have already happened in my 26 years.But it has started to bother me because I see how my classmates from primary / secondary / are already getting married and at work they usually show affection to other people and not to me. (by affection I mean hugs or that feeling that someone cares about you, that they come to greet you or whatever)I do not rule out that perhaps my insecurities make people think that I reject them, when that is not the case, rather I do it out of respect, perhaps that person does not want me to approach them and it is better not to do it and that makes them not They come closer because they don't want to make me uncomfortable (but I don't think so)...

But I try to move forward being the best version I can, giving love without having to receive anything in return.I was very hesitant to write this, for fear of being judged, but it was something I had to express and see if it happens to anyone else and how they moved on.Thank you for your responses and I wish you the best.;I am 26 years old, I have never had my first kiss, nor have I had a girlfriend and I consider myself;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-15 03:27:54;2024-04-15;Monday;03:27:54;2145;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:55.777478

1c4bis3;I have something going on with me but I can’t figure out what the issue is;MomoIsBaby;I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, and so far all I’ve got from my treatment is that I have ADHD lol I was diagnosed with GAD and depression a long time ago. One of my previous psych docs thought I had Bipolar Type 2, but when I got my new psychiatrist back in December 2023, she took away my bipolar diagnosis without doing any kind of assessment and said it was more likely that I just have ADHD and was misdiagnosed.I was taken off my mood stabilizer and put on strattera. That helped for about 3 months, but slowly lost effectiveness. I started craving weed and ended up tripping on a heroic dose of LSD. I wasn’t expecting to trip so hard (long story). During my trip I kept fretting that my psychiatrist was wrong and I really do have bipolar, and I was going to end up having an episode and ruining my life (based on past experiences). After that LSD trip, I settled back down somewhat. I also had some issues at work. I have this manager that likes to lecture employees and talk down to us when we’ve done something wrong. It really stresses me out because she chews me out the same way an abusive family member did to me when I was a child.I got in trouble over something small, I forget what it was, but she had me so angry and upset that I started frantically job hunting. I couldn’t get an interview to save my life, however, and I started spiraling emotionally. I was having racing thoughts and severe intrusive thoughts about SH. I came onto Reddit and started posting questions about places to move with good job markets. I impulsively started applying for jobs out of state, and then completely lost the plot and signed a lease to rent a room before I’ve even been hired anywhere.I guess it’s for the best that I move because my home is very toxic, and I haven’t been doing well living with my family for a long time. I want to be excited that I’m moving, but the anxiety and spinning thoughts just won’t go away. I’m still having intrusive thoughts about SH. I won’t hurt myself, but it’s very taxing that I can’t stop thinking about it.I’m taking medication to help with my ADHD and depression, and I’m also taking something to help me sleep.I’m just not sure why I’m struggling so much right now. My psychiatrist increased my strattera dosage, and that helped with the worst of my spiraling, but I just can’t relax at all. My brain is so loud and I just want some mental peace.I don’t really know where I’m going with this. Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest.

Stay and read my pitiful post, or don’t. Appreciate any and all support. I am such a waste of space, I do not feel like a normal human being. I feel like I’m a foreigner in every situation, especially when around other women. I haven’t been given the opportunity to experience fun things in life like other girls, due to a number of setbacks including depression in teenage years, issues in fitting in, and also just being broke. And then for that, I get judged and made to feel more like an outsider… I try to make myself seem more loose and relaxed around new people, but the vibe I get from them makes it seem like they detect I’m not being 100% “normal”.Probably doesn’t make sense, but I don’t think I’m made to be or should be treated like an outsider. I’m relatively normal for my age, I’m very into feminine things, I can be outgoing and I have a job. But too many times, I’ve been in the predicament where I meet other girls and they act like I’m a loser who doesn’t belong there. I’ve met some girls once and one of them was upset about an incident and I was trying to consul and just be nice like all the others were, and then one girl gives me a death glare and bluntly goes “can you just go stand over there”. I’m rejected from these groups, for absolutely no reason. I feel like girls always talk to me with this attitude and abruptness, just makes me feel like shit.Why me? What did I ever do wrong but try to be nice? I forever envy the girls on social media who have friends, relationships, and are treated like a normal human.If people can’t coexist peacefully with me, who is genuinely a good person and wants to go out and make memories, then why should I even stick around depressed? I’m not made to be a loser, I’ve got the drive in me to push for bigger and better things, and a more utopian lifestyle surrounded by friends. Sometimes I think I’m better off just ending it. I’d rather die than live lonely, and disconnected.;19F, this is gonna be a bit of rant, I just need to get it all out in words honestly.

1c4a3wo;I don’t feel stress until it’s panic attack level;Next_Bottle_7362;For some reason I always have this mindset of “everything will be okay, just go with the flow of life. Nothing will ruin your life. You’ll be fine” and I just don’t feel stress. I think a lot of situations are made to be stressful when in reality you’ll be just fine. For example, people get so frustrated over traffic. It’s fine. We aren’t in a rush. Another example, but bigger. The car broke down and we are stranded here until someone can pick us up and give us a ride home. It’s fine, it’s sorted out, we will be fine. That may be healthy,but then there’s this- another example. I had a foster sister. She was my friend before that for about a year. Then her grandma died and she needed a home. My mom took her in and she lived with us for about 5 years, being our sister. Long story short, she and my mom ended up not getting along at all and she ended up leaving. That didn’t affect me at all. I was like “oh, okay.” No disagreement, didn’t and don’t miss her, don’t care. I just don’t care. I also just don’t feel stressed at all about so many other things. That is, until it’s so overbearing I’m hyperventilating. I’ve been kind of known for my calmness and nonchalant style. But when I do get stressed, I’m a wreck. I just get a bad anxiety or even panic attack. I don’t know what this is or if it means anything. Also, I do have anxiety and depression. Anxiety does not feel the same as stress to me. I’m not worried about what the next thing may be. I’m worried about just other people. Not life in general. Basically just social and separation anxiety.;For some reason I always have this mindset of “everything will be okay, just go with the flow of lif;Need Support;1;4;2024-04-15 01:33:15;2024-04-15;Monday;01:33:15;1565;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 09:09:47.350908

1c49yh1;I messed up, I can't escape now.;Throwaway369783;"I screwed up. About one and a half years ago, I, (14m) had everything I wanted, every reason to live, and was what I would describe as ""happy"". And things were going well, until school started becoming a problem for me, specifically, the people there. I got bullied pretty bad, as well as one boy who really wanted to beat me up for seemingly no reason, and only failed because my friends helped me out. Overall, very stressful. But, I had friends, which is something very important to me, I need people around me, I'm definitely an introvert though, I'll explain further why I say need people later. So I left school at the end of that year, to be homeschooled, An easy solution, since I generally found being around people, even friends and family, very draining. So I homeschooled, and things were fine, up until about 6 months ago, when the problems began showing. They had always been there, just small and never enough to worry me. The main problem, was having too much mental space. Homeschool was not easier than regular school, but since I was efficient, I spent a far smaller amount of time doing school, while learning the same. I had also of course, sacrificed my friends to avoid the enemies. While having spare mental space might seem a good thing, it really wasn't and isn't for me. The spare space is chaos, always. Negative too, never thinking positively. With no people around me to fill my thoughts, my thoughts only think of the bad in the world, the terrible things happening every day. With all that going on in my head, I knew I had to block it somehow, I had to fill my mental space. So I started playing video games more, listening to music, and just occupying myself rather than just sitting feeling terrible. And this would be great, except for 2 things. 1. I have become very unfit and overall quite unhealthy, I don't eat enough. 2. The time the thinking issue is the worst is when I'm trying to sleep, so thats when I listen to music/game, which results in getting far too little sleep. Lack of sleep has caused physical exhaustion, but sadly, none of the mental variety. So I now physically don't have the energy to fix things, and can't get enough sleep to get energy. As a terrible side effect, I eat even less while tired, I almost have an aversion to food entirely for the first 4-5 hours of waking, so sometimes breakfast and lunch. Now all this abuse to my body, not caring for it at all, is finally catching up to me. I never feel well, can't stay awake during the day, unable to sleep at night, and don't complete the tasks expected of me. My mental health is terrible, I have no one to talk to about it, and I continue to bottle it up and leave it for myself to deal with at night, because im too exhausted in the moment. I can't make good decisions, and I can't handle the chaos in my mind, my own overthinking makes me want to end my own life, non-stop. I can't handle the pressure, from all angles. My siblings talk terrible about me all the time, and I don't have the energy or even care enough any more to defend myself. Im just done, I've had enough. I can't fix it, no one else can either. Exactly why this will join other posts in having 0 replies, idk if I even want one anymore, I'm either typing this to convince myself to commit suicide or to try to seek help, and I don't know which one at this point. Holidays end now, I have to keep functioning, succeeding, being the perfect child I act as, but I can't keep it up anymore, I just can't. It's over, my life is over, because I screwed it up, I started a snowball effect with one bad decision, and now I can't live with myself anymore, I'm done.TLDR: IDK how to summarise this, sorry if you don't have the time to read the whole thing, it's just a stupid rant anyway.";I screwed up.

Why do I have to beg for a Facebook post for my birthday while you do a post for everything my little brother do ? Are you okay daddy ? Why don’t you seek for help ?

Even with all of the anger I have inside of me I can’t help but I just want to hold you in my arms.

I love my dad ( I live in his house now) but I feel like he doesn’t understand me, I’m not waiting for a lot I don’t have a lot of expectations but I just want him to really understand where do I come from. I was the youngest with my mother, a glass child always in the shadows of my big brother, the rebellious child, the black sheep he thinks it’s not a lot but for me it was traumatic and I build my personality around this. I’m also angry at him because when I was younger when I needed him he was not there, he gave me the occasion to throw away my Father’s Day gift in tears because he didn’t come and pick me up, he didn’t come to my dance show after promising he would be there  and he wasn’t there to hug me when I was crying after him for years wondering what did I do for my daddy to abandon me. I remember praying every night wishing that he was okay. And then he build his life again with my step mom and my little brother, I felt so betrayed there’s no other words. Even now at 17 years old I still feel betrayed in the deepest part of my heart but I feel so guilty for feeling this way. When I came back in your life you pushed everything aside even your new family to take care of me but even you, you knew the time we had lost was lost forever and couldn’t be restored.

I was a bit uncomfortable but i reluctantly agreed thinking he’d still be gentle with it since i liked getting degraded and hit (but not beaten up way).I was so wrong. He started beating the fuck out of my breasts and slapping my face and didn’t stop for a good 30 mins even though i begged and cried for him to stop. he pulled my hair harshly and slapped so hard for crying that i felt like i had a concussion. even after that he didn’t stop.He twisted and pulled my nipples so hard that i could see visible skin coming off. my breasts had these HUGE green and purple and red bruising 60% covering them. after the incident i ghosted him and  we stopped talking for the good. So the thing with me is after anything traumatic happening with me i can snap back to normal very quick and live my life like i normally do till it starts affecting me in 6months or maybe a year.Now, i have been in an amazing relationship with this man for 6months and things are good. But slowly all those things i described earlier are coming back in my head. it is affecting my head so much like the disgust, guilt and shame i feel and i have started being scared of being intimate with my bf even though we do have an active sexual life. i cant bring this issue with him since he hates talking about my past and vice versa.i need help.also i dont have means to get therapy either. edit- sorry if it’s too long and English is not my first language either TvT;I will be putting nsfw warning and because it has SA content.

1c47yos;A Poem I Wrote: A Girl Named Ana;Desperate_Raccoon_;I met this girl. I'm going to call her Ana, since, you know, that's what everyone who's ever been close to her has called her. Ana and I go way back. For those who have never met her, let me tell you a little bit about her. Her name is Ana, she is tall and thin. She definitely likes pink more than any other color (but swears she's not picky). She likes to befriend the vulnerable and the ones who hate their body. She always likes to hang out in the gym more than the kitchen. And of course, she thinks that every girl wants to be her best friend and can never seem to understand when she says something hurtful. Since like 2019, I think. I was just about a sophomore in high school when she formally introduced herself to me. She helped me make my school's dance team that year and since then we've been practically inseparable. Ana and I were really close but she made me promise that there was no way that my parents could ever know about our relationship. They would want me to stop seeing her, and say that I was broken and I was sick, and that I needed help. So, Ana and I hung out in complete secrecy. We hung out at school, and at dance, and even went shopping together. The only problem was that I was hanging out with Ana so much that I never had the time nor energy to hang out with my other friends. But still, I wouldn't – I mean I couldn't tell my parents about Ana. In 2020, I unfortunately had an accident and ended up in a special kind of hospital, and of course Ana had to come along. She made me feel safe when nothing else did. During my one month at the 'special' hospital, my relationship only grew stronger with Ana. But, all of my nurses and all of my doctors kept insisting that Ana didn't hang out with people that looked like me. They tried telling me that Ana didn't want me and didn't like people like me, but Ana just squeezed my hands even tighter. Of course, she's my best friend. Ana's not picky. Ana likes those she can control. Those who fear letting her down. Ana definitely chose me. The only problem is Ana tried to kill me. She made me sick and made me weak. And she held on as long as she could. But I'm finally ready to end my 6 year relationship with her. There's a better friend I've found. Her name is Recovery.;I met this girl.

1c47ows;Out of abusive relationship for just shy of two years. TWs: Abuse and Suicide;BeaByte;"I was in an extremely mentally and emotionally abusive relationship for about a year. I’ve thought for about a year that I was completely over the abuse, my ex-partner, and just everything surrounding this. This relationship at it’s worst involved talking them down from suicide, daily for months. Sleep deprevation from the prior. Bounderies would be respected… at first for about a day or two until things would slide, one by one until the boundary was gone. I had to screenshare my devices randomly and frequently, I can only assume this was to monitor who and what I was talking to people about. I was told lies about all my friends at the time, spoonfed lies about my family. This broke down basically all my outside relationships.I was at a support group (which is unrelated to this abuse). At one point the topic of relationships came up. I haven’t really spoken to anyone about this since it first happened, obviously it occasionally comes up but nothing in-depth or great detail. I managed to say about two short sentances, and I just fucking froze. This emotion just overcame me, it just felt like I was right back in that relationship all over again. The sheer fear I felt in that moment, because I realised just how much power they still have over me, and that my reality was entirely shaped by them for a year, I thought this shit was normal, this feeling is just so overwhelming.  It really makes me wonder how much of my other problems; low self-esteem, lack of self-respect, self-hatred and trust issues stem from this. I don’t really know what the point of this post is but holy shit.

But when I move the waters beat against it and I feel my thoughts wash away like sand, eroded and impermanent and insignificant in the face of a greater power.  I wish that I was a purely cerebral being; that my body was simply a way to get from point A to B - a vehicle that I keep clean, and repaired, and fed. But more and more I find myself dominated by my body, not my mind.

I cannot begin to express how difficult it is to even understand him. (1) He does not know the right words to say (he pronounces ""effort"" like ""otter""), his words overlap (he might say ""hwhent"" when he means ""he went""), sometimes his face does not move at all when he talks and sometimes his face is on overdrive with visual cues when he talks. However, he is a brilliant programmer. He's had an extremely difficult time finding a job - but he seems to find start-ups that will tolerate his conversational difficulties because he has a very strong github/profolio.At his last job a female co-worker showed him even a modest amount of friendliness. She would sit with him at work-conventions, she would ask for his help with her projects/assignments, they would work together on cooperative projects. In late 2023, he learned that she is seeing someone. He interpreted her friendliness as a crush and when he said something to her she said that she does not see him as anything more than a co-worker. Around the same time, due to unrelated events, she was fired (from what I understand because the company was a start-up) and in a show of solidarity - my friend quit his job as a response to her being fired. His boss was very patient and tried to talk him out of quitting but that did not work.It has been over 9 months and my friend has not gotten over her. He learned a programming language that she worked on, just because he hoped that she would find his github on want to work on projects together. My friend has discovered AI generated content - and is using AI to write love letters to her - he has posted them on his twitter and github (seriously) - his personal website for job searching has his twitter feed and these are visible on his personal website. My friend went silent for a month or two, I thought he went to Taiwan - but instead his father confiscated his computer for two months because he thought he was possessed by a 'devil'. (his mother is deceased)I am going to be direct: I have seen middle schoolers behave better with one-sided relationships than my friend. I am genuinely worried he is going to stalk her - his behavior has gotten a lot worse in last two weeks. He updated his github 56 times one day with various relationship like things. For example, he is making AI-generated 'peach and goma'like images with the cats being in a relationship (seriously!) - and is still posting love letters (the most recent one was ""I knew you love me despite our arguments"" [in md5 encryption]). He sometimes, includes her name in these love letters and 'memes' so I know these are directed to her. I do not know what to to do. I have tried, repeatedly, to help him engage in constructive projects and try to cheer him up.

1c47gmt;No friends🤷🏻‍♂️;Mediocre_Ticket_6478;Hey guys, i have had this feeling for almost 5 weeks i feel like im not wanted among my friends i haven't really talked with them in group chat for like a week i only send few messages like good morning and stuff like this, not only i feel not wanted among my friends but with my family too i think I'm a huge let down for them, it all started 5 weeks ago when i had this new friend from school he really changed me he made me quit almost all of my bad habits and we used to go to the library and books and read them i really loved him more than my other friends (who i have known them for 5 years) and i only became a friend with him for few months, oh and when i talk to him i feel that he kinda understands me unlike me other friends who were just joking and playing around he was open for me and so was i, so one day he was really mentally let down so he asked me if i wanted to go to the library with him,i agreed and then we went to the library, after we finished from the library he told me that someone from school was hurting him and sending people after him and making rumors about, at first he didn't tell me who it was he just told me (he's one of our close friends) and i knew how it was but I didn't give him the name but reason of why that person made rumors its because of jealousy, anyway after we got home he took his bike and before he left i told him (let's end our friendship because if we stay more together that person will hurt you more) he said (no i won't leave you) and his eyes were red and tearing so i said (let's pretend that we ended our friendship) he didn't agree at first but we nothing to do so he went on his bike to his house, after i got into my house i felt something odd something weird i felt something bad happened to him i tried to text and call but there was no response i couldn't sleep that night worrying that something bad happened to him, next morning he texted me and i was right a car had hit him it was a hit and run, as soon as i seen his message i broke down into tears my eyes flooded with tears u cried like i have never cried before and i have been like this since the accident to this day for 5 miserable weeks crying and praying for him and i blamed myself for what happened to him i couldn't face my family because if open my mouth i would cry for hours and hours so i didn't speek to them for a week and they weren't really interested on what's going on with me, so then i went to my old friends and they really weren't the people that you want to be open with they're just here to joke and make a laugh of anything, which made my mental health worse i couldn't tell which friends should i stay with with my new friend who i have known him for months or my old friends who i have known them for 5 years, at the end i feel both sides don't want me which made me cry more and more, I am spending most of my time right now between reading and studying and sometimes crying🤷🏻‍♂️Sorry for the huge story it's my first time sharing my feelings with others🙏🏼;Hey guys, i have had this feeling for almost 5 weeks i feel like im not wanted among my friends i ha;Need Support;4;2;2024-04-14 23:26:28;2024-04-14;Sunday;23:26:28;3013;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 09:09:47.376862
1c47edz;Tips for feeling like everyone dislikes me?;ItsFiiiiiine;I recently got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and now I want to try and make some more active effort to be managing my issues so I can have a healthier mindset. In the past year or so I’ve been dealing with anxiety around what people think of me, strangers and friends. I worry that everyone I interact with doesn’t really like me and I seem to always be trying to convince myself that I’m right and then turn around and convince myself I’m wrong. I don’t want to be doing this because it hurts the way that I socialize, it hurts my relationships and my own self image, and I think it’s just generally unhealthy and really stresses me out.

1c474um;How to end a very new and quite worrying friendship?;MiserableLobster8897;Using a throwaway because I’m concerned that if this guy finds out I feel this way it might be detrimental to him. I’ve obviously taken out all the identifying details for the same reason. It’s going to be a long one. So my friend A and I met at a social club, and I recently met her boyfriend B as well. A couple of days ago I told A about a mental health charity which has helped me and she said that her friend C might benefit from it as well, and asked me to send her the details. She said that, like me, C is transgender, autistic/neurodiverse (I forget the exact word she used, and has been in the care system. I sent her the details the next evening and she asked if she could give C my number because it might help him to have a friend with some of the same experiences. I try to avoid relationships based on shared trauma because there’s a risk of them turning unhealthy, but it sounded like we had some common interests, so I said sure. He texted me a few hours later at 1am and said he’d like to come to the charity project. I said that it might take a while for him to become a member, but that he could come to a community centre type place where I and some of my other friends hang out instead. He said he’d like to come. He warned me that he has selective mutism and either talks too much or not at all, and I said that’s fine. He also said that he’s a furry and always wears animal ears (his name is the name of the animal he dresses as) and asked if he’d be judged for that, and I said probably not. Yesterday I texted C saying there was a craft activity group on at the community centre, and he said he’d get B to take him. My friend D was in charge and so I told him about C and to be nice to him. C got there maybe an hour later and D and I introduced ourselves. C seemed really nervous and quiet, and since he said he has selective mutism I assumed he’d get stressed out answering questions in front of new people (there were three other people there besides D and myself) so I didn’t ask him anything directly, which in hindsight I think may have made him feel left out. A few minutes later he got up and left, and after a while D asked if I’d seen him. I said no and did a quick search of the building, then texted C to ask if he was okay, but got no reply. Then D told me that somebody had reported that there was screaming coming from the ladies’ toilets. I called C and immediately heard growling/roaring, but that turned out to be his answerphone message. Then D started getting visibly nervous and told me to go and check on him. I felt weird going into the ladies’ toilets and I’ve also had traumatic experiences in care/hospital where I saw other residents hurting themselves, so this was not fun for me. I went into the toilets and heard C crying. I asked if he was okay, and he said he was overwhelmed and would rather be left alone. I left and texted A saying that C was having some kind of episode and was there anything I should do. She implied that this happens a lot and told me that she and B were on the phone with him (that’s who he was screaming at/to). After about fifteen minutes, D told me to check on C again and said that he was worried he might hurt himself. D told me that he would use his own money to pay for a taxi to get C home safe. I went back into the toilets and talked to C, but he refused the taxi and said that he wanted B to pick him up. I think B was busy with studying or something (he’s a medical student) and couldn’t be there right away.A and B arrived maybe another fifteen minutes later, by which time C had come out of the bathroom and was calmer, but was still visibly upset and shaking. He told me that he’s agoraphobic and apologised for melting down, to which I said that it’s fine. A, B, C, D and I talked for a while, and C and D got on quite well because they both like really extreme horror movies (think A Serbian Film or Salo), but C and I had basically nothing in common apart from very superficial things like being transgender. After a while, C started getting nervous again and A and B took him home. Once they were home, A texted me saying that she understands if I don’t want to hang out with C again but that he’d really like to be my friend. Obviously I did not enjoy hanging out with him and would rather not do it again, but I didn’t want to say that because I know that it would upset C. I told her very diplomatically that I’d like to hang out with him again, but only in a group setting where I’m not the one responsible for his welfare. She said that he would never be scream at me, and that when he gets upset he phones B, but that’s not really the issue for me. It’s more just that the whole experience was really more than I could comfortably deal with. I would have liked a warning from A that C frequently has meltdowns like this, but that I shouldn’t be worried because he doesn’t actually hurt himself. Then C texted me saying that he’d like to come to the community centre soon to watch a movie that’s on. I hinted that maybe he’d like to bring a friend, but he said that his only friends are A and B (by the way, I have no further information about how he met B or how the relationship works). I said that B seems like the kind of person who would like that movie, but C said he isn’t. I really want to avoid interacting with C alone again, because it was extremely stressful. The way he behaves reminds me a bit of myself a few years ago when I was very unwell, and that’s upsetting for me. I still struggle to keep my own issues under control sometimes, and I just don’t have the skills to deal with somebody else’s. There’s also the issue that it was stressful for D and a couple of other people at the centre. I don’t want them to be in that position, since many people at the centre also have autism, a learning disability or a mental health issue. Since I was the only person who knew C (for less than 12 hours at that point), they expected me to check on him and sort everything out. Some of the people there have absolutely no tact, and since C dresses up in animal ears and uses gore/goreself pronouns as well as he/him, I know that if he continues to come, somebody will say something insensitive at some point and I’ll be responsible. Also, I don’t want to accidentally end up playing the same role in C’s life as B. Maybe if we had more in common I’d want to spend a lot of time with him, but as it is I don’t want to. C seems to be extremely dependent on B, and there are already a few signs that maybe C struggles with boundaries (texting me late at night, etc). I don’t want to set a precedent that I’m capable of providing C with support, and since he said he has no other friends I’m concerned that he might ask me to support him when A and B are unavailable. I’d rather avoid forming a relationship with him that might make him turn to me for help.All of this makes me feel like a terrible, selfish person. I know that I shouldn’t shun a person for their mental health issues, and have felt hurt in the past when others have shunned me for mine. The way I’ve reacted to C has made me realise how much everybody probably dreaded my company when I was at my most unwell, and it’s just not a nice thing to think about. Nothing about this whole experience has been at all fun or even tolerable for me, and I’m dreading a repeat of it. What I want to know is how to let C down gently. He seems extremely delicate and I don’t want to make his situation worse. I also don’t want A or B to think I’m a bad person. I really struggle with setting clear boundaries and don’t know what to do. TLDR: a friend of a friend with very obvious emotional issues wants to hang out with me but the whole thing stresses me out.;Using a throwaway because I’m concerned that if this guy finds out I feel this way it might be detri;Question;0;1;2024-04-14 23:11:17;2024-04-14;Sunday;23:11:17;7724;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 21:04:55.793412

Looking back it must've been so, scary to watch me devolve and spiral to someone unrecognizable to her, and I know it's not my fault and my meds heavily contributed to it but, I still feel responsible I'm so tired of fronting that I hate her, I don't I love her so much and if I could just, talk to her once about everything I think l'd finally be able to let go, or maybe recover. We were so happy we had this connection like we just understood everything without words being said but even with that kind of connection proper communication is needed. I rushed into things with her which is on me.

From October until early February I was getting bullied and harassed in school which made me decide to move forms. I'm now in a new class and barely see those people. My class is nice to me, I have friends but I'm still so utterly miserable and exhausted all of the time.A little while after I moved into my new class I started to feel completely empty inside. It's like all of my dreams and ambitions disappeared. I self harmed later that day. I had done it once before in December when shit really hit the fan for me but I tried to stop myself from doing it. I feel somewhat happy when I self harm, it's a surprisingly calming feeling for me. That is until I realised what I had done and was overcome by guilt. I never told anybody. My friends worry too much and my relationship with my parents would be at risk in my opinion. After I started to adjust to my new class, things started to get better. However I am now experiencing that same empty feeling. Tomorrow is my first day back from break so it might just be an irrational fear of school. I have the overwhelming urge to hurt myself, it's like you want to lock yourself into a sound proof room and scream until your vocal cords get shredded. I feel like I don't spend enough time with my family but if I dedicate more of my time to them then I don't feel like I study enough. The concept of death feels welcoming at this point.

1c4675b;Living situation between my mother and abusive and mentally disabled father.;WaffleSpank;"This is a lot to unfold, and I really thank anyone who takes the time to read this and give me guidance, because I am at wits end. My mother has been married to my father for over 35 years, but over the past 3 years he has been having progressive presentation of dementia with depression/anxiety and it has been significantly affecting my mothers life. Before this all happened, right before the COVID lockdown, my father was a very successful business man, very personable and reasonable, although a little bit full of himself. As of now, he is a completely different person. Now my father can completely take care of himself regarding to regular activities of daily living (bathing, changing, cooking, cleaning), but does not have the capacity to go shopping or go to doctors appointments on his own and relies on my mother for that. This wouldn’t be such a big deal for my mother, as she really is a saint, but as a result of his mental decline, he had recently been more and more aggressive towards my mother. He will have almost biweekly episodes where he will have a mental breakdown over something like my mom not wanting to watch TV with him, or talking on the phone to me or my sister (which is the strangest thing to me), and he will steal her phone, physically hit and shove her, and try to prevent her from leaving the home. Despite him being mentally disabled, he is a massive 6 foot 6 and can physically dominate my mother if he wanted to. The police have been called multiple times for these episodes which de-escalates things immediately, and incredibly enough my father, when he wants to, can make it seem like he’s completely normal when talking to other people, like police/ doctors, but is in a constant anxiety-ridden, whiny, childlike state when with my mother. He has been assessed by psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, is on medications (that don’t seem to help much despite many attempts at different med regimens), and the only real physiological explanation for his complete change in personality was shown on an MRI revealing frontal-temporal atrophy of his brain (likely dementia). My father really has not been the best Husband to my mother, he had multiple affairs and has been verbally abusive in the past (never physical). However with his current condition he can no longer drive or work and is just cooped up at their home which they both own. They do not have any other properties, nor does my father have another place to go. But my mom is losing her mind. She is taking care of someone who at the flip of a switch, can just ruin her day and harm her. We are trying to figure out the best way to move forward. Without my father’s income my parents don’t have a wealth of financial resources. My mother wants to live apart from him but we can’t figure out how to make that work financially and in a way that he will be safe as well. I currently live out of state with my fiancé, and have been dealing with all of this remotely. I will be moving back this year living fairly close to my parents, which I think will help my mother slightly, but isn’t a solution. TLDR; Mother wants to move out away from my abusive mentally-disabled father, but has limited financial resources, and unsure of most humane way to get my father the support he needs without the help of my mother.";This is a lot to unfold, and I really thank anyone who takes the time to read this and give me guida;Opinion / Thoughts;0;1;2024-04-14 22:29:04;2024-04-14;Sunday;22:29:04;3319;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-18 09:09:47.381747

My mom found out & took me off her health insurance. The meds weren’t working anyway but still like wtf. So 17 no health insurance psychiatrist or therapist. Then one day at school a guy gave me  this tan rectangular pill. From that one pill it felt like someone pulled a gun on me and robbed me of my anxiety. For years i went to doctors back & forth to get adequate mental health care. One day my aunt took me to an inpatient program to get help because I was in a really bad place. When I got out, I went to CVS to pick up my prescription of Klonopin. They prescribe me and on my way home. I got shot. The police took the  Klonopin out my car, but left the  ssri’s. Since then, I’ve tried so hard to get out going to different psychiatrist, different healthcare providers and honestly just I feel like you know me being black. I just never got adequate care. So I started self medicating and my life improved and now I found ketamine and that helps even more but what I’m trying to say is am I wrong for self-medicating when I feel like no one will help me or even cares?PS when I was 18 l had my first panic attack.

My father is currently in treatment at a clinic and people have been asking my family where he is and stuff.

As you may understand my father is absent and wont be able to attend, this is rising questions and I really don't know how to answer truthfully. I don't wanna lie at the same time I don't wanna be honest since it would give my family a bad name. I know it may sound harsh or something if you are from a different culture and this is mainly just the old generation who thinks like that.

1c453ut;I have no interest in anything anymore;Coffeepanda09;At one time, I used to get excited about things and also become a little obsessed with current interests. I had hobbies and enjoyed them, like finding new things to be interested in. I went through a separation a few years ago and my life has been in a liminal space since then. Been in an in between living space but still working full time and content with work. The last few years I've slowly begun to lose interest in anything. Things I was interested in before fail to hold my attention at all anymore. No interest in finding anything new to get into. Ever since I was teenager/young adult, I've always developed crushes and admired certain men. I've recently started dating someone (about 9 months in now) and although I do love him, sometimes I feel low interest in him or the relationship in general and it's not him, he's wonderful to me. It's just another thing that compiles this recent feeling of lack of interest in anything. I'm not suicidal but I have no energy or conviction to be interested in anything anymore. Is this depression or a hormonal imbalance? I'm not sure how to fix this or try when in reality I can't muster the dedication to do things that have the potential to better my life (eating better, exercising, good habit building, etc). Has anyone else experienced this slow decline of interest in anything? What chemicals will help me get that back and how do I achieve those chemicals? Any advice or help is appreciated. ETA: this also includes food. I love food and I love baking but I'm not really excited about desserts anymore or certain foods.

I experienced a couple traumatic events when I was about 4/5, and then another big one around 13, when my depression, anxiety and OCD started.My parents were of the thoughts that you don't talk about those things because you don't want to be labeled. So I didn't for many years. But eventually I did seek counseling. However, I haven't found any counselors/therapists that have actually helped, and here I am approaching 35, 4 kids of my own, and a poor husband who bears the weight of these struggles. I currently have a therapist as I am off work on stress leave, and in a ""Mental Health Crisis"" However our last session ended and I spent about an hour hard crying Because the session was so bad. She was very distracted and not very helpful. I'm really starting to feel like therapy isn't worth it. Meds don't seem to help, the depression always finds a way around them.

1c44ta3;I Just Don’t Know;Southern-Level2385;For an entire year my gf(20) and I (21), have been fighting. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and have tried different meds which have helped with ADHD, but never helped with my problems in our relationship. I constantly unknowingly say or do dumb things that hurt her. I never do it on purpose and I love her with all my heart, but I just don’t know how to change. I don’t know what it is, but I can’t understand anything. Whenever her and I talk, it makes sense to me, but I can never actually process it. It’s like I’m listening and able to understand, but I can’t actually fully comprehend and internalize it. It sounds stupid and insane, but that’s just what it feels like. It’s not one with her either, I can’t even actually interpret my own emotions. I cry and can never actually understand what made me cry. I always just assume it’s ADHD mood swings, but it’s more than that.For example: my gf was telling me that I need to change and just stop saying and doing the stupid things I do (this is my wording, not hers). I completely agree with what she was saying, that she can’t handle another year of me saying and doing the dumb small mistakes, cause it has been driving her insane and makes her doubt that I love her. It all makes sense, but I can’t internalize that and figure out a solution for myself. I constantly feel lost in emotions and the only things that help is reassurance, music, and just doing things to distract myself. I constantly feel like my emotions just come and go. I’ll be sad, basically heartbroken, about one thing then 5 minutes later I’m not sad anymore. I just don’t understand what’s happening. I’ve been thinking I have autism but everytime I’ve brought it up (twice) to a psychologist it’s been impossible to explain how I even feel. I want her, I love her, but my mind is so full and so empty at the same time. I don’t know what’s going on with me. I don’t want pity or anyone to tell me “there’s nothing wrong with you, you’re just struggling rn” or whatever, I just want answers on what to do or what I’m even feeling.

1c44bcq;I feel like talking makes things worse;k4nenas;"Hello, I would like to tell you a little about myself; I'm anon, I'm in my early 20s, I'm generally a person who can cope with life, I've been working and persist myself since I was 16, I have ADHD. I don't consider myself the most responsible person in the world, but as I gain more life experience, I'm doing better and better in terms of work, money, etc. However, an invariable factor in my experience is that when it comes to emotional, internal problems and matters surrounding them, I can`t fully solve them. I turned to psychologists and psychiatrists, psychologists only made things worse and medications do not help at all, I stopped taking them a long time ago.  I feel that every time I want to open up about my problems, I am not listened to or understood. I feel that when I start talking, the problem grows, becomes bigger and more dangerous, slowly taking away my control over myself. I'm turning into a mindless machine. Do the work, come home, do the chores, go to sleep, repeat and pray that I won't find time to think.there are several problems that come back from time to time, usually when one appears I start thinking about the others;a) Feeling of beeing unloved - (boy oh boy I m sure that this is related to my childhood) I have gf we have been together for couple of years. The problem is we have Anxious-Avoidant Relationship. I dont want to enforce anything, I  can see that even if I would try change anything it just won`t happen. So many times when my need for closeness comes up I m left alone. It hurts and I left with feeling that I deserve to suffer. I think that it`s matter of time and she will leave me. I think that I cant change it and this feeling makes me want to end it. But at the same time, I love her. So much.b) Inability to stick to one thing - in most other cases surrounding my life I just can`t stick to any one thing, I m constantly trying new things and often I abandon   previous things. Good thing is that I m a fast learner. I have been playing guitar for some time going in with a tryhard mindset training every day, thinking what I can do to improve how music works why something sound good and how I can insert my feelings into music. But every couple months I m dropping this hobby, forgeting about it for some time. Bcz of that my progress is slowed down. If I remained and never ditched this hobby I would be much much much better guitarist right now. The thing is that I m every time I do this I m investing time and effort into something else, I get good at what I m doing then I ditch it. I have tried beeing a speedruner, I have played some games on pretty high competetive level etc. I m not achiving anything spinning around not beeing able to decide what I should do.c) Not beeing able to decide what I should do - and here we go the part when I m feeling rage at myself. The part where I m losing my sanity and the part when I want to scream. I don`t know if I should talk about anything with anyone I dont know if I should stay in my relationship. I dont know if I stay in my current job. I dont know if I should keep going with my hobby. I dont know how to decide, how to choose.sorry for the length of the post here is TLDR; anon, young 20s, feeling like he can't talk about his feelings. in a relationship in which he feels that he will probably be abandoned.

1c43yxo;The general approach to Psychiatric/Phycological (psychosocial) first-aid!;Qmeieriet;"The general approach: Psychiatric (psychosocial) first-aid is extremely important, and there are some steps you follow:(1. Assess the situation  - As soon as possible, you must check your surroundings for dangers to your own safety and that of others and take preventative measures to ensure that you remain safe, this includes contacting your local EMSDo not hang up on EMS unless they tell you to and give EMS feedback as you go along, as well as rely on them for guidance if you are unsure. EMS is your best friend in any healthcare emergency, use them for what they are worth. It might sound egoistic but it's important that you as a caregiver are safe so you can provide the assistance and help needed without the danger of being harmed.(2. Contact and engagement talk to the patient in a non-confronting manner and actively listen to them, do not try to argue against them as that can escalate their frustration. Instead try to understand that they could be in acute distress; worried; psychotic/delusional or scared (depending on what the crisis is). If you come off as confrontive or judgmental the patient can quickly become defensive and reluctant to assistance/treatment, or become hostile and potentially a danger to themselves or others (such as the first-aider trying to help them).(3.  Safety and comfort respect, patience, and understanding are needed. Make sure they are in a safe environment where they feel comfortable, if possible stay with them and try to be comforting by showing them that you're there and they are being taken care of and aren't in any danger. Do not restrain them, you quickly run the risk of harming them; yourself and/or causing them to become hostile, let the proper personnel restrain them (e.g Police)(4. Stabilization use distraction techniques, such as talking with them about their interests; hobbies; have them tell you a story or engage in other topics that take the focus away from the crisis.(5. Information gathering get as much information about their condition as possible, pay attention to their mood and behaviour (this could be important for EMS and should be relayed back to your local EMS). If there are other people present who know the patient you can ask if the patient is known to have the symptoms/crisis and if they have a treatment plan or use any medication (DO NOT give any medications without being explicitly told so by qualified healthcare personnel, which rarely, if ever, happens).(6. Practical assistance help them if there's anything they need or if they struggle with obtaining their basic needs. Provide physical and emotional stability, and offer practical assistance, such as: giving them water if thirsty; blanket if they are cold; or other practical help that can make them more comfortable.(7. Connections reach out to those you believe can help them, for example: ask if there is anyone they would like for you to call/reach out to, such as: family; friends; or others who they feel confident in and that will be supportive. Be mindful about who you involve as they need to be able to de-escalate and not provoke them, this includes those around you; unless there is someone who is either trained in psychosocial first-aid or personally knows the patient, then having them leave the scene is your go-to. The fewer people (bystanders) the better, it’s a high pressure situation for both the patient and you as care-giver, and having bystanders is not only a distraction but can be potentially aggravating for the patient (This goes back to point 1. Assessing the situation and taking preventative measures to ensure everyone's safety. As well as point 3. Safety and comfort, having a lot of people around may be distressing).Remember that you as a psychosocial first-aider is not a therapist, nor is it your job to act as one or try to treat them beyond your capabilities (this includes not assuming diagnoses; suggesting path of treatment; or suggest medication). As mentioned: It can make it difficult for EMS and the eventual therapist/treatment team to work with them if you have created expectations or made promises.";The general approach: Psychiatric (psychosocial) first-aid is extremely important, and there are som;Resources;0;1;2024-04-14 20:53:50;2024-04-14;Sunday;20:53:50;4106;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:54.569631

1c43r3j;How can I start studying again with my depression?;Antique_Mimi_123;So I am 17 and I have been dealing with depression for  the last three years and developed anxiety last year after the finals exam last year I was in grade 10 and moved to the igcse system which was new and very tiering it felt Like I was an employee and I have a very bad lack of concentration from depression and also I sleep a lot and don’t feel awake even after sleeping a lot so I cried silently in classes and thought to myself am I that stupid? am i mentally retarded or something? I hated that. and I was taking private  maths online lessons and the teacher that my mom knew his class is two times a week and each time he would give us from 50 to 70 pages homework each and I must be done and sent before the deadline and he wasn’t really sutible for me  because he speaks so fast and I need time to understand or get what he was saying I once told him that and he told me and why is that ? like he was expecting me to tell him that I have some type of problem and after finishing each unit he would examen us and then after a week the papers will be sent to the student and the teacher will take his time yelling to each person  we were like 8 for what they got wrong in the exam and thank god that was online cause I would be crying  and every class that I entered with him I would be  always worried and thinking when will he yell at me even when I do absolutely nothing wrong and after the lesson finishes I felt relieved cause something I feared didn’t happen it was very bad I was anxious all the time and afraid of him so I was taking five subject French which I didn’t study cause I was in a French school all my life before transferring, English I  didn’t study  it but did all the homeworks and they were a lot and every two weeks  the whole year we would have a speaking exam that we have to prepare to i was also taking bio ol and the teacher in school was a nice person but understood nothing from him and lastly chemistry anyway so math was taking all my time so I would be so tired of studying something else and the most frustrating thing is that the math teacher told me because I didn’t do the homework mostly correct told me to  leave time for math since i am  not good at it like what do you want me to do anyway i got an a star in English and French  didn’t study them you think i would be happy? no i wasn’t at all causeI failed 2 subjects chem and biology and barely passed one even though it was the only one that I have been studying it was maths  why because I didn’t study the whole year and  before the exams I stoped studying anything even maths but I was attending private bio and maths revision didn’t help at all and they were expensive and quit my old maths teacher because I couldn’t take it anymore and the month and half during the exams I had an intense depressive episode and didn’t study for maths even thought I got the chance a week before each of the two exam but I couldn’t and I was crying a lot like daily and wondring why I am like this ? I knew why because I had very hight expectations for myself since this is the only subject that I did study the whole year so from the stress my body seemed to have shut down  and I took an easy subject to study in the summer to get high grades since I developed also anxiety after what happened with the maths  I tried to study hard but I couldn’t I got B I mean at least I didn’t fail anyway started year 11 after finishing the november exams right away and now I am taking as biology and physics and global perspectives ( a subject for doing research) and also i didn’t study the whole year and now the finals exams have 23 days left and my psychiatrist did put me on the maximum dose of a medication for both anxiety and depression so now don’t feel anxiety and depression episodes as intense but I don’t study maybe I am not anxious now and it may be because I am used to do nothing all the time because I was stressed but now I am not really that stressed so I need to get good grades in these subjects and the time is very short. I feel sometimes like even if I passed got into college or after it got a job I will never be free, free from the feeling that I have the stress of the whole world over my head or will never be happy or that why even try from the beginning cause you’re stupid and a failure.

1c43q6k;Need Advice. Friend is causing my depression?;Good_Ad5625;Hi everyone,    This is my first time posting on reddit with this kind of topic so please be patient with me.    So I am 25 years old. Growing up, I never had depression as bad as I had it starting back in Summer of 2023. I had anxiety and the occasional getting I guess what I would call just “Sad”.    Back in the summer of 2023 I became close with a co-worker of mine, we will name him Sean. Sean is straight and I am gay. To make a long story short, I developed feelings for Sean, always feelings, never any sexual feelings. I never told him at the time but Sean, another friend Tom and myself would talk a lot at work since we worked nights and had nothing else to do on our down time. I started comparing myself to Sean a lot, the fact that he was straight, I thought at one point I may have been bi-sexual (Which I think I may still be but Idk), the fact that he has a GF, I tried looking for a Girlfriend or boyfriend 24 hours a day, he has a beach house, I started looking at apts to move into and out of my parents house, etc. Sean would always make comments to me about being gay. If I said something too hyped up he would say “Wow the way you just said that is so Gay”, or when he came over to my apartment and saw I had a Disney picture hanging on the wall he would say “That picture is so gay”. This fucked with me mentally because I felt like I again was comparing myself to him and was trying to change myself to avoid those comments. Our job is very stressful, we work in public safety. How we joke around is with deep dark humor, and making fun of eachother, which I never ever had issues with, I myself would make homophobic jokes, etc. For some reason, when he entered my life these things really fucked with my head. Back in July of 2023 I got so bad I didn’t leave my bead for over 20 something hours because, at the time I felt sad, now looking bad it was the start of my depression setting in.    I would like to add I knew him about 6 months prior to hanging out with him outside of work, these feelings only started when I hung out with him outside of work and MET HIS GIRLFRIEND. I maybe got a little jealous of her. It’s funny, when he first got hired I got the ick and was like he's gross, but I guess someone with a good personality does something to you…    Ok, so now that is covered let’s fast forward to October of 2023. Me not telling him that I had feelings for him was eating me alive. I never went into it expecting him to say he had feelings too, despite the subtle cues I was picking up, like him calling me his “bitch” and what is mine is his when it came to stuff I owned, or him asking me to wash his dish at work because again, “I'm his bitch”. It was also fucking with my head when he would talking about his Girlfriend, him and her are not like a normal relationship. He would always say how he is only going to propose to her when she gets a job that makes more money than him, etc. (It’s more on the joking side but still to me that is kinda fucked up with the stuff he would say). There is one point a few weeks ago I said something about weight and he said “yea well we are the same weight but you have man boobs and a gut”). That broke me, I started acting differently, when he said that on the phone I acted like someone else was calling me and went home and did not eat the whole day. I know how to fix it, to work out which I am doing but that something about how he said it broke me a little. It’s hard to get away from this as I tried to back away in the past and he has asked me why am I giving him the cold shoulder or being different. It’s hard when it’s someone you work with for 12 hours a day 4 days a week. I have never had any of these depression feelings, until I met him. Is this what a toxic friendship is? I’m not sure. Back in November of 2023 I had to tell him. I told him I had feelings for him, and confirmed that those feelings are not longer active (which at the time it wasn’t but I guess they slowly creeped back in). He took the information and I thought he would banish me and not talk to me which was my biggest fear, but he said to give him some time. Fast forward to now, it’s like I never told him anything. Me and him are still close as we were and talk. The only person that knows all of this is my closest work friend, we will call her Julie.    I just feel like at this point it’s a revolving door. I get these waves and they come and go. I got a few days of severe deep depression and my head gets very, very dark, and then within a matter of an hour I flip back and am Ok. It’s maybe to the point I need medication. Back in August when all of this started I noticed it and started seeing someone and doing weekly and bi weekly therapy but I feel as if I can’t talk about my real thoughts in the session as they will try to commit to me. My depression stems from me hating myself so much. For being Gay and allowing myself to develop feelings for straight guys and getting myself into this mental space. The whole maybe being Bi is something that has always been a thing, I went from HS, to working at one job where I didn’t come out as gay to my current job where I came out as gay to a few people, not now almost everyone knows. So part of me is like did I rush into being gay? I am sexually attracted to men, and have thoughts about sex with women, but it’s weird, I get the ick of being in a relationship with a male, but not a female Crazy… right. I can’t pinpoint if it’s just me trying to compare myself to him and others or if it’s a true feeling… guess there's only one way to find out, right? Keep in mind, I never really came out to my parents, I mentioned to my mom when I was younger I liked guys but I never really said “Hey I’m gay”, and they always say “When are you going to get a boyfriend/ girlfriend”.    Ok, this is the end of my rant, thank you for listening, I just need to get this on paper and get it out there.    Thoughts?

The only thing that fixes it is sleep, but I also suffer from sleep issues and anxiety. I don’t know what to do. I’m writing this out of complete despair as this has been going on for 20 years.

I have a long history of depression, I visit a Psychiatric nurse weekly and eat maximum dose of SSRI medication. Otherwise I am healthy and in good shape. My problem is that every little task such as brushing my teeth, taking a walk, making food, showering and changing the sheets etc. Are SO EXHAUSTING, in a mental way. For example I might go days without eating a warm meal because I just hate the process of making food, even spreading butter on a bread takes too much mental power from me, so I eat dry bread. I don't understand what is weong with me? I am generally a pretty happy person and find ALOT of comfort and joy in video games and watching series. If I had friends, I would definitely hang out with them! I like talking to people and social events, but I rarely have an opportunity for those. I am tired when I wake up and when I go to sleep. My question is: Why are the simplest tasks so overwhelming? I just procrastinate and get nothing done, even if it something I really want to do, for example drawing a picture Ive wanted to draw for so long. Am I lazy?;Hello!

1c41cou;So frustrated and sad, and I really need to vent somewhere...;Laviniya;So, I've been in this relationship for around 17 years. We've argued and stuff a lot over the years. We realized that I had since mental health problems a few years back and I've been trying to get help and get diagnosed since then. There are a lot of problems but the main one has always been my frustrations with things and my problem to regulate how angry I get. Among since other things.We've tried so many things to get it to stop. We've talked, taken pills, seen doctors, everything. But it's just recently we kind of understood where the frustration and stuff comes from. I'm probably autistic and have borderline.We've realized that I've had really huge problems with understanding stuff during my life and problem with learning lots of stuff people need to cope and function. I having a really hard time picking up the positive and his things life offers and have rarely grown from any event. My mental state seems to still be around teenage years although I am highly functioning. The frustrations and arguments has really taken a toll on my ex and me but we're still trying to fix anything between us to at least be friends. Lately, last few months we've been trying to get me to remember lots of the bad stuff I've done and said to try and learn from it. I'm really trying my hardest but I'm so frustrated. I've never felt this bad in my life and I still can't change my frustration. Its worse than ever. And my ex keeps telling me all the bad things over and over again. I get it, I need to hear it but by now it's driving me crazy. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to learn, grow and be better. I really do. I hate feeling and acting like this. But hearing what I've done is killing me and not helping in the slightest.I'm gonna contact a psychiatrist tomorrow and take things from there but I'm so frustrated tonight and I don't know what to do.

1c41c24;My mom is living in filth due to mental health and idk how to help her ;-strawberrylizard-;"I am no stranger to mental health struggles, I have PTSD, depression, and OCD myself and there's definitely been times when my mental health impeded my ability to do things like keep my home clean but this is next level.In 2022 my partner and I bought a double wide trailer and moved it onto my mom's property, we did this so I wouldn't be completely alone when my partner is at work because I have POTs and CFS and get pretty bad presyncope and fainting episodes. We thought it would be better to have family close by who could check on me and make sure I'm doing ok or come help me if something happens.Basically the whole reason we picked this location for our trailer was to help me with my worsening disability.We had not visited in my mom in person for 6 or 7 months prior to moving onto her property, although I did talk to her pretty much daily on the phone the state of her home was never mentioned. I was absolutely horrified to see when I walked in that the house didn't look like it had been cleaned in months, there was dirt, dog hair, old food, and grime accumulated on every surface.The drain pipes in the kitchen and bathroom had also completely broken off and she is catching the water in moldy disgusting buckets and emptying them outside or in the toilet. Everything under the sinks is completely saturated with mold. 2 of the windows in the house are also broken and covered with cardboard and plastic. This was especially confusing because my mom makes decent money, she could afford to fix the plumbing and windows and when I asked her why she hadn't she said it's because she doesn't want someone in her house to do it.I figured she was probably embarrassed by the state of the house but I've cleaned it up multiple times since then and she claims every time she'll call a plumber and a repair guy for the windows but never does it. She finally admitted it had nothing to do with the mess and she just doesn't want people in her house and never had any intention of calling anybody she just lied to make me ""shut up""  about it.Her 2 dogs are also filthy and disgusting.She loves her dogs, honestly to the point I think it's a bit obsessive and unhealthy how dependent on the dogs she seems to be, she doesn't want to go anywhere without them to the point she constantly misses important family events and holidays if she can't bring the dogs. But she is still neglecting them and it makes no sense.Their nails are horribly long to the point they're probably painful for the dogs, they hadn't been bathed in years, and their breath smells like something died in their mouths, they're also morbidly obese because my mom constantly feeds them things dogs shouldn't have like cake and ice cream. I have given them baths a couple of times but I can't do anything about their nails as the dogs are huge and horribly behaved and will bite if you touch their feet.I feel bad for them but don't know what else I can do as I don't have the money to hire a grommer or take them to the vet myself.As for the house itself, I'm the only one cleaning it with the help of my partner. The whole point of me moving here was supposed to be to take off some the load from me and now I'm maintaining two houses instead of one at determent to my own health.My mom doesn't lift a finger to help and usually actually complains about what we've done when we clean for her.She also denies having any mental health struggles and will not see a doctor despite that she's clearly struggling, and often talks about death and not wanting to be here anymore.I've cried everyday about this situation for over a year and I don't know how to help anymore.Any advice on what I should do or even can do would be greatly appreciated.";I am no stranger to mental health struggles, I have PTSD, depression, and OCD myself and there's def;Need Support;0;1;2024-04-14 19:07:02;2024-04-14;Sunday;19:07:02;3718;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:54.591215

1c405rc;"""just stop being depressed""";hkhowajaa;"Hello, I hope everyone's having a a good day so far. I'm dealing with something that I really could use some opinions on.  I've been severely depressed for 15 years. PTSD. Anxiety. Autism. 4 suicide attempts and 3 hospitalizations.  .I try and talk to my mom about it.  But everytime the conversation just devolves into her listing all the good things she's done, call me ungrateful, and that I need to ""choose happiness"". Citing like self help gurus and shit (which pisses me off in a a special kind of way). She can't get past it. I called her today because I woke from night terrors. I wasn't doing well.  Her first response was ""you had a nice bike ride yesterday why the fuck are you sad"". And I keep explaining that's not how it works but she just get angrier and angrier. What do I do? My mom and I have a great relationship aside from this but she just can't seem to understand what this is.  It really just feels like she's projecting her own expectations on the situation without actually wanting to deal with it.  It's just really defeating and I want to keep a relationship with her, but it's really a difficult when I have to pretend to be happy all the time, otherwise she throws a fit.

I just had to take the second pill that instant, I was shaking again, my nervous system was on high alert for no reason at all, I couldn't relax, I paced around in circles a few time debating if I should save it for later in the day, but I decided against it, and then went back to bed, actively feeling the calming effects once again.

1c3zcwz;Feel like I'm constantly drowning.;lettingitaaaaaallout;"This is probably just going to be a massive ramble, sorry.I can remember being a toddler, a child,, riddle with fear over everything whether it was men, school, talking to people, just leaving the house, food, just everything. With time I stopped being scared of some of those things, or maybe I just got better at dealing with it. I'd be scared of teachers, making a fool of myself in school, saying the wrong thing, doing the wrong things, my parents arguing downstairs, family getting sick.Then I got to secondary school and obviously I was a ""nerd"" and got picked on, thought I had some good friends but I didn't really (that'll come later).I didn't think about college, I didn't think I'd be alive that long. I was though, and picked whatever I was good at and dealt with it. I hated it, lost some friends, for average grade. I learnt how to drive and then never drove again out of fear.I didn't think about uni, I didn't think I'd be alive that long. I was though, and picked whatever I was good at and dealt with it. I hate it, lost more friends, didn't make new ones, didn't leave home, didn't have a career plan.I didn't think about work, I didn't think I'd be alive that long. You see a pattern? I got a shitty factory job, honestly looking back it wasn't shitty, I just felt wrongly ashamed of it. I left after a few years, after I lost my last friend in a really awful way, and got a simple part time job closer to home. I thought that was my chance, my chance to fix myself a little. Then a few months later the pandemic started. Then a few months later my dad died, it was horrible and sudden and I've not been right since. Now I deal with pretty severe health anxiety, which isn't helped by the multitude of physical health problems I've had since that that have had no real explanation.Around this same time my sister finished secondary school (there's a 10 year age gap between us) with below average grade (hello, pandemic) and tried going to college but couldn't handle it. She's not working, not in education, doesn't go out much. I worry about her constantly but don't know what to do or how to help. I'm not fit to help myself nevermind anyone else.I applied for a new job, which turned into a slightly different job that I don't want. The flexibility has gone and I literally handed in my notice just before Christmas because of the stress, but was convinced to stay. I love the people I work with, I hate the job. Try suffering from severe health anxiety while working in a hospital, it's not great.Recently my Mum has been incredibly stressed with her job, dealing with some health issues, and I don't know how to help her either. I still live at home (I mean, you've read this far, you can probably tell that), help with chores and bills, but I can't deal with other people's problems, not on top of mine.Now, last week, my Nanny (who we're very close to) ended up in the hospital. She's been very ill over many, many years, and this was a big hit. She's been living with my uncle for several years since her last major hospital admission, and we found out today she's scared of him. We had no idea. So, basically, she needs to live with us so we need to move. We need to sell her house and ours and move into another house quickly. She might be able to stay with a close cousin of ours if she comes out of hospital before we can sort that, but that's not really ideal. Thankfully my Mum knows someone who has a bungalow they want to sell, would be a good place but needs a lot of work, it has an annex my Nanny could use as she's very independent.Anyway, since finding out I've done nothing but cry and panic and sit paralyzed. I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what to do anymore, I can't live like this anymore, constantly scared and guilty. I keep thinking what if I'd got a better education, a better job, made more money, moved out. Maybe my Nanny would have moved in with my Mum instead all those years ago. What if I had a better go with relationships, met someone started a family, had more people to help and support us. Will I have to look after my Nanny now? Will I have to pick up driving again to take her places because no one else can? Will I need to move out if we can't find a big enough place to live? How will I afford that?I'm not a risk to myself or anyone else anymore, too scared of dying now for that, but I am worried one day I'm just going to snap, get on a train or walk into a forest and never come back, just a full mental break. I just realised today that I've honestly never really been happy. I've had moments while watching a good film or reading a good book where I've had fun, where I've enjoyed consuming that content, but I don't think I've ever been calm enough or felt safe enough to be happy. I've never gone to the doctor's about this, I've thought about it but always just felt like I'd ""get over it"" or that it was my fault or that I was making a big deal out of nothing. I don't really feel that way now, but I do feel too scared to go, like my GP will say all those things, or worse. I don't know what this is, no one will read it probably, and I know any advice would just be to reach out to someone (not that I have anyone to reach out to, I certainly can't go to my Mum or sister), or go to my GP or whatever. I know I should. I know I need to do something. But I'm just, I don't know how. Anyway, sorry, I just needed to put this somewhere. I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just exhausted.";This is probably just going to be a massive ramble, sorry.I can remember being a toddler, a child,, ;Venting;0;3;2024-04-14 17:46:00;2024-04-14;Sunday;17:46:00;5461;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:55.387046

1c3z37k;Am I negative or is it the truth?;jvnolyn;(Backstory)This past school year my attendance has been slim to none due to my depression getting more severe. I had gotten worried with myself because school has always been “my thing”. It’s to the point where I will more than likely have to do summer school. I told my friend about this and he told me I was thinking too negatively about the situation. (???) I’m not sure what led to me saying this but I had told him, “it doesn’t matter anyways, whether I fail or pass I’m gonna end up working a 12 hour shift for the rest of my life”. He then just kept on telling me I wasn’t understanding how there’s more to life and that I shouldn’t think so negatively.(Question)Is it bad I didn’t see anything wrong with thinking like that? It’s just the truth of life, it’s either graduation, college, and job or graduation then job or those steps leading to becoming a housewife.I simply don’t see the joy in any of these situations, even if there are those “little moments in life where everything seems right” is that all we have to live for? Those 15 minute moments every so often? That just doesn’t seem like a life worth living.

Trauma including: child of divorce, alcoholic mother (sober for 20+ years)Both parents financially unstableExposed to multiple deaths at young age,Victim of sexual assault, undiagnosed attention issues. probably otherThings i cant think of now.All of this has made relationships difficult. My whole life i have felt like i have had to pretend to be someone else to fit in. As a child i was very good at adapting to whatever the circumstance warranted. I had a close group of friends that were all very different and I was able to conform to their likes with ease. I was well liked by most kids. I always was a favorite with their parents as well. I have been told that i am very mature for my age. Yet, in my heart i knew this was masking. I also always knew how to manipulate situations to my benefit wether good or bad outcomes. I never saw this behavior as malicious. I remember the moment i realized what kind of person i was. As a teenager i came upon the movie, The Talented Mr. Ripley. It sickens me that i identify so well with this character. Like a chameleon he is able to change his personality to his benefit. I dont think i have any inate talents. Some people are natural athelites. Some are great technical minds. I am a professional copycat. I can sing very well. But i cant write lyrics. I can cover almost any song on guitar but do not have my own music. I am quite handy but i cant build anything from scratch. I am a jack of all trades master of none. I am also a very apathetic person. I am married going on 5 years now with 2 beautiful children. I like to think i am generally happy. We have a healthy relationship, are financially stable, and have a close friend group on both sides.  My wife always talks about things that happened to random people at her job and i could not care less. If they are not in my circle, they might as well not exist. Although i can act selflessly, it is not often this happens. I often think about what other people think of me. I imagine them being creeped out by my behavior when i dont see any problem. I have been told i can be intense and a hot head. I often get frustrated by people. I think everyone is an idiot. Ive taken to calling them NPCs (non playable characters.)I have even gone to lengths of telling my daughter when in our local grocery store, ""always assume that everyone in here is an idiot."" I dont want that mindset for her. I hate that i have told her that. I consider myself a realist, which people often equate to pessimism. I just see things how they are. The glass is not half full or half empty.

1c3xzvy;I'm so done with my life right now. I don't have any reasons to continue to live anymore.;Otherwise_Engine6171;MY PARENTS DON'T TAKE CARE OF ME. I have not yet reached adulthood. BUT I DO HAVE PARENTS. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY DON'T EXIST. THEY DO. My dad now has other 3 kids with his other wife. My mum also has one kid with her new husband. They left me to my grandma and she has to do everything to take care of me and we seriously could not afford everything. I want to fucking curse them to death because of how irresponsible they are to me. My mum always tries to compliment me and tells me shit bible quotes everyday and pretends it will help me survive this life. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO WORK. SHE HAS NO MONEY ATM BECAUSE SHE'S THE LAZIEST FUCKING ASSHOLE ON EARTH so only her husband takes care of my step-sister. Because of debts and expenses for the family my dad also isn't capable of taking care of me. He promised to buy me this and that all the stuff that I really NEED and not what I WANT. But then he's made no more contacts with me and I don't know what to do when I need something I can't afford myself. I'm so grateful yet feeling guilty because my nan deserves to enjoy her retirement yet she has to take care of me now because of the reckless shitty adults who gave birth to me. I'm in desperate need of permanent peace because I can't deal with this anymore. I have been very sad and disappointed because I don't deserve to go through this. I got distracted by someone at school who I have a crush on (I'm gay). Basically I am just so jealous of how he spends his time as a teenager. I wish I could be that happy and now I have to deal with constant stress + anxiety + overwhelm every second of my life and I am not exaggerating because NO ONE EVEN BELIEVES WHAT I SAY. I have no idea why posting on this subreddit would help anything. Because at the end of the day I'm just dealing with strangers who knows zero shits about my situation. It gets to the point where I have to FUCKING EXPLAIN EVERY FUCKING DETAIL and I just want everyone to know how complicated it is I can't put into words the shits I have to deal with. Luckily I do feel like I have a plan for my future that I don't really directionless. But the way my life gets held back because I have to literally walk on my own and I'm also worried about my grandma because i can only imagine how much pressure it puts on her just to take all of the responsibilities that my parents should have taken.All I want now is a warm hug or basically how can I die peacefully. My life has become hell for me and that makes me wanna seek comfort by having a crush on someone and hoping they will accept me. WHAT'S WORSE is my crush is moving abroad in a few weeks. I've had come to a conclusion that I was born to be a victim because no matter how much hard work I put into achieving something I just never make it there because of lack of help and support from friends and family. I wanted to cry so hard but the stress makes me unable to even drop a tear on my face. I have ADHD and dyslexia but never got diagnosed with them because how the fuck can I in this economy. Being unable to stop excessive obsession and struggling with things related to language like spellings, reading and explaining things to people or simply putting thoughts into words no i am simply incapable of doing that. I JUST WANNA DIE because earth before and after I existed doesn't change. My existence only causes more problems for everyone or even myself and now I can't find anyone who can understand.

Half of these jokes don’t even make sense, but everyone still laughs at it . They make fun of my parents for no reason , they tell  some really bad and dark jokes ,one about an accident where I nearly got killed, (yes , u read it right) . I am actually introverted so I used to tolerate everything, but I know feel something’s no wrong . The thing is that my friends get good marks , so taking to a teacher won’t help .Now many would say that I should break off connections with them , but I can’t we go the same tuition and everything . So, I can’t really avoid them as well. Ofc I can tell my parents, who actually love me very much, but something inside me tells my friends can change . However , I am losing that belief .So pls tell me what should I do , cause I am now even scared to go to school because of them , and I can’t even study properly cause that’s what I think all the time .

1c3xmw8;Mentally Drained;United_Sandwich7059;I moved my mom into our household to help with childcare and help give her a healthy environment where she can be near people for her mental health and general well being. My mom has a poor grasp on mental health and has always struggled with anxiety and depression, accepting that it’s just part of normal life.Not without difficulty along the way she’s made huge bounds in managing her anxiety, but still has days where she struggles with particularly anxiety which also feeds into another layer of depression. The past couple weeks she’s been having a hard time, typical cycles of not wanting to do anything and socialize. Been trying to help her manage it, somewhat unsuccessfully this week, which is fine. Some days are better than others.Today I’ve been trying to help her work through the idea of staying inside and sleeping and inviting her to do errands outside of the house and I’d either get no response or just be told not to talk. I’ve heard it all before and can handle it. But it tears me to shreds. I’m conscious of how I’m affected and am very resilient, though I’ve struggled on the past as well.I just feel like every time I soldier through negative interactions that I’m just losing a bit of myself.

1c3xkjl;I feel like I'm waiting my bf to cheat on me;fizikmizik;This sounds so stupid but I can't trust my bf fully because he cheated on his two exes emotionally (probably physically too idk). I didn't know these before the relationship started and when I found out I broke down and had a panic attack because I already had trust issues. As I know him more and more, I realized that he seeks validation from strangers. I talked to him about his insecurities and made it clear that I'm not okay with him flirting with strangers even if nothing happens eventually. He denied having insecurities and him seeking validation from other people. But recently he admitted to me that he seeks it. I just tried to comfort him, told him he doesn't need to do this. I am giving and I will give all my love and affection to him as much as possible. He thinks that since I love him, I'm not being objective about him. And when a stranger compliments him, it's more real. I told him I am always completely honest with him and that I think strangers can't truly know who you are so it's not valuable. But if someone who knows you well still stays with you and even love your flaws, it's more special. I don't know why but I think this didn't make him change his mind. I can't trust him, I want to talk to him about this once our schoolwork gets easier because I don't want to make him overwhelmed about something didn't happen (i hope). I'm just curious about your opinions about seeking validation from strangers and what I can do to comfort him and change his mind. Should I even talk to him about this issue? I'm slowly losing my mind over this. I can't cope.

They backtalked in my family's face as soon as I got out of home to college. I tried to simply ignore them and now I just feel resentful for people who do things like this. I had strong feelings against back talkers in the first place. My mom has PSP, so basically Parkinsons+emotional Alzheimers. (Link to explain if the comparison isn't good enough: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6096-progressive-supranuclear-palsy) The wailing at nights didn't stop for about 2 years. I was a primary caretaker for her during parts of day because I was dual enrolled and my dad was at work. (he later transitioned primarily to home). I also had a counselor who sucked at their job in HS so I ended up doing the jobs of like at least one other grown man during my last year. It was so bad that he wasn't getting legally required paperwork processed.I got to college and I love what I'm doing, but school is challenging (which is fine). But I had a random roommate who just is baseline frustrating. He's loud, has friends over all the time, watches Tiktok or streams music for HOURS at a time without headphones and barely ever leaves the room.

1c3x7o6;Family Concerns + Future Divorce = Anxiety;Throwaway_first12;"A little backstory. My parents are both seniors, with my dad filing for retirement later this year. His income is going to drop heavily since his contract for this current job ends in June. Unfortunately, he never really planned or saved up anything for retirement and it's already starting to bite him in the ass. My mom is currently looking for work but she does not have enough credits currently to file for retirement. It's a long story but their CPA fucked them over by convincing my dad to not file for my mom separately and just to combine the money she made into his tax filings. My dad is a South Asian immigrant who held onto the social cultures for too long to realize it screwed him over (the whole men should work, women shouldn't need to). I am doing my best to help them look for financial assistance and jobs, built a resume for my mom and gave my dad a template to fill out with his work experience (he still hasn't filled it out due to work due dates). Luckily enough, the city we live in announced they're going to open up Section 8 Voucher applications this year so I'm trying to stay on top of that for whenever they announce the official date.My brother married his current wife and they've been together for about a decade. (I""m bad with dates). However, after her father died, she changed into someone completely different. She started becoming more numb but also recently, started flirting with people online. She was caught and when confronted, just froze up. Even her mom called her out on it. My brother wants to do couples therapy but she has not shown any motivation to do so, to the point where she's not even sure if she wants to stay in a single relationship.Here's the part where I feel like I'm being completely selfish. My brother plans to move back in with my parents after I move out (lightly apartment hunting now due to a possible lawsuit with my coding camp ISA company, hopefully leads to nullifying the ISA). My fiance and I are looking at some places. However, my brother doesn't have a stable job currently but has experience as a part time art teacher (not state licensed so brought in under a contract) and he has almost 2 decades of experience as an artist and has done commissions for large companies. My worry is that he wouldn't be able to financially help my parents if he moves back in. I live in a pretty expensive state and my parents already don't make much. I always give them what I can to help but after I move out and everything, I won't be able to as much since I'll essentially be having a family to take care of. I gave my brother my resume to use as a template that helped me get my current job and I'm just waiting for him to fill it out so I can edit it after.This whole combination has been spiking my anxiety and depression for a month non-stop since all this happened last month. I currently take Buproprion and Buspirone for anxiety and used to take Venlafaxine but my cholesterol spiked hard when I was on it. I feel absolutely stuck cause on one hand, I should be supporting his choice leading towards a divorce if things continue. On the other I'm worried about my parents cost of living and my brother not having a stable enough job to help them. And on the third hand, I don't want to stretch myself so thin that I have to financially support myself, fiance, my brother, and my parents at the same time.";A little backstory.

I genuinely feel like I remember so little compared to other people and struggle to tell stories because I can’t remember small details and sometimes can’t think of the correct words. This happens to me frequently where I struggle to find the correct word. The rest of my family is very smart, can recall minute details, so it is just me. I feel a lot of anxiety telling stories, worrying I won’t be able to get to the end.It is extremely frustrating - I’m always trying to better myself and work through it. I tried working out more, eating healthier, reading, but it almost feels pointless because I often can’t recall the details of what I read, whereas for someone else they could spit facts no problem. I am very anxious and struggle with mild depression, I take Lexapro, but I feel like a lot of this stems from my memory issues urgh!!! I do frequently have days where I feel unable to communicate properly but forcing myself to try and do so because I feel like a depressive cloud over my head. This happened Christmas Eve Eve, and it was an incredible struggle and I slurred my words a bit at one point. In those moments, I start to think about every word coming out of my mouth, making it more difficult to speak. But I try my best to hide it and most people think I am radiating with positivity. I just want to remember the things I experience in detail and be able to communicate as easily as everyone else. I feel so much stupider than my friends and want to have a normal life and tell my posterity the things I did the places I went. I don’t know what to do, my memory issues are affecting every facet of my life.;Hi, I’m not sure what’s wrong with me.

1c3w1i5;I feel like a puzzle piece that came in the wrong box.;EnthusiasmConfident9;"Some background, I have BPD so my view of the status of my relationships is skewed naturally. sometime people with BPD have a hard time experiencing fulfilling relationships or confidently trusting in your identity as a person, but I truly feel like I’m not good, nor bad, just….meh.Like I’m not bad enough to be treated as an outcast; I’m not flipping people off and complaining about everyone/everything, I’m kind to everyone I meet and I usually love making people laugh. But also, I’m not good enough to be surrounded by a bunch of friends. I feel like I have NOTHING amazing to say since I live a pretty stable, non-chaotic lifestyle. Photography as a hobby, work 9-5, go to the gym, make content and help my wife with her hobbies/career, take care of the dog. I don’t work in an incredible career making huge money, I have a good amount of muscle but not cut like a Hollywood star. It just feels like I’m stuck in this nice middle mark where I’m so boring and uninteresting that no one wants to take time to get to know me. Which; thank god for my wife, she’s my best friend and she’s been that way for so long. But none of our friends ever want to hangout with JUST me, my family never visits, and I struggle making friends where I live. I feel stuck.

1c3vu9r;Memory loss due to bad mental health ;ragwon;I've started realising that after going through a long phase of bad mental health, you start having these memory losses. If someone asks me or tells me something from my childhood, I am unable to recall most of it. I can only recall instances which I have repeated many times in my mind by recalling them. Today I read a question on Reddit to recall an instance where you came out of your cowardice and handled the situation but I was unable to recall any such instance. Although, I rarely confront people cause I'm a people pleaser and kind of a coward but still there have been instances where I have shown courage and confronted the people. Just that I was unable to recall them.So my question is after working on your mental health, healing yourself... Do people start recalling things again easily which they are unable to do so in the bad mental health phase?;I've started realising that after going through a long phase of bad mental health, you start having ;Question;2;2;2024-04-14 15:13:09;2024-04-14;Sunday;15:13:09;865;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 15:18:34.941964
1c3vu0p;Why can't I be free from the pills and function healthy? I keep relapsing... I am so tired.;anonpingu;I (26F) have been on so many pills and therapy the last 8 years of my life. And I am still so so so unstable. I am feeling so sorry for myself, using all these pills for so many years like a testing animal. And still, I can't cope with anything. I had depression, anxiety, ocd. I had long lasting therapies, so many months with pills (antidepressants, sedatives, stimulants)... (Mirtazapine, Alprazolam/Xanax, Fluvoxamine, Ritalin, Concerta, Paroxetine, Vortioxetine, Mexazolam/Sedoxil, Sertraline/Zoloft, etc.etc....)Some periods, I get better due to some pills or something exciting happening in my life. But then I'm down again. The last a few years, I started to feel less intelligent, with worse memory. I feel like I'm losing myself.A few months ago, with my doctor, we thought I beat my 3rd depression. We quit antidepressants because I have been feeling amazing for so many months. I have been using those pills for more than a year so that I don't relapse. But I'm very unstable again due to some problems happening in my life which left me with anxiety induced nausea, cryings, muscle tension, body trembling, bad dreams every nigth etc. He gave me some new pills for generalized anxiety (Pregabaline and Mexazolam as S.O.S.) but they don't work. And I am so sick and tired of pills. I feel like I will never get rid of this mental illness that I'll always be like this. But I can't function and get my life together like this. I don't want to be a pill addict. I just don't know what to do and living alone in a foreign country doesn't help me. I'm feeling so lonely. I have a long distance boyfriend (in another continent ). I call him, I call my family (in another country), but I think they are also tired of me being sad or anxious all the time.  I still see my therapist for 2 times a month (which is already very expensive for me) but I really think that it's not working anymore.I really lost myself. I don't know how to find and bring her back. I used to be a very active, intelligent, creative, funny person. But now it's just constant problems...How will I heal myself, without pills?

1c3v45f;I can’t keep friends and offended my new friend and I don’t understand why (not the first time);Thy_Water_BottIe;So my whole like I haven’t really been able to keep friends. Now I’m a 21FI have a habit of being very emotional but masking everything so most of the time I’m like a robot saying learned responses. When I be myself or let people into my true emotions it starts going downhill like I’m too clingy or sensitive. Outside of a professional environment I don’t seem to function I’ve always felt like I’m an alien and different but not in a quirky way.  Other “weird” things I do when I’m not masking (which is rare I’m always making and exhausted by this) are making weird noises or rubbing my hands, skin picking, I can’t handle change well at all, bad sensory issues (light,texture,noise). I have short lived hyper fixations. So here is an example of a situation two days ago i was with my 19M friend that I am letting live in a duplex on my property. Anyways so we were in the car and as a joke I said “if I was super rich I sue people for fun especially corrupt doctors or drs that rip people off, like this one dr I had who gaslighted me about my condition, even if I didn’t win it would still be satisfying to put her through 3 weeks of hell in court.” Now I just said this without thinking this through I wasn’t being serious and I’m nowhere near rich. My brain kinda wasn’t functioning and I wasn’t thinking of literal suing. More like in TV shows where they yell I’ll sue u. I was a little serious about the gaslighting dr one.  Anyways he gets mad and says thats horrible and I’m just like (Bob fake name). The medical situation with the dr included a month of excruciating pain and bleeding that she didn’t take seriously. Now it might be blood cancer.  Now my boundary is we don’t talk about (bob). A little context (Bob ) is a man who not related to me but basically destroyed my family and hurt my grandmother who has dementia. He tried to steal her stuff isolated her basically abused her. So I had to go through court with him to get my grandma to safety. And not to mention the literal physical destruction he brought to our house that we can’t even sue him for since he has no money. He broke my family apart. I have a small family. He also most likely gave my grandpa Covid and grandpa died. (Bob) person also was disruptive ans disrespectful at my grandpas service. So I avoid this topic bc I have a PTSD meltdown and panic attacks. Roommate knows this. Still said it. I melted down. He eventually said we should stop being friends and I’m too sensitive. Now he might be friends but wants space from me and I’m confused why. I apologized I did everything i could think of and I am giving him space. I still don’t see the issue with my joke. I usually mimic people’s joking style but this time I didn’t. And he does say out of pocket things. Emotions confuse me heavily. Like if someone’s mad I’ll think they are gonna be mad at me forever.  I genuinely do not want to hurt people. Sometimes I need to verbal vomit stuff like that idk. I’m just sad and it’s only reinforcing the belief that I can never make friends.;So my whole like I haven’t really been able to keep friends.

1c3ui33;Am I in danger?;Mobile-Scar7448;Hello everyone, posting about my neighbour.My wife and I live in a shared house, with each of our neighbours living in separate rooms with the kitchen and living area being shared.We have a neighbour which is acting very strange, and I wanted your guys opinion on if my wife and I should move out.Details of what is concerning is written below:Probably the main concern is that we feel like whenever we go to the kitchen to prepare our food or eat is a signal for the neighbour to come as well. At first we thought it was just coincidence, but we've been living in the house with him 6 months now and the feeling hasn't changed.When he does come to the kitchen he usually walks around without a purpose, as though he is trying to get his steps in or something. He doesn't directly interact with us or anything.We have noted from the corners of our eye that he stares at us when we are not looking. We also saw him staring at the other neighbour when  that guy came in to the kitchen to grab some food from the fridge and didn't say a word.We noticed that he often smiles so that we could see his teeth, but he isn't listening to anything and isn't looking at his phone. While we are in the kitchen having our meal, he could come in several times and going back to his room numerous times (I know it doesn't sound bad but more details written below). He comes into the kitchen, takes out a cup and leaves to his room immediately, only to return back in 10 seconds to take something else out and to leave once again. He could do that non stop for 30 minutes while we are eating.Another point is him needing something when we start using it. He could be standing next to the sink just browsing his phone for 20 minutes, and as soon as we come over to wash our dishes he will remember that he needs it too and put his phone away. This happens so many times.In general i think the guys has issues with memory and is clumsy. For example we have a roster for taking out the trash, but each time it's his turn he asks us to remind him. Once I left the room just to pick something up from the fridge and he followed me as well(not surprised) and I went back to my room as soon as I grabbed what I needed. I looked back curious what will he do in the kitchen only to see him stop as soon as he entered it, switch on the lights, switch them back off, and started going back into his room.We noted that he stops following us when he thinks we are not friendly to him, but that lasts only for a few days.On his first night he locked himself out of his own room at 5 am and my wife and I woke up to the sound of him trying to brake the door down to not skip his work. We were terrified and were afraid to leave the room.Whenever he enters the kitchen, he cover the windows with blinds no matter what time of day it is, so the kitchen is always dark.He leaves his stuff in the washing machine, without actually starting to wash them. We often ask him to take his stuff out, only to discover that he just started the machine.Sometimes when I was my dishes he just stands behind me for a long time, which creeps me tfo.Does anyone know what is wrong with the guy and if my wife and I should move out or not?We tried looking him up but could find anything.He told us that he has a daughter in another country, but we never heard him talking with any of his friends or relatives.The reason why we are staying is because of the contract and the low rent ( living in Perth, Australia which is experiencing an increase in rent prices now).;Hello everyone, posting about my neighbour.My wife and I live in a shared house, with each of our ne;Opinion / Thoughts;5;1;2024-04-14 14:12:31;2024-04-14;Sunday;14:12:31;3517;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 15:18:34.951817

1c3ud76;I have a problem with my life;AleXSySt3m;Hi everyone, my name is Alexander, I am 20 years old. This is the first time I ask a question on reddit, but I think there are people here who can help me.I live a comfortable stable life. I have an apartment from my parents, a girlfriend with whom I live in this apartment. Everything is calm and fine with us. I study at university, and I do not need to work, because my parents have money to provide for me. There are friends with whom I periodically chill, I have TV, good PC and all things that only I need. It's like I have everything. But I'm not happy.Almost all the time I play games, watch youtube or series, anime, movies (alone or with a girl). This makes me calm and joyful for some time, but not for long enough. Accordingly, in my studies I have low attendance and bad grades, I am on the verge of dropping out. Actually the study itself I am also uninterested, I would like to do in a completely different sphere. But for this I need to make efforts, which I can't make myself, and I don't want to, because it seems to me that there is another way to start doing something. However, whenever I plan to start doing something, I fail to follow my own plan, because I am busy with something else and I don't have motivation to start doing something. Often after that I start crying and my girlfriend calms me down, but of course it doesn't lead to anything. And everything repeats the same scenario: I again do not study, read or do other things that I would like to do and I again after a while suffer because of this and again promise myself to start. I can't get out of this cycle. I went to a psychiatrist, he only said that my condition is very similar to ASD, but still there is not enough data for such a diagnosis. I wish that someone will give me clear instructions to solve my problem, but I don't know what to do to find it by myself. That's why I decided to describe my problem here. I hope that there are people who can help me. Thank you in advance.P.s.

1c3u1ik;Need To Get My Wife Back;SlackerSlinky;"I never thought I would be the guy typing the “wall of text” on an anonymous account.  My wife and I have been together for more than 30 years. Her family has always been a challenge, lots of dysfunction. Not in the physical abuse sense but very much an “everyone ignoring the elephant in the room”, primarily the whole family worked around this dysfunction, regardless of the impact to everyone.  This has caused lots of stress and strain over the years, but our marriage has been great, I don't think we have ever argued, we are totally in sync with each other 99.9% of the time. I gave her latitude with her family and tried to just go with the flow, because it was difficult, I could compartmentalize.   She has always been very anxious and worries a lot, but that would go up and down. Then came a bike accident where she ended up in surgery for a new collarbone. After that, COVID hit and she was disproportionately worried about that (she eventually got it, but not bad). Then a heart surgery for a valve issue. Tack on a long battle with hot flashes, for years, that has not helped her, and trying to get off of the anti-depressants (for hot flashes, not depression), has been rough. Basically a series of things in her life that I had to spend a disproportionate amount of time talking her through, but that is a spouse’s job.   We decided to move out of state next year and she will be leaving her late 80’s parents here in town. They swear they will be fine. But neither really is. This caused a lot of strain and things came to a head. They said we are free to go and the family dynamics changed. We’ve been VERY happy about this fresh start.   Her extended family was all in town and that visit (10-15 days) created a HUGE amount of stress for her. It got to the point that she was turning off all text notifications and not answering her phone. In the midst of all of this, she suddenly ""saw the light', she recognized the dysfunction in her family and realized all that I had done in putting up with it for three decades. She said I was too good to her that I should not have had to go through all of this and could not thank me enough. I thought great, she finally had a breakthrough. But then it turned.I think she had a breakdown. Then she started spiraling downward. She sleeps a lot. She is speaking in gibberish like she is trying to string together a stream of consciousness. Normally a commercial skipper/muter, I just watched her watch an Arby’s commercial at high volume. She got up from the couch and without saying a word to me, went for a walk around the block at 6AM. Then stare up at the street light.  She says things like “I’m fine”, “I just need to trust the process,” and “If you know you know.” I ask her “what is the process”? She can’t articulate, just “I know what I see.” I ask her what does she mean by these other things. She can’t say.  For a few days she would admit that things were going on but she could not articulate what is happening. Now she will not even say anything is wrong.   I highly doubt it is drugs, she does not have that history and does not really go out anywhere. She hasn’t even done her normal gym or yoga that were a huge part of her life. It is not some kind of cult or Qanon or anything like that.   It is a wholesale personality change. She did begin to engage with her doctor (PCP) and seek a therapist last week, but when I ask about it she’s gone from being over open to “how many times do I have to tell you” without actually ever telling me anything.  Can a massive stress event like having this family reunion and the whole shitshow that comes with it actually cause such a dramatic night and day personality change and cognitive dysfunction?  Her family is panicked, I am panicked, I do not know how to get through to her. She keeps saying she is fine, but her personality is so dramatically different that I just don’t know what to do.";I never thought I would be the guy typing the “wall of text” on an anonymous account.

1c3tzf2;THINGS THAT MADE MY ANXIETY GONE, WHAT HAVE I CHANGED AND I FEEL HAPPIER THAN THE PERIOD BEFORE I HAD ANXIETY;SeaCaterpillar1603;"Hello friends, as you can see from the title, I will explain how I got better during this whole process and how I realized and understood what I did wrong and WHY it was wrong, in a way that will explain it well and not be too boring.DISCLAIMER: I can't tell you what to do, maybe you are already doing these things, or maybe there is another problem, I don't know, but maybe you can try these things, they worked for me;1. Giving up sexual immorality and fixing the issues of relationship and love in my mind: I commited myself to the woman that I was in a situationship with,because I’ve realized situationships and also things such as open relationship and playing hide and seek,hot-cold relationship are harmful and should be avoided. Any non-serious situationship and sexual immorality other than a named,commited,serious relationship is harmful. I learned the sexual function of the Oxytocin and Vasopressin hormones, so whether it is pornography, sexual fantasies that are over the top kinky and humiliating,probably even performed  to somehow ""mark"" the partner, whether it is cuckolding or trying to distant yourself with force because of fear of abandonment, whether it is talking to others while seeing someone,in short anything that can signal polygamy, cheating and cuckoldry into our subconscious,are pretty harmful.Unless there is a committed relationship, there should be no half-assed person at all, and we should have as little history as possible sexually, stay away from himuliating and bad memory marking sexual fantasies, and have open communication about more innocence and love, and not create unnecessary pain and longing, I realized that such things are not jealousy or insecurity as todays post modern liberal media and feminism says,but a healthy relationship outlook.2. Quit all kinds of drugs (yes,including weed), sugar, caffeine,nicotine and alcohol and stop seeing them as cool: Drinking these may not have caused any problems in the past, but after Covid and its vaccine, our body may have started to react more sharply to them due to some inflammation.Just because those things didn’t affect me before,doesn’t mean they can’t be the cause,who knows maybe I got more conscious due to covid.Or like I said in the first place,they are just feeding the inflammation caused by the covid. I would say don't keep doing the bad things you used to do, who knows, maybe Covid or its vaccine didn't cause any problems, the thing that caused problems is that you gained awareness during the lockdown.In any given scenario,these things aren’t good.All these things are also constantly making you release dopamine which can inevitably end up in dopamine wornout.But don’t worry,neuroplasticity will replace those neurotransmitters with new ones.PS: Cocoa has four times more caffeine then coffee beans,keep that in mind ;)3. Socializing and having a job: I realized that socializing is not an addiction or needyness, on the contrary, it is something that should be in human nature. Likewise, having a job and earning money is not a bad thing,humanity always worked throughout his evolution,so helping with a load in a community sure helps.Just make sure the job youre doing is ethically sound and really needed for society,but even if you can’t find such job open,if you don’t need to work because you’re economically stable,then I say try to come up with something that can benefit humanity in most ethical and moral way.But if you’re someone who needs to work or financially supported by a parent even though you’re finished college,go get a job and earn some money.Even if you reject the whole idea of work,there’ll still be microphones and cameras needed to explain your propaganda,so not all works are bad,even if you’re an anarchist.4. Stopping watching music and movies: Both in terms of the effects of these things on brain chemistry and the messages they signal to our subconscious and the mood swings they cause which is pretty unnatural to our evolution due to the fact that they’re pretty new,I was indulging in those things too much, like a drug in a way, and every drug creates anxiety.I felt like if I didn't make music, I didn't deserve the woman I was in situationship at that time and it would be my fault if she left me; both because I was abandoned in the past and I myself did abandon someone,and unfortunately,when I connect the dots (which you should do top,just make sure you’re connecting the right dots) these events were seeded because of the simplification of relationships brought by this whole post-modern society.But then I realized that if someone does not love me for what I am not by what I can offer,doesn’t matter whether it’s money or music,cars,houses or albums or movies, it is unnecessary to play stupid games and purposefully torture myself to starve myself of clarity in our relationship and communicate more daily instead of the once in a month we were doing because of I wasn’t a rockstar yet.(I know it sounds too cringe,but I’ve gotta tell the truth) I realized these were childish things when compared to the possibility of real,unconditioned love.6. I started to dream things that would actually help others: Rather than dreaming about personal pleasures,which I often did by playing an album and dreaming about how I,myself and I would be the niche-cult favorite-lore king cool.It was all rooted down to my past abondance,then-current situationship where I was afraid to make a commitment and ask for commitment,my long before girlfriend and how we handled things in our intimateness and how degrading it was;and my way of coping with all of this big mesh by forcing myself to believe that open relationships,being careless,seeing love as neediness and lame,being alone as a virtue and anything else as compulsiveness was pretty against our human nature.We shouldn’t hate human nature,everything is there because of a cause,we should understand it and execute properly.Even anger has a place,if it wasn’t so then the evulition would diminish it.We just have to handle them properly (Not in the sense of diminishing them or manipulating them,just be more conscious of them and use them to our fullest potential and avoid the harms that might occur if executed wrongly)7. I have given up superstitions: And the belief that the universe's purpose is to teach me a bad lesson by beating me up with weird laws of attraction and the like.But I’ve gotta say,I understand that traditional wisdom was also real and they weren’t jusf pre science era dummies who just supposed things,they were the one’s who did their science by trial and error,and transferring their scientific results by telling tales and writing religious books.So the thing that they refer to as spirit,might just be psychology.Different names,same thing.8. I stopped keeping silent and not making criticism : I realized that we can be good by speaking out and discussing together, instead of keeping silent about people's situations and abandoning them,I realized arguing is not a bad thing, on the contrary, it is better not to remain silent to preserve momentary peace over the real peace which is forever.9. I understood the importance of sexual morality: And how men and women should behave and take responsibility regards to their chastity, And starting to act like a father/mother even if they were not going to have children. The reason for this is that it is in our nature to have children,and this might be the basis of what is called love and peace,this might be the reason of humanity’s longing for peaceful and organized environment,because of the well being of their offsprings.The whole notion of empathy might be flowering from there.So a life that proposes a proper family structure might help,it did help in my situation.And even if one hasn’t found the one,thinking about their partner in future and acting accordingly,which means not indulging in any sexual activity before settling down with someone,not being flirty with people all the time all around,and acting as if everyone will find his/her spouse one day so not making loose interactions with people around him/her.Even if one wants to remain a celibate,not messing around and taking responsibility of sexual interactions by avoiding them.10. I became vegan, I try to be compassionate against everything: I know this one might be impossible for you if you have serious health conditions,but all I can say is please try to minimize as much as you can in terms of your needs and wants.And even if you must eat meat,please obtain it from a grass-fed grass-finished sources.I'm careful not to crush ants even while walking.Compassion for others might give you the love you wanted,or even you can give that love to yourself.I know the phrase “To love others you must love yourself first” which is true,if you’re an humanity hating person it would be pretty hard to love anyone or anything,let alone yourself.But sometimes,in order to love ourselves,we must love others first.Sometimes it’s the other way around.11.Whenever something,some word,some thought triggered me,I asked myself these questions: What did I see when I had an attack as a result of a trigger? What could my subconscious be trying to tell me? What is it signaling? What kind of a moral rule might this represent,did I have violated that rule myself,now or in the past ? What is it that I see and why is it disturbing? And how can I make that thing disturbing? I realized that I needed to take a closer look and see what my subconscious was actually trying to tell me.12. I did intermittent fasting : Still doing it pretty often,both to prevent overeating and causing a constant dopamine hit in my brain chemistry and to consume less juice in general.13. I fasted and did one meal a day: So that if there was any anxiety-producing or anxiety-promoting bacteria in my body, it would go away.14. I made my sleep regular, and I didn’t only in terms of getting enough sleep, but in natural hours,the natural cycle, that is, I prioritized sleeping 8 hours at the right interval rather than just sleeping 8 hours from 6 a.m to 2 p.m15. I did dopamine detox: You can see what is explained in more detail on the internet. I did this to accelerate Neuroplasticity.";Hello friends, as you can see from the title, I will explain how I got better during this whole proc;Research Study - Mod Approved;0;2;2024-04-14 13:48:01;2024-04-14;Sunday;13:48:01;10226;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 15:18:34.954855

I had close friends whom I enjoyed spending time with and loved, or at least I knew how to love and accept others. My sisters were always by my side, and my family was very happy; they were all around me. Then my older sisters traveled, and I felt extremely lonely. I met a guy online and started a relationship with him for 4 months. Because I was 16 years old, my parents were not pleased with it, and their treatment towards me changed. I ended the relationship, and my brother still doesn't talk to me even though it's been 4 months since the incident. My parents' trust in me vanished. Due to my bad mental state, I lost my close friend, and my relationship with everyone became cold and superficial. Now my mental state is not improving. I always feel rejected by people.

1c3tj2t;I dont know what I can/need to do anymore.;Ornate_Kobold;Hello, I saw this and thought I'd give a post here a try.Some background. Im 21, I've struggled with issues at home and mental health since I was a little over 8. Both my parents are separated and out of my life. I grew up being abused in various ways. Ive been in and out of therapy since I was 14, and saw a nurse practitioner, PsyD regularly from 15 to 20.I had issues with my self image,  anxiety, and depression since I was 8. And after around 12 or 13 I started to see things and hear things other people didn't notice or seem to care at all. I had a lot of issues as well as the older I've gotten the more I began to hallucinate. It all started leading to high paranoia especially as some of the people in my life were also gaslighting me based on my hallucinating. My diagnosis always changed and it felt like every visit to the PsyD it was changed or worsening. It went from severe anxiety and major depression to majpr depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms. It eventually went between schizo affective disorder, schizophrenia, and psychosis.I used to be on government aid and mecical insurance through my old state. I have always been moving in life since we first moved out of my house at 6 I never lived in one house for more than 1.5 years. It was to the extent of moving to a new place every month at one point in life.I unfortunately came across more housing issues when i turned 18 and during the pandemic I was considered homeless by the state and then on. At 20 my medical insurance stopped and i was never able to get a stable diagnosis for my mental illness.I did eventually find my current partner online and we started a relationship online. But later on my insurance stopped and any renewal form would not go through as I was disqualified for medical insurance and support woth food. Then I kept going through issue after issue with things untill I was able to move to Virginia to live with my partner. Weve been living together with a roomate for the past 8 months and they have been very supportive and helpful with things. I love my partner. They have financially, and mentally supported me through everything so far.My issue stands now that I do not have any medical insurance, my old ID expired after i turned 21 mid December, and I have been having issues taking care of things on my end.It has become increasingly obvious to my partner and roomate that I've mentally declined since around late January early February, and I have been noticing it too. My partner actively serves in the navy but planning to not stay after their time is up. My partner and I all feel I need to seek therapy and psychiatry. However our finances can not support the bills from that. We are not married so their work will not provide assistance. I feel lost and cant keep track of reality sometimes. I can barely stand going out in public due to feelings of people watching me. Reading my thoughts, conspiring at my well-being. I keep hearing and seeing things that nobody else can and my usual methods of coping will not work at all.I dont know what  need to do to seek help. Is there free or cheap psychiatric support out there? I've heard about people with schizophrenia being able to recive some form of government support similar to disability. How would I get any diagnosis in my state?If there is financial support for my condition in my state how would I go about getting it?Theres so many questions and looking up things on Google has been a drag as well as relatively unhelpful.

I’m looking forward to it because recently I’ve had periods of what feels like depression (intense guilt, sadness, hopelessness etc) followed by periods of happiness, mental stability, and extreme hope (like feeling I’m on top of the world). This has been messing with my head.However every time I’ve thought of therapy I’ve been hesitant to go for it because I think it would be selfish in my case. A big reason why I feel this way now is because I regret some things I did intensely. There are people who do nothing wrong and still have mental health issues, and I feel like I’m taking resources away from them because I want to feel better.I would like to know which are some good reasons that are not related to me feeling better that would make it a good idea for me to go to therapy, so I can stop being so hesitant.

But ever since I beat depression I hadn’t had a moment like this. I no longer feel confident and have excitement for the days to come. I want to go back to the person I was a couple of months ago. He was confident outgoing loveable. The other thing is that I feel so alone. I’ve come to realise that even though I have quite a few friends no one is there for me. I don’t have anyone that I can see everyday and hangout. I forgot how to talk to other people and meet new ones since the only thing I’ve talked about the past 2 months is my ex. I miss my energetic fun happy self. I don’t want to be depressed once again. All I do everyday is sit in my room and scroll through YouTube.

1c3s7rq;Im failing a year at college, how to cope?;KaluSmiga;Im 100% failing my second year. It all happend due to depression that started around october..Some serious self doubt and not feeling enough for anyone. Girlfriend left me, parents dont ever seem proud of me and everyone is still putting expectations on me. Depression hit the hardest because of the breakup. Now its been around 5 months and im healed up from it. But due to my weard collage schedules I'm already failing 70% of classes. I couldn't bring myself to study as i would just wander into depression again and honestly i couldn't even hear or read whatever i was supposed to study. I realized that if i cant focus on studying i should focus on myself. I started focusing on my own happines and started going out more, even alone at times, took a trip with friends, and found hobbies. I have no job but I've had paid scholarship for both years I've been at school. Recently I've had THE talk with my mother where she was furious called me all kinds of names and just made it clear how much of disappoinment I am to her. She knows that I've had mental problems but she thinks that i should show people how much brighter i can shine without them instead of falling apart (indicating the thing about my ex). Which is true but this was my first ever breakup with someone who meant everything to me, so u just couldn't switch 180° and be like okay time to study. I dont think the world has ended because im gonna repeat a year, I'm gonna find a job now so by the time next year starts I can pay it all by myself. She says how the money isnt the issue how me being lazy/not interested in life is. Im gonna be honest im fine with failing a year, depression is no longer there from the past 5 months. Its just that i dont know how much I'll endure hearing from them about it all. My parents and my siblings. My sister and her husband both finished the same school and course and are working in the industry for quite some time. And its all going to that how my sister finished everything is living the life while look at me i cant do that. I think that if i countinued to study while all that depression was on me i would still not pass the year and i would be in a bigger hole then i ever was.

1c3retx;How to get rid of contamination ocd;podzimni_anicka;It’s ruining my social life and making my anxiety worse, I think that it all started after I got attacked (I was 14, it was a year ago), a grown woman slapped me, there was also a man verbally threatening me and all that, I don’t want to go into the details cause i don’t want to remember this, but I’ll just say that I developed ptsd, severe anxiety and a panic disorder, ik that it may sound stupid, I only got attacked so why did it break me so much, but it was more than a small physical and verbal assault. So please don’t ask me how only this could make me feel this way. Anyways, a woman slapped me, I felt the dirt from her hand on my face and I disinfected it a lot (my face), and that was I thought the end of it, to be honest I had diff things to be worried about. Now I don’t have panic attacks and my anxiety is more manageable, but I’ve noticed that in the past couple of months, I’ve been extremely stressed about dirt and germs, I can’t touch anything that I feel is dirty (literally everything, and I mean everything) the only thing I don’t view as dirty is my computer mice and my chair (I disinfect them every day) other than that, I feel like everything is dirty and full of viruses. I never want to sleep at a friends house, don’t want friends over and don’t want to go out, as you can tell this made my social life a lot worse. I hate going to school because that’s the place I feel like is the most dirty, I can’t wear shorts or tank tops or anything like that because I can feel my bare skin touching the dirty chair, table etc. I hate public transportation, I live in Europe, so public transportation is huge here, going to school, going to a market, going basically anywhere means using public transportation. So this made me isolate myself even more and every time I have to go to a bus or a train I get uncomfortable, disgusted dirty, or feel the viruses and bacteria on me and I get a breakdown. I wash my hands so much I got a really bad case of eczema, living with this is horrible and I want to get rid of this. So please, if you have any tips, let me know.

1c3r9i8;I don't really know anymore;mentlhealth;Man I don't really know where to begin with whats been going on. I feel like my life doesn't have any meaning and it never will, these past few days I've been rotting in bed instead of actually doing the things I need to do and I've suffer the consequences for it. My grades are rapidly dropping (I mean they weren't ever good to begin with but at least I got C's now all I get are D's and F's) And my family has decided to hate me for it. I don't feel like anyone really likes talking to me, it feels like every interaction I have with people is fake and artificial. I think I have autism since I've always felt different from the people around me and I've never felt like I truly belong somewhere. Every night I imagine what my brains would look like on my wall if I shot myself in the face. I also don't feel like I can ever do anything that makes anyone happy, everyone around me is all sad and gloomy and it effects my mood too. I've started so many projects that I never got to finish, like my mural that I started drawing on my wall which never even got to 30% completion or my youtube videos which I've scrapped or my numerous writing endeavors that went nowhere. I also have a very hard time trying to get a girlfriend, I mean I've been trying to get one for the past 3 or 4 years but it never seems like I get close. There was this one girl who I really liked and we had been texting on instagram for like 5 days in a row for over 2 hours each day. This got so far that I even scheduled a date but 2 or 3 days before the date I had to ruin it, cause I called her crazy as a joke, but it seems that she didn't take it as one, and I've been left on seen for the last 2 months, and even after I apologized with all my heart she still didn't reply and I think that bridge is already burnt. After a while of thinking I've come to the realization that I fall in love with every girl I meet, every girl no exceptions. It doesnt matter what they look like or how they act I just can't not fall in love with them and it hurts because theres this one girl that I have no chance with because she's 4 years older than me. She's the most beautiful girl I've seen in my entire life and I absolutely love her. I love everything about her, her smile, her face, her eyes, her hair, her body, her voice, the cute little sneezes she does but she keeps flirting with my other friends that are her age but never with me. And today me, her and another friend were walking and her and the friend held hands and I just walked behind them like a third wheel and It didn't feel nice, it felt very shitty and my head is a mess. Theres this other girl who I see at a bus stop I frequent and I finally managed to work up the courage to talk to her but then I don't know how to start conversations so even though I have her instagram we only talked once and I cant work up the courage to talk to her again. These past few years I've been floating around sort of like a ghost cause I haven't been able to get anything done, and all I do is sit on my computer and play video games instead of actually doing something productive with my life. Last year around june my father got cancer and I didn't find out about it till november of the same year. And yes the fact that he has cancer makes me sad but its so stupid that people act kind now when they know that my dad has cancer but when they see that I'm not doing well they don't really care. I feel really shitty admiting this but my father having cancer isn't something that makes me the saddest I can possibly be, it isn't even the saddest thing I'm currently experiencing as I think that I've never been happy my whole life. Yeah I smile every now and then and yeah I laugh here and there but I can't think of a time when I have been genuinely happy to be somewhere. I also feel a lot of guilt because when I was in kindergarten I tried to kiss a girl I liked while she was sleeping and I know that at such a young age I didn't know any better but to this day I haven't recovered from that and I still feel like a walking piece of shit because I did it. I also feel an indescribable loneliness which has been with me since the 1st grade. In 1st grade I used to get bullied so much that I would come home with bruises and that only stoped in the 4th grade. But I still didn't have any friends until one kid from my class befriended me and introduced me to his friends and we really hit it off and I felt like I was part of their group and to this day they're still very dear friends of mine, but we've grown distant and I fear that our friend group will melt like butter on a hot stove and we won't talk anymore. In the 7th grade the bullying started again and it was the worst it had ever been because it wasn't just physical but also mental. And at that time this friend group that I just talked about also made fun of me and it was horrible cause I was the laughing stock everywhere I went and its still exactly that way. Couple that with my parents also becoming abusive and not caring for my mental health and my sisters always backing them up on whatever they said and I was starting to feel like I was going to go insane. I then went on to highschool and it seems like the bullying follows me everywhere I go. They still make fun of me even though I'm in a comepletely different class with completely different people but they just won't stop making fun of me for some reason. I don't even do anything I just keep quiet and draw so I don't understand why they're making fun of me. They say that I smell bad or that I have greasy hair even though I shower every day. I'm soon going to be transfering to art school and hopefully being happy there but who knows what will happen. With art comes the fact that I'll probably be poor when I grow up and become an adult so of course I feel incredible anxiety at the realization that my life is probably not going to amount to anything. And i just want to say some more about the girl I like who's 4 years older than me. I think that my love for her is fruitless for it will amount to nothing because if I ever confess (which I never will because I confessed to a girl in the 6th grade and she didn't ever talk to me after that) her answer won't be a yes because she'll think that this whole time I've just been acting like her friend just to get into a relationship with her but I really do love being her friend. She is smart and likes the exact same stuff I like. Books, movies, games, shows, music, she is willing to listen to everything I say and she too has had a rough abusive life up until now and all I want to do is just hug her and tell her that it'll all be alright but I know that I can't do that. On top of all of this I feel really shitty since my imune system has been sort of lacking lately and I'm very sick. I think I suffer from depression and adhd and anxiety and autism but I can't really say for sure since I'm too scared to go to a psychiatrist since I find them kind of scary. I mean they would know everything about my life and I feel like thats just too much trust to put into a person. I know that its going to get better but I've really started to doubt that cause I've been suicidal for the past 3 or 4 years and it hasn't gotten any better. I also feel like I'm not really good at anything, my arts mediocre, I'm shit at video games and I don't succeed whenever I put my all into something. I recently got a pet bird for my birthday but he seems to not like me whatsoever even though its been a couple of months. Animals haven't ever really liked me but I really like them, I find them cool and interesting but alas they dislike me.;Man I don't really know where to begin with whats been going on.

1c3r52x;I have the feeling that something is wrong with me. Am I a high functioning depressed?;notsofriendlyuser;I don’t understand what is happening. Two years ago, I had a bad depressive episode with suicidal thoughts and all the good stuff, from which I literally recovered all by myself. One day I touched the bottom, I was fired from my job and I decided to… don’t be like that anymore. I know it sounds weird or stupid, but it worked. I came back to normal, more or less, and I put my life back on tracks.   Now I suspect that actually I did not fully recover, but only swiped everything under the rug. I look normal, I work, meet people, do activities, I can be funny and extrovert.   Sometimes when I stop, I feel deep sadness or I start crying uncontrollably for no reason, out of the blue. My life is very emotionally flat, I don’t feel a lot and I don’t care about almost anything. I tell myself that it is just my character, I’m just very cool about most things. I feel like I’m a very cold person. I have big difficulties in picking up hobbies, to the point that I have none. I am not really interested in anything. I have less appetite, but in a normal way. I eat, I want some specific foods but I am immediately full and I grow tired of them. And I am scared of everything, speed, heights, plane, skiing…   I actively avoid people, never engaging in contacts with others and for this reason, I have no friends. I just don’t feel the need of social contact and I don’t see the point, because most people do not really care. When I am forced in social activities that I can’t avoid, I complain and dread the moment a lot but then I am even able to be funny and extrovert. Looking at me, I just look basic but not problematic or depressed. But I am starting to feel that there is something wrong in all of this. Technically there is no problem and I got so much better than two years ago. I even got promoted at work and I have a good salary and a comfortable life. But this is not the person I want to be.

1c3q9f7;My life so far.... Stop by and read if you can. Thank you;Competitive_Hold_258;I am a 20 year old guy and I don't know where my life is going.I have no friends, never had a girlfriend, no guidance or future planning and I am just too tired. No dreams or ambitions because I have lost interest in life. I have been going through depression, anxiety and loneliness for the past 6 years and it just keeps getting worse.I grew up in not a very friendly environment. Parents used to fight every other day over something, even witnessed some domestic violence. Dad was always out with his friends drinking and smoking and never really cared about me much. About 4 years ago my parents seperated for about 8 months but not an official divorce, they got back but those 8 months scarred me for life. Me and my brother were living with our mom during that time so I had to act like a father to my younger sibling and take responsibilities and my academic performance deteriorated. I was a good above average student, not the brightest but the last 4 years of school really took a toll on me because of all the bullying I endured. When schools went online due to covid I completely isolated myself from everyone and lost every single bit of social skill I had. I somehow passed school, it's been 2 years and I still fucking despise it because of all the traumatic experience I had.No interests, no planning I started giving entrance exams for colleges. I didn't even take a break after school my parents just forced me into college. I chose programming and now 2 years into college I realise that I fucking hate my major and now I am just dragging myself till I graduate.College has taken a toll on me too, I spend half of my day in college and when I am home I have no energy left to do anything. I was into gym and lifting but I found it so hard to do it along with college and at the same time my parents only want me to study 24/7 so they discouraged me from going to the gym and eventually..... I had to quit the gym. As of today I have lost all progress I made in the gym and now I hate looking at myself in the mirror.Gym was my favourite hobby and coping method. Other than that I used to play video games. Now that the gym was gone I could only rely on video games. However last year in December my pc started crashing alot and turns out my graphics card died. Can't afford a new graphics card now so now the video games are gone too....What now? Now all I do is drinking and smoking and I feel disgusted with myself because that was the reason I hated my dad in the first place and now I have stooped so low in life and it's only the 4th month of the year.I have tried making friends in college, gym or just going out but there is just something off which I can't explain. It's like I can't build relationships anymore I fail to make myself important in others' life. Everyone knows me but no one really cares about me. I get no calls, no messages, I am just rotting in my room all day. Home to college, college to home and days are just passing by and I am losing touch day by day.I can't focus anymore, I have exams from tomorrow and I haven't studied anything because my mind is full of these thoughts and alcohol and anxiety. I have to keep myself busy at all times to resist these thoughts but is it even healthy to keep yourself occupied 24/7 just to avoid your thoughts and panic attacks especially after losing my hobbies like gym and video games. I have no one to talk to, I feel extremely lonely and despite of my numerous attempts I can't fit in with people of my age group. I am just living my miserable life watching others enjoy, go out, make progress, lose their virginity etc. I don't like to call my life miserable because there are people who probably have it even worse so it makes me feel like I am being a bitch ranting about my small problems so I am just bottling up keeping everything inside me. I drink alone and lose senses for some time to escape reality that's the only thing that makes me feel good at this point.I don't know where my life is going and I feel so numb that I can't even express emotions anymore. I don't wanna live anymore but don't wanna die too. I don't know what I am supposed to do I am just battling anxiety, depression, loneliness and mood swings all the time. The affects of smoking/drinking have also started to show up, I can feel my physical health going down too. I guess one way or the other I will end up taking my life like this.Thank you for your time❤️ I hope you have a great day.;I am a 20 year old guy and I don't know where my life is going.I have no friends, never had a girlfr;Venting;0;1;2024-04-14 10:15:40;2024-04-14;Sunday;10:15:40;4462;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:55.423764
1c3p6rx;tough life my life is ruined;theonlysamay;"hello my name is Salazar(made up name). It's been a long time since I am suffering Mentally and now physically too. In around January or February of 2023, I proposed a girl and got rejected, well that's not I was depressed about then, but because of those trolls and all, by my classmates(I am in school btw). I am still sometimes being trolled about it. I was so depressed and weak then that I started seeking cheap pleasures like watching pornography and fapping. Although after a short time only I understood that fapping is not good so I started to quit it, but I could not. It's been more than a year since I am trying to completely quit it and desexualizing my brain. Well after all that troll thing, my mother's health was no good and her health keeps debriciate often, although she is very much fine now. After her health, I started writing diary entries and when they turned into so negative things I had no idea. I once wrote a $uic!de note just to express all of it, and it was found. It made a lot of scene but hopefully ended soon, people forgot it. Then at January 2024, one morning I felt extreme pain in my abdomen area, I was rushed to the hospital. I was admitted for 2 days and it kinda fixed. But when I went home, it got worse. I went to the hospital again. There two doctors said I have something called epididymitis, and a doctor privately, silently asked me ""Have you started masturbating?"" I have too scared to tell, I said no. They told two apply some ice pack on the right testis(where it was swollen) and it will be fine. But it was... you'll find out. I stayed at home or a week in rest and there was no change. So we went to a physician and they gave a number of an andrologist. We went to his hospital and met him and he told us that we are basically scammed and I was suffering from testicular torsion.

1c3lubs;I’m having a mental breakdown - inpatient???!;DAR1978;Summary of my life.  I am leaving a lot of the details out in and attempt to keep this short .  Married 23 yearsWhen we met I was 15 he was 223 amazing sonsExtreme mental abuse, manipulationBecame progressively worseResearched it - really think he has NPD so started to put strategies in place to protect myself but was determined to stay because:A, he was an amazing dad (so I thought)B, i was afraid and did think I had  optionsOut of the blue, he is charged w indecent a&b on a minor under the age of 14… my sons bff.  Mom was one of my closest friends.  They were neighbors and fled.  Sold Their house.He spun a tale which I fell for and became furious at the mom. Hired a $10k attyHe was so awful even when I was supportive.  I has been conditioned since I was 16 and was now 44.Court came.  No idea why, but for some reason, he shared the court documents with me which included a full history of his criminal past. The moment I looked at it, I knew I had been living a complete lie. Not only did he lie to me about something that happened before we were even married in 1996. but I discovered that he was the reason that I lost my dearest, most incredibly closest bestest friend in my entire life along with her family who were like my family back in 2012. He had given me a completely different story and I believed it. She thought I knew the truth and I thought she knew the same story. As I continued to read, There was more the issue with the little girl that was the victim in this most recent incident which he was now being charged with.  I knew immediately she nwas very evidently telling the truth, and every single thing that he told me was very obviously a lie. I knew immediately that this man was an awful person and he was not who I thought he was. Within 15 minutes of reading that document I told him I was leaving him. fast-forward lots lots of things occurred between the time he left, and now, namely, his promises to his sons to be part of their lives, went completely unfounded, and he has essentially ghosted all of them. He has held money from me for many months. He did just completely terrible things to me. ultimately, I decided to support the little girl that was claiming he had abused her and I decided to take the stand against him. This just happened and it was a hung jury. I don’t believe he will go to jail for this awful crime and I am incredibly fearful that he will do it again. In fact, I’m certain he will. I was able to reconnect with my girlfriend from 12 years ago, which was absolutely amazing. However, in this process of healing, you must all know that there are certain things that come about that you need to work through and some things you knew were there and some things are epiphany that you just really didn’t think about and lots of them are things that you suppressed to the point of complete and utter denial of the situation. So as I’ve been working on really trying to help the victims and learning their awful stories, I thought about my own history of abuse. and I decided to do a video journal of all of the abuse I’ve sustained in my life. I am adamantly wanting to change the system, and that was part of it. I wanted to understand why I never said anything about the multiple times I’ve been abused in my life. And then, as I was sitting there doing this video diary all of a sudden something popped in my head and it has thrown me over the edge and I don’t know what to do. I think I completely separated this I completely put this out of my mind.  I feel so completely scared and out of control. Essentially what happened many many times was I would be woken up in bed and I was being raped by this man that was my husband. He did it on a reoccurring basis. It was awful.  I take a sleeping aid and he told me it was just so sad that I was drugged up and didn’t know I was being raped.  What made it even more awful was that one of the things that he did to manipulate and control me for years, was to withhold sexual relationships with me, and he did that for many years. There were nights that he literally would put his CPAP mask on. He would put the covers over his face while I balled my eyes out and told me it was just too bad I should’ve known better. This was the man I married. so to be raped in the middle of the night by a man that won’t make love to you when you’re willing and able hit hard. The crux of why I am making this post: I am really struggling and I truly do believe with all the things that have happened in my life this particular situation the rape has thrown me over the edge and I feel like I am having a mental breakdown. I don’t know what to do. My employer does not offer paidFMLA because I work at a school. And I can’t afford to take time off of work. I do have a option through my union to request a sick bank which I will do, but I don’t know what to do to get the help I need. I feel like I need an intensive inpatient program where I can have very intense therapy. Everywhere I look seems to only have outpatient and I just don’t know what to do. What’s the best way to go about this? I have Mass Health standard and I live in Massachusetts. I need help. I need to figure out how to get to the bottom of this. I am not functioning. I am not able to successfully complete my job. I am not sleeping. I am yelling at people. I completely avoid everything that I should be paying attention to. I am completely disassociating from anything that requires an emotional connection. I am not able. My ADHD is all over the place. I am feeling like I am spinning out of control. I’m barely sleeping. I’m barely eating and this is all happened so very suddenly like within the last week or so I am not myself, I don’t know how to get myself comfortable and this is new and it’s intense and while I do not feel like I am ever going to hurt myself I am knowing that I am in an awful mental place so is anybody able to help me understand what I can do to get some help and do you think that inpatient is the best way to go? I think I would get approval through my sick bank at work. But do you have any other suggestions on how I would be paid? Is there other options grants I don’t know I’m scared out of my mind and I just know I need to get better and I need to do something about this if you’ve gotten to the end of this very long post thank you, and I really appreciate any help. Any of you can give me.;Summary of my life.  I am leaving a lot of the details out in and attempt to keep this short .

1c3ljfg;My dad blamed his suicide on my mom - has anyone else experienced this?;ActiveMuffin7801;My dad committed suicide and blamed my mother in his suicide note. They were married for 37 years and 11 months. He had some trauma happen in his last few years, lots of death of immediate family members and he was told he had lung cancer. There’s a lot of external factors that would have made him feel hopeless at the end of his life. Being of that generation where he didn’t know how to ask for mental help didn’t make matters easier for him either. I could tell the whole story but I am just looking for anyone who has experienced something similar. It’s not the fact he is gone, it’s the fact I see the things he blamed my mom for much clearer now and I struggle to relate to her. Obviously she is a widow now and I want to believe it had nothing to do with her but I loved and trusted my dad more than anyone. His words make me resent my mother and I just can’t figure out what to do about this. She is the typical Jewish smothering parent who calls/emails/texts at least once a day and I just can’t stand her dissonance around his death. She takes no responsibility for his words and refuses to change her personality. I struggle to see how I am supposed to just be okay with her in my life anymore, it’s overbearing and she won’t even see a family counsellor with me. Anyone’s thoughts are appreciated. I don’t want to hold a grudge, I struggle to see his death as a single event that has nothing to do my mother.

1c3ksmf;I'm doing something terrible.;Historical_Act7365;"STORYTIME: So, about a month ago I decided to try out this anonymous call app. I did it because even though I am in a long-term relationship, things have been absolutely terrible and just constantly going downhill, so I really wanted someone to talk to without the commitment, I guess. It wasn't intended to be romantic or anything, just someone to chat with for fun. The app was not going great since most of the guys were pervs but there is an auto-call that is on so as soon as I decided to hang up it auto-called someone who actually seemed normal. We started talking and I realized he was super funny and just all-round fun to talk to. That conversation led to us being on the phone for almost 5 hours. We swapped social medias and decided to talk again. Mind you, he does not know that I have a boyfriend. Now, I will be honest, when I was on the app introducing myself, I lied my ass off. I told the guy I lived somewhere I did not, my job was completely different than what is actually is etc. At first, I did it because honestly, I'm not sure of who I'm talking to, and I thought it was the safest approach but then I realized I was technically living out my dreams. Talking about myself the way I hope to be in a few years, I guess. It was like an escape from my shitty reality.Anyways, fast forward to now, the guy and I have been talking this entire time for hours on end. No less than 3 hours every night. He lives in a whole different state, still does not know I have a boyfriend and still thinks I'm the person who I said I was from our initial conversation. I could have come clean from our second talk, but I did not think it was going to lead to this. We do talk about very romantic things and every time we get off the phone, I'm always sad because he likes me so much and the feelings are mutual, but he likes a version of me that does not exist. What makes it worse is that if I could have created my own ""perfect"" boyfriend, it would absolutely be him. He is literally everything I always wanted out of a guy personality wise AND he is super attractive, but I know that it is never going to progress because of my lies and the fact that he does not even know the real me. Every day I keep telling myself I'm going to come clean and tell him the truth, but he makes me feel so fucking happy bro like I literally don't want it to end but I know it has to.";STORYTIME: So, about a month ago I decided to try out this anonymous call app. I did it because even;Venting;1;1;2024-04-14 04:19:00;2024-04-14;Sunday;04:19:00;2376;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 21:04:55.444402

1c3hcmq;How hard is it to get ECT? How willingly is it prescribed and how available is it? Will Medicare pay?;evermorex76;"Short version: Can I go to a psychiatrist, provide them my history, and potentially have them immediately refer me for ECT? Will they only do it if you're absolutely untreatable and totally crippled with mental illness? Would Medicare cover it aside from a copay? Is it generally available in most areas?I've had treatment resistant depression for over 30 years, plus ADHD, anxiety and multiple other mental health issues that can't be treated with medication, most of which weren't actually diagnosed until I was 45. On and off treatment for over 20, briefly inpatient during a suicidal episode (and avoided it at other times by hiding what was happening; I've been masking for a LONG time). I've been on over 20 psychiatric medications, most of the SSRI and SNRI and NDRI types (the affordable ones and a few of the stupidly expensive ones) plus anti-psychotics and adjunctive stuff. Therapy/counseling is not effective for me and the medications are terrible. I get the bad side-effects almost immediately on the low starting dose, which get worse as the dose goes up, but until I'm maxed out on the allowed dosage I don't get anything that could be called beneficial, and that only means having my emotions dulled so that I can't feel much of anything.I've also gone through extended treatment with TMS and got no benefit, and started with ketamine infusions but the high cost and seeming lack of response made me stop. (In general, I don't respond to most medications very strongly, OTC or prescription, and have to take high doses.)I go through long ups and downs that seem unrelated to whether I'm on medication or not. For several years I was doing tolerably well unmedicated, not happy but functional and could hide it. About 7 years ago it started to get bad again, and I started treatment which was again not effective, and a few years ago I began to outright plummet and it was affecting my work to the point I lost my job a little over 2 years ago. The first time I ever got fired (for job abandonment after many months of them being very accommodating and then I just stopped going to work for two weeks). I've been trying to get disability since then, and I've attempted treatment with two different providers since then that wasn't helping, and I'm hoping that within the next couple of weeks I'll get a positive decision from the judge after two denials. Then I should have Medicare.I want to start some sort of treatment as soon as I can, though I've read it might be even harder to find a provider with Medicare than regular insurance. I'm willing to try pretty much any treatment that might be a major change from just throwing another medication at it. Whenever I go to a doctor now, they look at my medication list and say ""Huh, you've tried everything I can think of"" and then ask me what I'd like to try. The last one was supposed to be consulting with another about possibly even going to MAOIs despite the problems they have, out of desperation, but she didn't work out.I'm at the point that if I had the money, I'd pay out of pocket for ECT, which seemingly could end up costing $25,000 or more for a full stretch of treatments, assuming outpatient. But I don't have that kind of cash. I'm being supported by family right now (the only thing leaving me any dignity at all is that it's coming out of my future inheritance). I don't want to just keep trying little things, a different medication that will take months to judge, sitting in therapy that isn't going to help. I need something drastic. But I don't know if I can go to a new doctor (or possibly a previous one) and tell them what I've been through and have them refer me for ECT, or if they're going to insist on trying a bunch of other stuff unless I tell them I'm suicidal or so disabled by it that I can't even eat or clean myself, to the point that they might be required to have me committed.";Short version: Can I go to a psychiatrist, provide them my history, and potentially have them immedi;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-14 01:05:35;2024-04-14;Sunday;01:05:35;3884;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 15:18:33.989210

1c3gmhv;How can I help my dad?;Silvera_17;Hi everyone! My father is a depressed mess. He just beat cancer and it’s about to have a reversal surgery for his ostomy in a few weeks. He has always had depression and anxiety issues, has had a lot happen to him that would certainly make him this way, but there’s so much good in his life right now. He refuses to leave his room, let any light in, do anything to make himself feel better. He ponders all day about the stuff that bothers him and needs my mom with him every second or else he gets suicidal. Problem is, we are all there for him and it’s not enough. He doesn’t believe in therapy or even a temporary medication that will get him over this hump. He refuses anything of the sort. He thinks we are all he needs but we literally can’t be there enough. We do our very best.I would love some tips, what therapists do. I’d like to replace that role subliminally and help him out in a professional matter. I want to engage him, help him talk (even though I have heard it all) and give him solid advice. I try but some suggestions are even offensive. Some stuff he feels like we don’t understand or get how he feels. We certainly do, I have felt the same as him and have overcome it in a way that is not possible for him. For those who have had a therapist help them overcome severe depression, how did they do it? He doesn’t get over the past. He can’t get over my brother and I moving out even though we see him nearly every day. We visit him even though we both have a family of our own. He is constantly making ideas that one day we will all get together like old times, like where our family spend the night and wake up to the sound of my brother and I tormenting each other. He even asks on cue that we do that. We all joke and might light of the situation but they are unrealistic ideas as we literally have our own family’s to care for and we all work full time jobs.A lot of stuff would be a “you just have to let it go” situation but that is one of those things that would be offensive and might send him into a suicidal frenzy.Thank you everyone in advance for any advice and tips.;Hi everyone!

1c3fq7u;Anxiety and lack of confidence in friendships ;Parking-Ad2782;I'm a 28 year old male who has trouble with friendships. Back story, I don't have much confidence, I was fairly overweight my whole childhood. My dad died when I was 21. I'm at a somewhat better place in life now, lost a lot of weight exercise often and hold a full time job in one career, however switching to another career hopefully soon. At work I have zero problems socializing and am extremely confident, no anxiety in that. However I don't have many friends outside of my jobs- not really from school or college. I recently became friends with someone who I am anxiously attached to because we're at really different points in life, he's older and has kids. I think all the time that I'm being ignored if I'm not answered within a few hours and just that this person doesn't want to actually be friends despite them giving no actual indication of that. I'll see them active on Instagram and just not answering me which makes me feel shitty. They do pretty much always eventually answer. I fear he's eventually going to just cut me out because of my anxious behavior about the friendship. This all sounds so lame and stupid, I just kind of was really anxious last night and expressed it to them after they told me a week ago that they don't want to hear it anymore because they've addressed it multiple times. Now I feel like they're going to just ignore me for good even tho I don't actually think that'll happen - I just want to know how to act like a normal person in a friendship.Any advice?

1c3ev2v;Mental struggle with me (22f) and my bf (23m);ThrowRAkittygurll3;So for context, we've been together for 3 years. Everything is usually great but as of late, my bf who has severe trauma from his past was constantly paranoid and obsessed over his previous job, let's call it the factory (it wasn't actually a factory). But anyway, the people there really messed with him and bullied him and it got to a point where he was so triggered every new job he got was a scheme planned by the factory trying to ruin his life or get the cops involved. He was convinced the cops were going to arrest him bc of thr factory's scheme for a crime I'm 100% sure for a fact he did not commit. This has been going on for almost 7-8 months now and it got worse and worse no matter how much I consoled him nothing was good enough.Everyone of his friends and family members has told him he needs therapy and he's delusional. He's finally going to therapy now but had only had one appointment and is taking sertraline and hydroxzine as needed. When we first met he was never like this. This problem is very recent and came out of nowhere but i feel he had been pushing therapy off for past trauma for way too long then it all came to a head and he exploded. I feel like recently everything has been put on me to deal with his problems and delusions and i love him but I can't handle feeling like he's making all his problems including my own problems all my responsibility. It got to the point where I am now planning to move out of our apartment for potentially up to one month to take a break bc I can't handle this anymore. Hes getting help now.His behavioral specialist wants to test him for adhd which is known to be linked to paranoia and overthinking. He tried adderall the last 3 days and we both. Noticed a decent improvement in his mood and ability to work without being bothered.When he's not irritable or obsessively paranoid he's a great loving boyfriend and we get along well.I'm just very confused and don't know what to do, as I've found out his crazy/narcissistic  father has been just this way on and off throughout his life.I don't know if I can imagine a life with someone who can flip on a dime like that and potentially lose it for no reason and it only happens when he goes into work.He will be going to hypnotherapy soon to try and rewire his brain but I'm still unsure.I feel so horrible bc I really love this man and don't know what to do... any advice is appreciated!;So for context, we've been together for 3 years.

1c3dg8j;Do i have ocd?;Greenavacado11;I am 15f and i think that i might have ocd but aren’t sure and don’t know what to do or if there is medication to help stop it. When i was younger (around 8 or 9) i remember that i was really scared of jumping for some reason and there was this table in the living room and one day i just stood on it and in my head said “if u dont jump off in 3 seconds your mum dies” obviously she wouldn’t die but i was extremely scared and even though i knew she wouldn’t ,i jumped off and kept going back on and my brain kept saying different people were going too die: my uncle,my brother, my cousin,my nan ect. Simular things have happened throughout the years but its not happened enough too really effect my life. The thing that has been taking up hours of my day every day and makes me really concerned is that for example if i see a t-shirt i want too buy i will sit there and just talk about it with myself for ages and then go looking for more of the same style. Same thing applies too literally anything i want. My little brother always moves his placemat diagonal and instead of ignoring it i literally want to sl!t my wrists because of how much it annoys me and i just want it too be straight and perfect. Same applies too if i go in a room and one thing is wrong i have too fix it and because my brother doesn’t let me it REALLY just like hurts my brain and i cant explain it really but it does.i have a fear of fire and before i leave the house i check multiple times too see if i have turned off anything that could cath fore and one night i was at a sleepover and it was around 2:30 am and my friend was asleep and i randomly thought “what if i didnt turn off the switch so i got out of bed and it was turned off but i am just so scared that one day i will leave it on and cause a fire.Whenever my mum goes out i will be fine and then randomly i will think”what if..””what if..” and call her and get all worried. months ago in December my brother made a strange face and that image would not leave my brain and i know  it seems like nothing but it would not go away no matter what i did. I love going into boscome and i went with my family too get hot chocolates and have a nice day but i still could not get rid off that image. It wasn’t for a day. Wasn’t for a month. It was for 2 and a half months. Every morning i would wake up and see that image and it would be there ALL THE TIME. I did this thing where i would say “1,2,3 now we stop thinking about it” but it soon came back seconds later. Then i did this thing where i would roll my eyes back and shake and vibrate my whole body. Didnt work. I couldn’t even watch a movie without thinking about it and almost ever night for hours i would be up,wondering if it would come back the next day. I did everything too try avoiding it but nothing seemed too work and i even wanted too k!ll myself because of how much it was effecting my life. Luckily one day i was googling again like i did every day and this video on youtube popped up “how too stop constant thoughts and images” i watched it and the man who made the video said too say too yourself that you don’t care about it. At first this sounded stupid and at first it did not work but after around 5 or 6 days i FINALLY got rid of it!

I'm almost always stressed and anxious, or depressed, my mood fluctuates throughout the day, and I do get impulsive suicidal thoughts, and my thoughts, values and worldview, perspectives are coloured by all of these things.  I have tried sertraline, two or three times, without any noticeable effect, other than giving side effects, and flattening my affect a bit., I have tried Buspirone which made my anxiety worse, and had terrible side effects, and it was awful coming off of it. atomoxetine lessened my anxiety a bit, but did not sleep for the whole timeI was on it, and I had horrible constipations and drying out my mucous membranes causing me to constantly get anal fissures and bleed from my bum...  Concerta made me have have a really bad trip the whole week I was on it, thought I should die.

At work I have zero problems socializing and am extremely confident, no anxiety in that. However I don't have many friends outside of my jobs- not really from school or college. I recently became friends with someone who I am anxiously attached to because we're at really different points in life, he's older and has kids. I think all the time that I'm being ignored if I'm not answered within a few hours and just that this person doesn't want to actually be friends despite them giving no actual indication of that. I'll see them active on Instagram and just not answering me which makes me feel shitty. They do pretty much always eventually answer. I fear he's eventually going to just cut me out because of my anxious behavior about the friendship. This all sounds so lame and stupid, I just kind of was really anxious last night and expressed it to them after they told me a week ago that they don't want to hear it anymore because they've addressed it multiple times. Now I feel like they're going to just ignore me for good even tho I don't actually think that'll happen - I just want to know how to act like a normal person in a friendship.Any advice?

1c3b4bi;I have been depressed since 2015;sushii19;Hello everyone,I am from India, I am writing this post just to vent. I got depressed during my college when I had to study a major which I started hating after one semester, my parents gave me an even worse option if I quit, so I sucked it up and completed my course which was of four years. Every single day I wanted to kill myself because I hated my life there. I started reading Friedrich Nietzsche and similar authors and went into extreme depression when I came back home after completing my degree. I also had a failed relationship in 2015 which took a major toll on my mental health and made me feel like I am not good enough, she told me that if her parents found out that she is dating, it would be huge problem because of caste issue. After that I just kinda gave up on everything. Also, two other girls approached me in 2018 and 2019 but I did not reciprocate at all. My parents did not understood my mental state and wanted me do a master's degree(MBA) so I started preparing for it. Got into a college and started having anxiety attacks, got diagnosed with depression and started taking meds for it, got a job after my master's but left it in 3 months because they changed my profile and used to abuse and use extremely bad language there. Right now, I have another job in hand but I don't feel happy anymore, i always keep thinking about the past and hate myself. Videogames and books and the things that got me through college and I still play videogames to distract myself but recently I am getting extremely suicidal and I don't know what to do. Life does not seem worth living anymore because nothing works out for me.;Hello everyone,I am from India, I am writing this post just to vent.

1c3awzp;I dont know how to enjoy things.;Salt-Tomorrow8686;I always want my life to get better or something/someone good to come my way, but when it does I'm just always afraid. I'm afraid that everything will disappear. This is stemmed from my abandonment and trust issues, along with me getting attached to something very easily. These combinations are literally the worst thing ever, cus I get the rush of happiness for one sec, the next sec I'm just filled with despair.When I'm by myself I'm always thinking of all the worst possible outcomes for the ones I love. What if they left me? What if they get in an accident? What if they are just using me? What if they killed themselves?I dont know what to do to make these thoughts stop, and even if I do, what if these thoughts become reality? Anything can happen, and being told to just relax doesn't help cus everytime I do, things doesn't go the way I want.Now I can't live my life properly cus I'm just in constant fear. I hate the future, I hate myself. I'm at a point where I don't want things to get better, I just want everything good in my life to be gone so I can end myself for good. And now I'm having thoughts of acting like an asshole to everyone I ever had to make them hate me. So they'll be happy when I'm gone.I still have many things to lose if I kill myself right now, and call me delusional but I believe in reincarnation and other realities. I just wanna redo life, I wanna be reborn as a privileged person, live an easy and happy life with everything I want.People say that those kinds of person have less value than regular people, kinda like you either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain. But I don't care if I became a shallow person in the process, I just wanna feel happy. I suffer so much, and for what? To be humble? To get stronger? For what?My life isnt perfect right now, but I am content with it. But somewhere in the future if anything were to go wrong again I think I would lose it.I dont know what to do to stop worrying.;I always want my life to get better or something/someone good to come my way, but when it does I'm j;Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm;0;1;2024-04-13 20:10:24;2024-04-13;Saturday;20:10:24;1965;Reddit;mentalhealth;mentalhealth;2024-04-17 15:18:34.919234

She will say something out of the blue like “I fucking hate myself” and we will go back and forth for actual hours and she will go on about how she is terrible and she isn’t worth loving and that she doesn’t care anymore and I will just keep telling her that she is loved and I’ve written paragraphs of these heartfelt messages to her and she will just be like “I don’t care, I’m a terrible person, you should leave me” and it just goes on and on because we are both stubborn. I know she cares so much and she loves me, and when this happens I’m afraid to give her space because I’m afraid that she will seriously hurt herself. She tells me that she can’t promise me that she won’t hurt herself. What am I supposed to do really? She will leave me on cliffhangers like “I’m sorry” and I ask if she’s safe and she will leave me on delivered and get annoyed with me when I call her. I just feel mistreated, I can’t tell her about anything because the last time I tried to communicate about a minor thing she had a panic attack. I am and have been a brick wall for her. I’m doing my best but I find myself doubting if i can keep this up. I’m not going to leave her.

I broke down twice in front of my parents but on both occasions they only made it worse. I fell in love with this girl, we are best friends and she's the most trustable, understanding person I have in my life. And that's mutual. I finally gathered courage to open up about my depression to her last month. She cried and gave me comfort words and tried to help me out of it verbally. But it wasn't enough. I had some fleeting s thoughts last week. When I told her about it, she's feeling so much guilt and disappointment that her help wasn't enough for me. Now she's just sending out generic comfort messages to me, complete shift in how she usually talks. It's like she's trying to distance herself from me. I hate how this is happening. I don't know what to do. There's a reason why I feel not to open up to people because I'm scared they won't be able to handle it and run away. And now the person whom I trusted, who understands me so much, is doing the same. I don't think she's right here. It's hurting me like hell on top of my depression. I don't know what to do.

That I have been long forgotten and people moved on. Everyday I meet the same people, people that I love, hate and people I wish the most violent death to. But they all ignore me, I don't even know why, it's true that I live and still and will for a long time in a village, where I am basically alone. No friends, no pets, nothing. I am alone as a person can be, the only thing that keeps me company is miles upon miles of of fields. The only moment I am happy is when I can lay down in middle of one and lay there for hours straight just relaxing, I am so alone that I have grown to basically hate human contact, I despise people even though I want their attention, I guess I hate people because they don't care about me... I don't feel sad, I don't feel happy, I may have depression but I doubt it, I always lie to myself that I'm fine and that I don't need help, but sometimes, well basically always feel like I deserve this. Since birth I was bound to have no friends, I once had. But he was here in this shithole because he just went to his grandma during the summer and after few days, my friend was gone. I think about suicide a lot lately, but every time I imagine my family being sad because of me, I wouldn't let that happen, even though I am kinda distant to them I still couldn't forgive myself making them feel like this.
