1c8jfnh;Well this sucks;use_err_named;Hey y’all, it’s been 75 days (I asked chat GPT to calculate it). Like the title says, this sucks. The last 3 days have been bad days. Having to deal with other people’s problems at work amplifies my grief. Being compassionate and caring about others can be exhausting. (Especially when it’s trivial shit) It seems fuckin crazy that people just continue, and are expected to continue, with life after experiencing these losses. My boyfriend just killed himself and society expects us to give a shit about bullshit, like selling a product for a company that would replace you in a heartbeat. It’s insane. I wish I could quit, but I need to make a living to pay my bills and take care of my dogs. I’ll end up in the streets if I don’t work. I guess I still care enough to not live in the streets. That’s good, I guess. Anyway, I’m sure a lot of you can relate. You’re not alone. This is painful. I know. And it sucks. But we’ve made it this far        (•◡•) / (he would text me that little thing  when he was excited for me to get home) Hopefully I feel better tomorrow.

1c8hav5;Just angry. ;RaeBaeee-95;I found my little sister after her suicide about 2 years ago. She hung herself. She knew I’d find her. I’m just still so angry she left me with this image for the rest of my life. The daily flashbacks are horrible. I now can’t let anything touch my neck, clothes, people, nothing. Don’t breathe on my neck. I don’t want to remotely feel what my sister felt in her last moments. My boyfriend doesn’t know how she passed. I told him when we first started dating that I can’t have him touch my neck but didn’t tell him why. He is super respectful of this but has forgotten twice. The first time I sobbed for nearly 2hrs. I could only profusely apologize because I felt bad for making him feel bad about something that was completely an accident. He was just trying to turn my face to kiss me goodnight. I’m in therapy but curious if anyone else deals with something similar. How do I get over this?And when does this anger change to a different feeling? It’s been almost 2 years. 😞;I found my little sister after her suicide about 2 years ago. She hung herself.

1c89pf1;Anger at how they acted before the loss?;OkBalance2833;sorry for a second post in a day and I’ll possibly end up deleting this because I don’t know how I feel about it allI don’t really know how to process some of the ways I was treated before we lost him. To be clear this stuff wasn’t all the time and with what I know now, it makes a lot more sense but loving someone suffering with addiction. If you’ve been through it then yeah, it’s a lot sometimes. I’ve mentioned in previous posts we argued a lot leading up to it and it’s because I straight up got treated like shit some of the time. Drugs picked over me and our son, getting shouted at, missing for days on benders, constantly let down, money getting tight, times where I knew he was on coke but made to genuinely believe I was crazy and he wasn’t but he was I wasn’t crazy. Times some really horrible stuff got said, I spent a lot of nights crying because of stuff said and done. Never ever put his hands on me but he knew what to say to fuck my head up.Don’t get me wrong, I know drugs change people and it was the affect of drugs on him that changed him. A lot of the time he was the man I loved, I’ve been apologised too a ridiculous amount of times, there was PLENTY of good times but it’s still hurt me but now I don’t know how to process it because I don’t want to be angry at a dead man, I still completely love him and genuinely it was drugs that changed him. Before he tried them on a stupid night out with mates and it spiralled he was never like this, he was the good side of him all the time.Do I just need to look at the whole picture of what’s ended up happening and realise this is nothing in it, get over it?;sorry for a second post in a day and I’ll possibly end up deleting this because I don’t know how I f;;5;6;2024-04-19 22:19:06;2024-04-19;Friday;22:19:06;1630;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.489370

1c83xyk;It’s been two months-;peeta_is_useless;It’s now the 19th of April. My dad killed himself the 19th of February. I can’t look at Mondays the same. I can’t look at the 19th the same. It’s that day all over again.We turned in his phone and let them cancel his number. I still text it, even if he won’t ever respond again. Sometimes it’s “I love you” other times it’s just a stupid thing about the hockey game. It feels ridiculous. I feel like I’m going crazy. I have people around me that went through the same event, but they don’t understand how I feel. I don’t know how to explain to them what’s happening to me. I sleep with his favorite sweater and a familiar t-shirt he wore when I was little. My mom and brother think it’s unhealthy. There are other random things I do for myself because I just want to feel near him- I know they’re not trying to be hurtful but I feel insane when she tells me things like that because I don’t want to stop. My therapist actually validates what I do which makes me feel better, but she’s not the person I live with and see every day. I’m exhausted. I sleep for 8 hours most every night and never feel like I slept at all. Everything feels so much harder. I can’t concentrate. I struggle to get through a chapter of a book.

1c7znzc;Worried about my sister ;WhoknowsAnymore511;Almost a week ago my brother (23) committed suicide and my sister found his body in the woods. It was bloody and messy and she’s traumatized. Not only were they extremely close in age (she just turned 25 last week), but she also basically raised him as my mom wasn’t really present in their household and that really felt like her first child for her. I’m not sure what to do, I’m really worried. She has a daughter that’s 6 that I’ve been taking care of all week while I’m visiting home from out of state to help with funeral things and to grieve myself. But she’s a single mom and my niece’s father isn’t trustworthy to take care of her properly. I leave this upcoming Friday and can’t take anymore leave from work to help.I guess I’m just looking for some tips to help her get out of the deep hole she’s in. I know grieving can’t be expedited, but she doesn’t have a very big support system here so she will have to go back to being a single mom as soon as I leave. Is there any way/any support groups anyone knows about to help with this sort of thing so she doesn’t feel completely alone? Are their any tips to help with the trauma of finding someone? I’ve been trying to help her set little goals but it’s hard because she won’t really pick up the phone or leave her boyfriends house.She’s also in a fairly new relationship so I’m also trying to help her be mindful of her new boyfriends emotional capacity because I don’t want him to get burnt out and leave because it’s too much.

1c7tm76;Tips on going back to work ;PinkPossum161;"My girlfriend died on Sunday evening. I got the news on Monday morning. Since then I feel like I'm trapped in a never-ending nightmare. Days are awful and nights bring no peace, since I dream of her.She sent me money right before she ended her life. The transfer title was ""so you can take leave"". She knew in my job we don't have sick days or paid leave. She probably wanted to give me some time to grieve her. However, I just don't want this money. I want her to be here with me. I doesn't feel right to me to use that money just for rent and groceries. This money feel, well, I dont know, ""sacred""? I feel like I should pick a charity to donate it.I took this week off, but I want to come back to work on Monday. The thing is, I am a teacher. I work with children aged 10-18. I think I should go to work, because without an external obligation, I won't leave my bed. I am afraid that I might not be able to do my job as I should, especially that I can't just burst into tears in front of 4th graders.That being said, can you give me any tips or share your stories? How much time did it take you to go back to work? How did it feel? Were you able to perform well, or at least satisfactory?

As if they are all waiting for me to speak the truth, that indeed I was the reason for my sister's death.I am fighting too much, but if I give up, I go down deep dark waters, if I find courage and take a step forward I feel like I'm doing a mistake, that people will find out the truth that I did a lot of shit which led to the demise of my sister.I can't tell you the pain I continue to carry forward, my mom's disability, dad's lack of care, my disability, and now my sister's demise. A year on and there is no moving forward emotionally.

1c7rs4d;It's been almost 2 months;Explorer-of-Reddit;On February 25th I lost my father(D) to suicide. I miss him so much. I wish I got in touch with him sooner, maybe if I did things would be different. We had a lot of family drama. Short story is that he married my brothers, let's call him C, baby mama. I stopped talking to my dad mostly because of what he did to my brother (C). My dad hated me for taking his side. Assuming. But I found out my brother (C) spent time with our dad for years even though my dad did him wrong. He went hiking and camping with him, while me and our older brother (D2) stopped trying to make contact with him for our brothers(C) sake. C kept it a secret. He,C, also got some of my father's things from his widow (brothers ex) and didn't even bother to give me any of it. But gave D2 some things.  My brother (C) didn't call, he didn't text to see how I was. He didn't even tell me our dad died. I had to hear it from our mom. C acts like he's a victim but he got to spend time with our dad while me and D2 lost our time with him. I miss him every day and I still cry almost every day. I also lost my fiance of 9 years and had a miscarriage. Im so lost I don't know what to do.;On February 25th I lost my father(D) to suicide. I miss him so much.

1c7mngf;Rough day;PackageEmergency5620;I have been really triggered all week, but today has been the worst. I’m not emotional like I was in the beginning, I’m just plain depressed. Today is the 5 month anniversary. I felt like I couldn’t function all day. I’m self employed, and work feels like the hardest thing in the world to do. I sit at my desk and distract myself because writing an email or doing a work task feels like I’m lifting 1000lb weights. I’m in a haze. It sucks because I want to just be normal again, I want to feel normal and be motivated and feel alive. Honestly I think I’d even rather be sobbing and morose and losing it again. This apathy sucks. Is anyone else feeling similar? Or have you been there and come out the other side? I continue to struggle thinking that at 5 months I should be “over it”. But then I remember it’s likely my fault my brother died. (I know everyone will say it isn’t, but it just factually is, unfortunately). Wow, admitting that is kind of a relief. I didn’t kill my brother, but it really was my fault that he died when he did. I feel like I caused this pain, I opened this door to a flood of hurt in my family. I guess I just need to release this into the void.;I have been really triggered all week, but today has been the worst.

1c7kqge;Mute on ME;Batunderbridge;"He was one of my best friends for two decades. I'm one of those people who have very close relationships with all friends, but I have very few friends and all friendships are ""pick up where we left off"" no matter what happens or how long it's been. No questions asked. I would say people tend to tell me their most vulnerable shit easily, but I can be guarded about myself. If you asked a lot of my friends, they would probably say that I was their easiest confidant, yet it feels like pulling teeth to get me to open up. I do it, but reluctantly. There was one person, who for some reason, I did not have such a hard time opening up to. I told him a lot of my secrets I never told anyone else. We also started our relationship as young dumb kids who thought they could do a relationship, tried a few times over the last two decades when we were both single, but after the last couple of years, we just left all that alone. I guess you could say we knew we were chaotic for one another each time we tried to go there.  We never let things get too out of hand and knew each other enough to know when to stop. We are both the kind of people who will withdraw instead of force things that aren't working. We never had hard feelings when things didn't work, we were fluid. It was very unique. At some point, we let that part go. Never touched it again the last 2 or 3 years. I hate saying that a certain person is my best friend because I do love all of my friends so much, but I guess as I write this I realize, if I had to choose, it would be him.  It was about 5 years ago when he first made comments about life sucking, things being hard, and wanting to die. When I realized it was more than dark humor or big venting one day, I drove to a whole other city with one of our good friends that same day and sat outside his house until he let us in. At first, he refused. He did let us in after about an hour. We didn't talk about it. We just hung out and stayed with him. After that day, he made a lot of huge positive changes in his life. That's the kind of friendship we had. l would drop everything to make sure he was OK. I would do what was in my power to wake him up, and I was bringing friends with me. He was there for me over the many years of my mental health blowing things up, I could never forget that. At some point, I moved even further away from him and we could no longer visit easily, but that never changed our connection. We maintained contact like most long-distance friends—lots of memes, reels, random thought texts, recounting stories, and inside jokes to make one another laugh. We talked frequently, not daily, but at least once or twice a week. Occasionally there would be long pauses that happened naturally in conversations. You know, life happens. We never took things personally, we just carried on. It seemed like his life was going well for him. He had a sweet girl in his life, loved his job, and he loved his family. I was happy for him. It was so magical to see him go from that bad day years ago, to that point in time.  One day I sent him a couple of stupid reels. One in particular made me laugh so hard for some reason, and I remember wanting him to open it up so badly. After a week he hadn't opened it. I did think that it was kind of strange he had not at least opened it, but I'm not flipping out on anyone for not opening my dumb-ass reels. After 2 weeks of it unopened. I was slightly put off. I thought maybe he was mad at me but I could not think of why, shrugged it off. After 3 weeks, I did start getting worried I had forgotten something important or I said something dumb without realizing it. I was going to text him to see if he was mad, but then I thought ""Man, I bet I'm just overthinking this, he'll get back to me. If not, I will text him next week to see what is up"" It was nearly week 4 when I was getting ready for work. I 100% said, in my head, ""I'm gonna text him today during lunch, it's been too long"" when my phone rang at that very moment. My friend asked me where I was, what I was doing, and who I was with. Luckily, I was at my boyfriend's house. I was a bit confused about the 20 questions and running late for work. She told me he had hung himself the day before. I got so still and let out a cry that she later told me was the most painful sound she had ever heard. Next thing I know, I am at his house with his closest friends/loved ones and his family.  No one knew it was going to happen. But he had kept in contact with people who lived in town close to him that whole time. Regular hangouts and conversations. Regular texts and responses. But he never opened my last stupid messages to him. It's not so much about him seeing what I sent, but why he would never open my message. I don't understand why he went completely mute and silent on me. It has been bothering me. I constantly wonder, why didn't he talk to me those last weeks. We were so close and for so long, we told each other everything. It even made me question my perspective on our friendship. Did I imagine our closeness? But then I knew that I was important to him because our friends and his family told me how much he loved me, how proud of me he was, and how he always talked about me when we were all at his house. I can't understand it. It has put me in a position of complex/complicated grief I fear. I don't think I will ever know why he went quiet on me, and it hurts so bad. If he had given me a chance, just one conversation, I could have at least told him how much he meant to me. Regardless of the outcome.  I do have a therapist and a psychiatrist, and they suggested doing a support group. I know to not always expect the friendliest responses on Reddit, but I am not sure I am ready for something in person or live online just yet. I am hoping for any responses at all, even from people who did get notes or messages or anything like that. I want to know if it made it any easier or harder, either way.Thanks.";He was one of my best friends for two decades.

She had stopped taking her SSRI medication and she had begun experimenting with large doses of magic mushrooms for a brief time. She stopped them for over a month but she began paranoia. She had been living in Nova Scotia, we got her to come home to Ontario. And on the Friday she arrived and on the Sunday she hung herself in our shower. My son(25) held her body up while my husband and I cut her down. It was horrible. I still see it. Afterwards my husband was really becoming unglued , he has current addiction issues . so I thought it might be good for him to go visit our son in British Columbia who has a family and lives a stable life. He did and he wouldn't come back. He quit his job of 30 years. Our son the 25-year-old who held his sister up has been experiencing mental health issues for 5 years and we have been trying to get him help, and he won't accept help. He ended up going out to British Columbia to live there as well. And I had to move out of my house that we all lived in for 22 years because I could no longer afford it. During the moving process I was so filled with craziness I lifted way too many things and I got a groin hernia and an abdominal wall hernia. And I was unable to work for a quite a while. Right before I had to move my family Chihuahua died. And I had to move into a room at my friend's house and throw out a household of things. Some of those things were memories even.When they told me my issues were too complex it made me only be able to hear that I must be too crazy. Sometimes I feel so alone.;There was a cancellation at a suicide bereavement support group and so today I went for an intake ap;;12;29;2024-04-18 21:43:29;2024-04-18;Thursday;21:43:29;1831;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.506204

1c739ba;does anyone else do this??;Serious_Passenger958;so my girlfriend passed away in february. She was 19. So am i. I’ve made quite a few posts on here, but i’m not sure if they’re all bunched together or not (i’m new to reddit).But ever since she passed i keep getting frustrated at the fact that i know what she would say to certain things if she was still here. I’m not sure if that makes sense? But she was so predictable, and if she was still here and i was to explain what had happened in my life since she left me i almost know exactly what she’d say to every single story.It’s been frustrating me so much because i just want her to be here to hear her say all her usual lines. She also ended her letter to me with “always yours” which i sort of hated. Because it’s just not true is it💔 She was my last thought at night and my first thought in the morning when she was here. I liked that though, it gave me something to think about. She still is my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night. Only now it hurts to think about her.I can’t get over the fact she asked me to be her girlfriend then hung herself four days later?!! she told me she was getting better and her medication had worked. Angelina was the sweetest soul ever. She let me know that she saw me, she didn’t just know me she saw me. Our connection was so pure. On many occasions we would just lie there in the dark for hours just talking about how we were so happy to of met each other. She even said “i could draw every freckle on your face with my eyes shut”.She was my first girlfriend. She saw me like no one else has. And i don’t think anyone else ever will again. I loved her so so much 💔 and she knew that too. I wish i could wake her up for an hour and just tell her how much i would be willing to do to get her back. Maybe she would regret her choice. I miss you so much angelina💔💔 nothing is the same without you.;so my girlfriend passed away in february. She was 19. So am i.

1c72b92;Loss update, now I’m confused about his death;Main_Factor_5228;I posted about my husband who took his life in the beginning of the year. I got his tox screen back and come to find out, the night he died, he had high levels of drugs in his system. Plus drinking. My husband deals with depression. And struggles with addiction. All my therapist and my husbands friends(who have known him longer than me) really believe he did not try to actually die. I know if my spouse was in his right mind(no drugs) he would have never done this. Loving an addict is tough, but he had so much to offer outside his long time battle with addiction. My biggest concern was the fight we had the night he did it. As any addict, they have a ton secrets, which I found out most of the secrets and he was not being honest with me. We distanced ourselves from each other for 2 days and at the end of the second night, we talked the argument. He ended up hanging out with the wrong crowd. One “friend” knew he was thinking about hurting himself. If I had known, I would have stopped the argument and helped him. I didn’t know! He has a past history of addiction and the thought of suicide hits him impulsive. Idk I’m venting.;I posted about my husband who took his life in the beginning of the year.

1c6x801;I witnessed my best friend/room mate commit suicide and have not been able to talk to anyone in detail about it since. ;Ok_Forever3358;Trigger warnings: personal suicide experience / gun violence / deathThe last thing I want to do here is negatively affect someone’s healing process. If you do not feel comfortable reading someone’s story on seeing a suicide please skip past this post. I just needed to put this somewhere and I thought someone out there could relate and maybe feel seen too. I hope everyone here knows that with time and the right support it will become less painful. You will feel like yourself again. Everyone recovers differently and never feel bad for taking more or less time to get back to “normal”. In May of 2023 I woke up and started getting ready for work. My girlfriend was in the shower and I was alone in my room with my dog. The night before my girlfriend and best friend were watching shows together and having a normal night. I worked late and got home after he had gone to bed. He worked from home and that morning he had gotten up at 5AM to get ready for work and do some morning chores. He ran out the trash and did some dishes. At 7AM as I sat in my room starting to get ready for work I heard a loud pop. It jarred me a little bit I thought maybe something hard had dropped on the floor or our doggy gate had fallen over. I opened the door to the living room and when I noticed the dog gate was still standing and the living room was completely empty my heart started to race a bit. I moved to my friends door just across the living room and knocked and heard no response. All I could hear the muffled sound of liquid falling on the carpet in his room but I didn’t hear him talking. The norm would be him on the phone talking to customers and providing excellent service but it was silent. I knocked again and asked if everything was alright. No response. Just the sound of what seemed to be water pouring on the carpet. I started to shake. It took me what felt like a lifetime to open the door which in reality was less than thirty second. I opened the door and saw him hanging half way out of his office chair the side of head facing the floor. The room smelled like gun powder. A pistol laid on the floor about a foot from his opened hand that also hanged off the side of the chair. I won’t go into much more detail than that but I won’t forgot the scene for the rest of my life. The shaking ramped up to my entire body trembling and I walked up behind his chair and shook him. No response. No sound. No movement. I couldn’t see any breathing. I felt trapped and sometimes still feel trapped in that moment. Finally after another 30 seconds my brain kicked on and I ran back to my room and called 911. That moment my girlfriend exited the shower and just kept asking me what’s wrong. I told her to wait in the room. Dispatch asked me to go back and check again if he was breathing. I couldn’t see it. I couldn’t feel air moving in or out but I still had to look again. More time in the room by myself with what used to be my best friend. Dispatch told me the police would be there shortly. I had to then tell my girlfriend what had happened and she fell to the floor and started crying. I grabbed my dog and her and sat outside for hours as the circus of police, emts, and grief councilors did what they do as I broke down on the sidewalk. Now almost a year later I still can’t forget. Life is normal again until it’s not. Until a memory creeps in or something in my life correlates with something that happened that day. The sound of a waterfall, an unannounced pop, a funeral. My girlfriend did not have to see what I saw but was also close friends with him so I don’t feel comfortable sharing any of this with her. My family hasn’t been very supportive or maybe I’m too scared to share this emotional burden with them. I hope if you have been in a similar situation you know that you aren’t alone. I hope you found an outlet or therapy and have begun to heal. I hope you feel secure and safe.;Trigger warnings: personal suicide experience / gun violence / deathThe last thing I want to do here;;14;83;2024-04-18 07:15:42;2024-04-18;Thursday;07:15:42;3902;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.511989
1c6wy4p;My girlfriend ended her life 3 months ago because I wanted to break up. Now I don't know what to do.;happyhippie123;I would like not to go into the details of what happened. Just that my girlfriend ended her life at the beginning of this year because I wanted to break up.Now I don't know what to do or how to feel. The guilt is consuming me. I still breakdown in tears every morning and have crying fits throughout the day. Her family and friends have forgiven me but I just can't forgive myself. I am trying my best to accept what happened, but I feel like I don't want to move on. I know that by not moving on, not is it only bad for me but in our religion, we believe that it is bad for the person who has passed as well. But I just feel guilty if I were to move on. How do I even move on even if I wanted to? I don't want to forget her. I don't want to stop loving her or caring about her.Our 4 years relationship was not toxic or abusive. It had its fair shares of ups and downs but at its core, it was actually filled with love and care for each other. I wholeheartedly believe that it's just one bad miscommunication and us not fully understanding each other that have led to this.I just want to tell her how sorry I am and I wish, every single minute of every single day, that I could go back in time and change things.

1c6wd2n;Brother Died 3 Years Ago and I can’t get over it;Ok_Olive_2533;Hello, my brother died 3 years ago from suicide when I was 17. I am 20 now, and I still struggle. At first I turned to weed to cope with the pain, just constantly being high in order to not think about what happened. I was high 24/7 for probably 2 years after he died. I don’t even remember most of that time. I since quit all drugs and for the past year have been doing way better, as I am making healthier choices in life. Today however, someone asked me what my tattoo meant (I have a tattoo of his birthday)and I nearly burst out crying. This is very unusual for me, normally I struggle to talk about his death immensely but today for some reason I almost broke down. I don’t even like talking to new people because I know eventually I have to tell them what happened to my brother. I am in university and feel like I am missing out on the university experience because of this. I basically have been hiding from the world since he died. What should I do? Most of the time life is great, but I can’t hate how I just start shaking if someone asks me if I have a brother or what happened to him. Part of me probably blames myself. Part of me probably just still can’t believe the brutal way he took his own life. I should probably seek therapy, but I don’t know if that would help me. I just want to be able to talk about his death without breaking down. Thanks for reading this if anyone does.;Hello, my brother died 3 years ago from suicide when I was 17.

1c6q6pg;About my brother, feel free to talk about your loved one in the comments. ;EnvironmentalTerm386;My brother took his life nearly 7 years ago, his death anniversary is next week and following advice on my last post I thought i’d share a bit about him. He loved cars, not long before he died he had just brought his first ever new car he was so happy with it and treated it like his baby, cleaned it all the time and only used the best products on it. He also LOVED playing Xbox/playstation and going to the gym, some of his favourite games were GTA5, assassins creed and call of duty. He was always going on about the gym, he did boxing and was supposed to be doing a proper fight but died just a couple of weeks before the event, he was so excited for it and had been training so much. When I was little some of my favourite memories were of him flexing him biceps and letting me and my younger brother dangle off his arms so he could show off how strong he was. He had a pet hamster named oscar, I never knew of this until I saw his (ex) girlfriend rehoming the hamster on facebook otherwise I would’ve loved to keep him. He was always so caring and gentle towards animals. He would tell the worst jokes. Every time someone farted me + my siblings would argue over who did it, I would always say whoever smelt it dealt it and he would come back with ‘whoever said the rhyme did the crime’. He had short ginger hair and out of 5 kids me and him are the only red heads, he would always call me ginger ninja and mess up my hair by ruffling it. I hated my hair for a long time but recently i’ve started to love it, it’s something I shared with him and i’m grateful for it. I really miss him, I constantly think about what he’d be like now, he would be 33 which is bizarre to think about. He was a child at heart and loved to mess around. I wonder if he’d act old, would he have a receding hairline or look old? I think about where he’d live, what car he’d drive, what kind of a Dad would he be? I want to know why he died, what his last thoughts were, does he regret it, where is he now. If he had just messaged his family he would still be here, he would know how loved he was and how much he would’ve been missed. I wonder if he had just waited one more day would he have gone through with it.;My brother took his life nearly 7 years ago, his death anniversary is next week and following advice;;8;22;2024-04-18 00:41:57;2024-04-18;Thursday;00:41:57;2195;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.517796
1c6ox8b;Today is hard for no reason;Jolly-Steak6263;On days like today, I wish he gave himself just one more day to see if that feeling subsides.I wish he thought of one of our silly jokes and changed his mind.I keep thinking of all the music he will never hear or discover, all the food he will never get to try, all the places he didn’t get to visit before he died.I also think of all the lovely people he won’t get to meet and know, all the emotions, good or bad he won’t get to feel ever again.All the cute pets he won’t get to stroke and play with, all the memes I saved for him that he won’t ever see and laugh at.I keep thinking of all the outfits he won’t try and the ones I never seen him wear.I reflect on all the times he asked me out and I declined because I was lazy, I wish we went out every single time to all the nice places.All the times he asked me to come over for a hug and I said no because I was busy, all the times I didn’t kiss him, all the times I didn’t hold him for long enough.Why do we have to live without them? Grief is hard, knowing he chose to leave is even harder.Did he regret it halfway thought? Did he do it out of spite? Was he peaceful? Was he happy in the end? Did he know all along the end was coming? Was it all a lie? Was the suicidal ideation chronic? How many times a month a week a day?

Did everyone fail him? Did society fail him? Or did his mind fail him?

1c62czq;I miss my mom;Tasty-Mention-1798;My mother took her life a little over a month ago, March 11th, 11 days before her birthday. I was in another state, set to move back home at the beginning of May. I visited on my 21st birthday at the beginning of the year, she seemed happy i was coming back in may, and we were making plans and having fun and she took me to my first casino. I knew she was mentally ill. She was never perfect, when she was bad, it was bad, but when she was good it was great, and I knew she was trying. I hated her when i was younger, but these past years i’ve been trying to be sympathetic and just love her for being my mom, and then she does this and it just feels like a slap in the face. I just want her to come back, i want her to realize it was a mistake and take it back and hold me and give me a kiss and i wanna tell her a joke and hear her laugh again. I want her to be at my wedding, I want her to eventually meet her grandkids, there’s so much more that i need her to see and I need her to be here for and now she’s just gone. I don’t know what to do, i can’t tell if i’m angry or sad or if i don’t care at all it’s just a blur. Time hasn’t been passing properly, I flew back home as soon as I could to be with my father. It’s hard to voice these things to the other people affected. It always feels wrong to have an opinion on the person that no one else shares.

1c626v7;My dad actually did it and we can’t make any sense of it.;Difficult-Spell-2771;On March 27th he sent my sister a message stating that his “end was near.” They had a rocky relationship so she didn’t respond as she felt what he was doing was a bit manipulative. His last correspondences, search histories, and receipts were all on March 30th. He planned a golf trip for April 20th, told some woman on Bumble that he would love to take her mountain biking, went shopping and made himself a nice dinner with wine, steak, mushrooms, the whole nine yards. His search history was innocent, looking up tips for the current games he was playing or random facts he was curious about. He had just placed an order on Amazon for some things he had been working on a while. The only indicator anything was off was his YouTube history. The last video he watched was Linkin Park’s Waiting for the End video which he had watched multiple times over the past month. He was a huge Linkin Park/Chester Bennington fan throughout our childhood. Around 9pm he cut his phone off and it was never turned back on. He hung himself on his pull up bar. The coroner claims it happened between April 2nd-3rd but then what did he do between March 30th-April 1st? He didn’t leave a note, didn’t message anyone goodbye, didn’t even act like this was on his mind. No searches for how tos or anything that would raise a red flag. One minute he existed and then he was just gone. We have no closure. We feel terrible for not taking him seriously. We loved him despite the hardships. That man WAS my dad growing up. He protected me when my own dad wouldn’t and showed me love I never would have had otherwise. He was tormented and lost his battle and I wish I could scream how much I loved him and how much he meant to me. The pain is staggering. The confusion is overwhelming. The lack of closure is enough to drive me crazy. I just needed to vent and yell in to the void for a while because this is a hurt unlike any I’ve ever experienced.

1c5yd2k;Questions, sibling loss, venting;EnvironmentalTerm386;TLDR: brother coerced into suicide, venting, anyone experienced similar? How to cope with sibling loss? Suicide attempts etc.I lost my brother to suicide in 2017. It was completely unexpected his girlfriend coerced him into it (we found messages, cctv and witnesses along with a bunch of other evidence) she sent texts to ensure he put their apartment into her name before he went through with it and did a bunch of shady stuff in general. She refused to give the police any passwords and had managed to delete almost all of their text messages but we were able to recover a few. The police refused to investigate until it was too late and this ultimately meant that she got away with it. I was 11 at the time but my whole life has been extremely traumatic so I was very mature for my age, anyway, it came as a complete shock, I didn’t believe it when I was told and the first thing I did was text him saying hi waiting for a reply, obviously that never came but i’m still struggling to believe it, 7 years later i’m always on the lookout for him, I’m starting to forget his voice and the last few weeks i’ve been thinking about him non stop. It’s like he never even existed, all of his friends have just moved on, nobody seems to care or even remember him, It’s like myself (and my siblings+mum) are the only ones who knew him, it’s like i’ve just imagined his whole existence and he was never actually alive. I saw his body when he died so it’s not like I couldn’t get closure, I also can’t get that image out of my head, I constantly remember how cold and porcelain he looked, every time I remember looking at his lifeless body laying there I can feel the exact way my heart dropped or the way I froze, it was like something took over my body, I literally couldn’t move or speak. I know he’s gone but I still don’t believe it. None of my friends seem to understand what it’s like, I haven’t actually told them but they know through gossip (perks of living on a tiny island) I’m 18 now and I wish I could speak about my brother without it being awkward, none of them met him and it almost makes me feel like I can’t be friends with them because he was such a significant part of my life and they don’t know that version of me, whenever I meet new people they always assume i’m an only child with some fancy happy upbringing and i’m tired of not being able to just speak. I want to tell people about my brother, how funny he was, his love for gaming and his love for cars or these specific new era snapback hats he collected. He was cool and fun, i’m one of the youngest and we had an age gap of 14 years, he parented me sometimes and was the only male influence I had in life, he was the only man that has never abused me too, I just want to say his name, I want people to know I have a big brother, but the trouble is I can’t even say his name out loud let alone explain to people that he’s dead. I’ve never even told someone he’s dead, I physically can’t bring myself to say the words, I just want him back, I always thought he’d be teaching me to drive, playing video games with me or forcing me to go to the gym, I know he would’ve loved lockdown and covid, playing games all day, getting to just be a kid for a couple months, playing outside with family 24/7 not having to work. I find it really hard that he’s missed so much. I also feel selfish ALL the time, my older sisters grew up with him, they were much closer with him so I feel like I shouldn’t be sad, or at least I shouldn’t be using my grief as an excuse to stay in bed for weeks on end, sleeping all day, not showering and failing at school. They still get up and go to work but I can’t even brush my teeth. They have struggled immensely with his death, like a million times worse then me, they had to plan his funeral, tell everyone he was dead and organise everything, they have had it so much worse and yet they’re not completely failing in life. I also think I have PTSD, My sister tried to take her life 2 years ago, it was very serious and a miracle she survived, she’s estranged from the rest of our family so i’m the one that dealt with her attempt, I literally have not been able to sleep for the last 2 years, I distinctly remember being awake at 3am making my christmas list before getting a knock at the door, as soon as i saw it was the police I went white, I couldn’t stand or speak, I was shaking non stop and felt so dizzy, i’m not even sure why because I had no clue what they were about to tell me, I guess I just have trauma surrounded the police, my sister was in the ICU but at least she was alive. Now I live in constant fear of her death, I stay awake all night constantly checking to see if she’s active at unusual times. Just waiting for her to die, waiting to get a call or knock at the door.I feel like she wants to die far more then what my brother did, I believe he was impulsive, hoping someone would care enough to save him, but my sister planned this out meticulously for months, she was raped and abused by various different men throughout her life and has always struggled with mental health (although you would never think it looking at her) she somehow functions normally, has a good job, volunteers, plays sports, exercises all the time and does a lot of charity work, on paper she’s like a perfect role model which makes it even more terrifying because she hides it so well. I get constant flashbacks to the night she attempted, I can’t sleep, I used to be really smart and good at school but i’m literally failing everything, my attendance is awful and teachers don’t understand at all, they all think i’m lazy and choosing not to go in. Every single time I see blue lights or hear sirens it’s like i’m having a mini panic attack, my heart rate triples and I feel physically sick. Every time the word suicide is mentions or anything even close i just go into a panic and i guess i get triggered? Im so tired of always being unhappy or worried. Every second of my day is spent thinking of my dead brother or imagining my sister dying, the thought of them feeling so alone and unwanted breaks my heart. I always wonder what my brothers last thoughts were, I stress about maybe needing to plan my sisters funeral, I just want to feel happy or normal.;TLDR: brother coerced into suicide, venting, anyone experienced similar?

Until i got a call on february 28th and her friend said “hold someone’s hand when i tell you this” my heart honestly shattered and i’ve never felt pain like this. She was texting me the whole day as normal and then done that. She also left me a letter which broke me. She said “in another lifetime we’re everything and more, i just got better at pretending, i brought you into my life knowing better.

1c5v5rt;Suicide by Murder?;GetAwayFrmHerUBitch;I was wondering if anyone else had experience with a complicated situation like this. My partner was murdered two months ago, but his family and I believe he brought it upon himself intentionally. He had struggled with his mental health for a long time and went traveling to find himself/outrun himself. He was going into the worst parts of rough countries, sometimes exploring, sometimes seeking drugs. His last stop before coming home was a city internationally known for a high rate of murder.In one of our last phone calls, I told him, “Whether you do something to yourself, or you take risks that end you, the outcome will be the same for you and for all of us that you left.” A friend told me that he had said to him, “What if something happens to you?” and he had said, “I don’t care.” His best friend confirmed that while in that city, he was going into the scariest places for drugs and even antagonized the (famously corrupt) police. He made himself known to dangerous people. A few days later, was found killed and robbed in his hotel room.Technically, he was a victim. His life was taken from him. However, I can’t help but be furious with him. He was careless with himself, and that means he was careless with my heart.  I don’t even think about his murders. He only used them. I blame him entirely, and then I’m sick with myself for lacking compassion about what happened to him.I don’t even know how I should feel.;I was wondering if anyone else had experience with a complicated situation like this.

1c5p71h;I now understand what people say about the huge waves hitting you at milestones;broken_gl;Had been a bit better. Or so I said to myself. I tried to fireblaze through grief, kept saying to myself that once it’s been a month, once it’s been two months, I will be better. I think it’s because the initial shock hit me so hard, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t even listen to…anything that I kept believing once it’s done, it will get better, I’ll only be left with the sadness. Right? Right….I never imagined that part of the huge wave hitting you before you hit a milestone (two months in my case) is the same anguish you felt when you found out. Denial hits you again, bargaining with the Universe, with your person, trying to bring them back, hits you again. It all feels the same like that day. The tears are equally strong when they eventually come. The constant reminders are back again, hundreds of times a day. And you push forward because there is no other way, no matter how much you’re bargaining, screaming, pleading, crying. How can denial come again? I still can’t go through the good memories. The second I tried, I started crying desperately. It’s such a huge mix of emotions that I really don’t understand how the human brain can cope. And still, pushing forward, keep swimming. Tiredness doesn’t help but sleep isn’t coming easily. Day to day life gets easier, but I feel broken, I feel like nothing will ever get close to the careless me I used to be before. I get up, I do the things I know I’m enjoying, or, at least, the person I was used to enjoy, hoping at some point I will start enjoying them again.;Had been a bit better. Or so I said to myself.

We've talked for sometime and somehow split up, didn't exchange contacts. Didn't had the opportunity to say that I'm here for them if they ever feel lonely. One of the few things I know is that they use Reddit. So, I'm leaving this here if they recognize themselves and feel the need to talk to someone.Sending love;Sorry for this being off topic, would appreciate if it still gets posted.

1c4zxxq;Lost a friend ;Affectionate_Math_37;"Just wanted to honor a friend that I lost over the weekend to suicide.He was a cool dude who was generally liked by the small school I knew him from. I can only assume he had a horrible situation at home, supported by the fact that his grandfather helped fund the attack on the capital on Jan 6.The last day I saw him he was reading the communist manifesto, he always disliked capitalism and argued with our history teacher about that kinda stuff.He had lost his pencil for the fourth time in a row and I joked about him constantly loosing it, to which I gave him another and insisted he keeps it, but he insisted on just borrowing it (hurts in retrospect).He was funny and very opinionated but always commented on me being a ""better version of him in every way"" in engineering class which came naturally to me, but I always just passed it off.I will say we don't know if it was suicide 100% but the principals and teachers refer to it as a death without any other explanation, and with the minimal but still in retrospect evident warning signs I don't see any other way it could have happened.They had therapists at the school today and it was interesting that I didn't see a single guy other that his best friend go to them while almost every girl I'm the school went to see them. Though the reason I didn't was part because I'm  scared of therapy (I don't feel the need as I am generally quite happy and have a strong desire to wake up each day) but also because half my teachers explained a whole new concept and did a bunch of work in class which is awful for the people who sought help, for context the school is like three to four hundred so everyone was effected.I'll probably never know why, but I'm just fucked up right now and this is way to ease that a bit.";Just wanted to honor a friend that I lost over the weekend to suicide.He was a cool dude who was gen;;4;11;2024-04-15 22:41:14;2024-04-15;Monday;22:41:14;1769;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.548582

1c4o93m;Wish me luck!;mamaoftwo530;A year ago, we visited our younger daughter’s new campus, it was overnight trip. I grabbed his work travel bag because it was perfect size. That night at the hotel, I found condoms in the bag. It was the beginning of our sad ending. After that, it was just the series of nightmares. Older daughter left home without telling us, his father died, his work did not go well, his mother got sick. Two and half months later, he took his life. During the last couple of months supported him publicly, but I was so angry and sad because of his betrayal (he admitted it), our private life was a mess. I blamed him so much. I know no point thinking about what ifs. But if I did not grab the bag that day, things would’ve been different? I could fully support his difficult time? On the other hand, I think like he had already cheated on me anyway, our marriage wasn’t perfect anymore, I just didn’t know. Stupid social media showed our campus visit photos today. Good reminder… thank you.  So, for me, the next couple months will be filled with “what ifs”. Please wish me luck so I can survive.;A year ago, we visited our younger daughter’s new campus, it was overnight trip.

1c4hunt;He’s actually gone;OkBalance2833;It’s just been a day of crying. Maybe it’s because me and the baby are sick I don’t know but the waves keep coming now of ‘no this really isn’t a dream, he’s gone, you won’t see him again’ I can’t believe he’s never going to walk through the door, I’ll never see our son get so excited when he walked in or even heard his voice. I’ll never get to see him excited over our son meeting milestones. He was due to start a course for a better job in February, we’ll never see how that turned out. I’ll never see what happened with us, if he did have the intentions of getting clean from the coke. I need to start moving stuff. I’ve got his Christmas presents and Father’s Day presents on the table in the living room. Everything says ‘happy 1st fathers day’ ‘happy first Christmas as a daddy’ because there was meant to be so much more. I need to move his aftershave and toothbrush etc in the bathroom, it’s just like being body slammed every time I see them. The leftover beers from Christmas on the kitchen side, I need to sort his clothes because he’s not coming back. There is no chance of him coming back, he’s ashes and his parents are trying to wipe all records of him existing because ‘suicide is a sin’. What the actual fuck is that about. I’ve got all this full blown rage inside me because this wasn’t meant to happen and I don’t know where to direct it. When I lost my mum I directed it at her illness. If it was a car accident etc I could blame the car.Yes I get he must of been sick to do this but we didn’t know until he was dead, I don’t want to be angry at him. I love him so fucking much it hurts. I’m angry at him for the stuff I’ve found out but I don’t know where to direct this fucking anger that he’s dead. 29, whole life ahead of him.Our son is the image of him, I always used to say they were twins that I copied and pasted him into a baby but he’s growing rapidly and it’s all I see now. There’s a filter on TikTok that turns brown eyes blue and I tried it on the baby and wow, if he had blue eyes they’d be identical. Everyone that sees him commenrs on how tall he is, that’s cause his dad was 6’5 and should still be here. He had so many plans for as he gets older, I’ll do what I can of them but they were best friends it breaks my heart.

My husband took his life (GSWTH) in January while I was home. He texted me to say he was so sorry he couldn’t do this any more. I thought he was talking about our marriage. Seconds later I heard the sound. His phone was still lit up with that text as it laid in a pool of his blood. When I got his phone back 7 weeks later from the police it was still coated in dried blood. In a way I’m glad that that reminder of what happened that night is gone, but at the same time I feel like I’m losing a piece of him. He was glued to his phone 24/7. I sent myself all the pictures he had on his phone and took screenshots of his search history looking up firearms up to 24 days before he completed. In a sense the pictures help give me some sort of closure, that this was his plan and what he clearly wanted to do.;NSFW tag for trigger warning: mention of method and gore Today I did one of the more difficult thing;;15;85;2024-04-15 00:56:05;2024-04-15;Monday;00:56:05;1002;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.558591

At first it was so complicated, so many questions to be answered but 6 months later, as life goes on- people move on and some even forget- now everything can be seen so simply…they left on their own terms…They chose because of various reasons not to go on- and I had to accept the fact that they had the freedom to make that choice but I also have a choice.I have the choice to decide that tragically losing my husband will not be the definition of who I am, my children will live beautiful lives and our story, although containing a few dark chapters, will have colour again and be an amazing book full of lessons, wisdom, grief and growth.My anger has settled, so has my guilt, I’m finally able to look deep into his eyes when I see his photo, I can laugh at our funny moments and the kids and I can share memories openly, and with sincere love and admiration for the man he was.To anyone that still feels the freshness of the pain- know that it will get better and don’t feel guilty when it finally does…We all deserve to live again.;I used to be on this thread daily when it first happened.

1c3tgoj;Incredibly powerful prayer I found;TofuSteaki;"A Prayer for Those Who Have Lost Loved Ones to SuicideMay we be free to grieve in our own ways.  May we take all the time we need to heal the wounds nobody can see.  May we give ourselves the compassion we wish our loved ones could have felt.  May we open our hearts even though it hurts, and recognize that it hurts because it mattered, and that our hearts are big enough to hold it all.  May we allow ourselves the space to process such great pain.  May we learn patience and forgiveness and accept that so many questions will not have answers.  May we never close our own lives to the support we know we need.  May the support systems we build teach us courage and faith, and to honor our loved ones’ lives and everything they were to us.  May the pain we carry grow lighter as we grow stronger.  May we find purpose in the darkness we’ve crawled through, and be brave enough to make meaning out of what we can’t change.  May we choose expression over silence, and solidarity over solitude.  May we create something beautiful out of what happened, whatever kind of beauty we’re drawn to, and may everything we do in love, be done for them.  In their name, may we learn to love all over again, and again, and again.  ""May the radiance and beauty of their lives never be defined by their death.""

1c3lpdd;Lost the only family member I was close with. Feeling resentment and anxious about the future.  Need advice. ;Necessary_Dog_1360;Sorry long text coming in-Hi all, I lost my sibling several months ago. My brother and I were really close and basically talked everyday despite living far apart. I feel like it was an honor to be my brother’s emotional support person because he would tell me everything, and he was struggling for a while before he took his own life. I know it’s not my fault the things that happened to him, but we had an argument and I had not talked to my brother for like a month and a half because I was upset with him. In the week that he passed away, we had made up but I failed to help him when he was most vulnerable because my mental health was suffering that week and honestly I felt disturbed by what happened to him and was trying to think of how to best help him while he was staying over at someone else’s house. My brother was a domestic abuse victim and he stepped out of his apartment to get away and his gf decided to end her life in the hr he stepped out.  Suicide is not caused by one thing but a multitude of reasons and that obviously drove my bro to the edge, especially since there was some build up of negative emotions that I wasn’t there to help him in the 1 1/2 months I wasn’t talking to him.This is also due to the fact that I was the only person in my bros life he confided in. I know I had the privilege of knowing everything that happened to him and he also left a note saying the nicest things to a few people  (including me) before he passed away. I know  manye unfortunately don’t get closure with knowing the reasons “why” However, I still have a lot of unresolved feelings like feeling super anxious about the future because I don’t have a great relationship with my parents, I don’t have any extended family like Aunts and am on the aromantic spectrum.  I feel like I have explored some new hobbies that helped, but I feel dread thinking about the future and that there won’t likely be a person that’s gonna be in the majority of my life like my bro. This is kinda selfish of me to say, but I feel like I’ll never have a strong as relationship with anyone like my bro, especially since friendships come and go, and society as a whole prioritizes romantic relationships. I know there are some great parents who unfortunately lost their children in this sub <3. However, im also struggling with resentment towards my parents because my bro and I  never had a  good relationship where we could go for them for help without getting yelled at or being taken seriously.

They were VERY small, minor things and absolutely nothing that I would have ever broken up with him over or anything like that but it definitely made me question his honesty in our relationship for the first time ever. And of course now he’s not here for me to talk to about it & it’s been putting me in a weird headspace all day.

1c2gy40;Day 52: Celebration of Life Tomorrow ;Curious-Fortune6061;It’s been 52 days since my partner left. It had been a long struggle. Even asking him parents and friends for help, daily outreach and multiple attempts at inpatient, we lost the battle. His parents and family blamed me directly and over social media. The sister said she would have me escorted out by police if I attended the service. They came to my home and took anything or monetary value. I then planned my own service where we lived, which is far from his family and his hometown. My friend started to go fund me to help pay for the memorial which the family reported as fraudulent and outwardly posted on Facebook that I was taking advantage of his death for monetary gain.I have gone no contact with him and it has been much easier to grieve my partner after ceasing communication with his family. It’s been a long time coming lots of planning, but the service is finally happening tomorrow. There are tons of people coming into town and I am used to being a hermit and rotting on the couch with our dog .It’s so scary to have people coming into town and the service actually happening it makes him feel actually gone. I don’t want it to feel like he’s actually gone, but I just wanna honor him in anyway I can. I miss him so much, but I’m also angry with him.

1c1y0uc;Why do I not cry over my brother?;veganarchist_;My older brother committed suicide almost 5 years ago, and I feel guilty that I don’t seem to miss him very much. He died when we were both teenagers, and except for the obvious crying when it happened I don’t cry all that much from thinking about it despite it popping in my mind unwelcomed nearly every minute. At first I assumed it was shock or denial, but going on 5 years seems like a long time for that. We were relatively close when we were little, him having me watch him play computer games because he wouldn’t let me play. He always had severe anxiety and became reclusive in his teenage years. He probably only spoke a handful of words to me in the months leading up to his death despite us living in the same house. He was always mean and bitter towards me so I just assumed he didn’t want to be around me. Sorry, I’m getting off track. I just don’t know what it is that makes me not feel anything other than anxiety when thinking about it. I have diagnosed PTSD from it, have struggled a lot since, but I just can’t seem to cry about it or feel anything but strange. Triggers like numbers in the date it happened, things relating to the method, sibling related things and the sort all make me think about it, some make me have little dissociative episodes where I feel like I can’t speak and my eyes go really wide? But I’ve almost never cried just from thinking about it. I think a lot of it is because of how polar opposite my mom’s grief is: completely consuming and gut wrenching. She has screaming panic attacks and sometimes thinks she’s having a heart attack because of it. Can’t talk about him without weeping. Wants to commit suicide some days. Can’t get out of bed other days. I’ve always felt like I had to help her through it or just tolerate the crying. It used to make me mad for some reason, like when it first happened her crying would anger me because I guess I felt like I had to be the strong one and I wanted it to be over with? Like of course her grief is going to be stronger than mine, but hers being so bad makes me feel even more like I have none. It’s just awkward when she’s crying about it because despite my sympathy and how horrific it is to see your own mother in so much pain I just can’t seem to cry. I’m not sure what it is. I just feel guilty because I cried with more mourning over my pet lizard’s death than my brother’s. I feel like something’s wrong with me.;My older brother committed suicide almost 5 years ago, and I feel guilty that I don’t seem to miss h;;6;17;2024-04-12 02:37:44;2024-04-12;Friday;02:37:44;2410;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.590323

1c1ce2s;Suicide jokes (unbearable awkwardness) ;unknownemotion231;Just wondering if anyone else feels like this: So basically a lot of people around me both at work and in my personal life know I lost a parent to suicide. Only a handful actually know how, but it's quite common knowledge it was suicide. I've noticed in my age group and at work a lot of people have what is considered 'dark humour'. And I get that, because I'm similar. But whenever someone around me slips up and makes a joke about suicide, I feel the whole room go silent and it always feel like everyone starts watching me. I never know how to react! Because it always catches me off guard and makes me so uncomfortable. It's happened a few times at work and with friends now. I almost feel like I somehow how to react to alert everyone I'm fine, but also I don't want to do that because actually I would prefer it if its wasn't used a jokeline. I do feel bad for them because when they realise what they've said they always seem to stutter or look really embarrassed.;Just wondering if anyone else feels like this: So basically a lot of people around me both at work a;;20;50;2024-04-11 11:11:15;2024-04-11;Thursday;11:11:15;972;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:05.600002
1c1av45;Survivors guilt due to my brothers suicide ;yeetedbacon;My (f23) brother (m14) committed suicide 5 months ago. I am a shell of who I was before he died, I barely recognise myself. Throughout my life I have dealt with mental health issues, I was diagnosed with autism when I was only 5 years old. Then when I was a teenager I dealt with depression and anxiety. In my teenage years I never applied myself at school because I was actively not wanting to be alive. Long story short I was a troubled teen who didn’t think I would live till now. Last year I decided I wanted to actually live a life. I went into therapy where I was told I had bpd and I was working on myself. Planning a future and thinking about going back to study. I was also still doing this while in the grief process of my grandmother who died the previous year. Anyways in October my 14 year old brother without warning or any signs pointing to him doing this..he committed suicide. I knew he was struggling with school, he was a teenager and went to a very prestigious school where excellence was expected. He was stressed and I did my best as a sister to help him. I told him to speak with his school guidance councillor (which he did) in hopes his school could help him. He didn’t let on that anything else was going on so I didn’t inform my parents as I thought it was under control but I told my brother that I would tell our parents if I thought it was getting a bit too much. He left a note for me and our parents. He was dealing with so much more than he let on, things that I went through as a teenager as well. Things like sexual orientation issues, gender issues and pressure from adults. I should’ve seen the signs. Why did he do it. He had the most bright and amazing future, he was one of those kids that you looked at and knew he was going places. People didn’t see that when they looked at me. I was the child who was only just scrapping by. I dont know why but I feel guilty. Like it should have been me instead of him. Like maybe I would have hurt less if it was me. Maybe my parents wouldn’t be so sad if it was me instead of him. I need to be clear when I say I don’t plan on taking my life and have no plan in the future to. But the thought won’t leave my head.;My (f23) brother (m14) committed suicide 5 months ago.

I failed him. ;maevetrees;My dearest uncle took his life on Saturday after losing his wife from cancer one month ago.He told everyone he was going to do it. He was admitted to the mental health unit. I knew they’d discharge him too early. I had no say in his care because I’m the youngest and ‘couldn’t possibly understand how to help’ him despite much personal experience with the mental healthcare system.He hanged himself in the garage after his other brother decided it’d be smart to drive to the shops to grab milk. Who does that? How didn’t they understand what suicide watch meant? He was left all alone with so many options to do it. He keeps telling us it’s time to celebrate his life — but this is an absolute tragedy. My imagination won’t leave me. Him hanging there. Crying, running to the garage to make it happen. Feeling so cold and alone. Passing away alone. The pain. The agony.I’ll never forgive myself for not banging down doors to advocate for him. My life will never be the same. I see nothing but darkness. They say they don’t want to die, but be out of pain. Was he crying as he did it? Did he not feel our love anymore? Why didn’t I do anything?

1c17qe4;Dreaming of my dad every night ;littleloved_;Most of the time, I do my best to not think about my dad at all because what’s the point? I get so depressed and I don’t want to get stuck in it. As well as I can’t afford the privilege to, there’s too many responsibilities to take care. But lately I keep dreaming about him. It’s starting to become a cycle where every morning when I wake up I realize he is not here and I can’t make the dream a reality. It crushes my heart because I feel like I’m being taunted but happy as well because I get to see his face and hear his voice. One of the first dreams I had of him was I was at my dads house and he was standing in front of me. I felt confused because I knew he was dead but he was “living” right in front of me. I asked him to come back, he said how long has it been? I don’t  remember if I said anything after but the last thing he said to me was “Is it too late to come back?” I remember the regretful expression on his face and then the dream ended. It felt so real like it did actually happen. So it’s been very frustrating to not let these dreams affect me so much. That dream alone has made me feel so much sadness in ways I can’t describe. I miss my dad so much. His funeral is this Saturday and i’m really scared to go. Everything is starting to set in and I don’t want this to be a reality. So I guess this is just a rant to get some feelings out. Or If anyone has or is dealing with something similar, how to do you cope with it?

Nan is creating stories in her mind how sister lifted something heavy that made her die later on that day. To top it off, family is waiting for the autopsy results, they keep asking daily if they arrived. Some of the questions are aimed at me. It feels like mum is oblivious that people already know. My auntie knows as I called her in shock once sisters friends revealed what went on that day. So sisters friends know too. But I have been forbidden from talking about it.

1c0npkc;How do I feel ok at all ;poltergeist_friend_;Hi, my younger brother ended his life on 4/4/24, one month to the day before his 24th birthday. Me and my fiance drove to his house to check on him on 4/5/24 when his boss called my parents to say he didn’t come to work. I saw him first, only a quick glimpse before I ran out to call 911. 911 asked us to go see if there was anything we could do for him. I couldn’t go in but my fiance did, confirmed there was nothing, and took my brother down (hanging). then came out and we just held each other crying until EMS and everything arrived. It’s too long to tell you all the whole tale but my brother had a long manic episode in 2023 and was very resistant to care. We even had to do a 1013 on him and get the cops to take him to a mental hospital at one point. But at a second hospitalization in Jan 2024 he was diagnosed with bipolar and got on meds that seemed to really help. He was doing a lot better all of 2024 and got a good job and moved in with my older sister and her husband in early March. He ended his life in their house. Nobody is angry at him. We had times through 2023 where we knew he was attempting or we had no idea where he was, so I had already steeled myself for this possibility. But actually seeing him was a terrible horrible shock. Like I got shot by a shotgun. He timed an emailed note that delivered when my whole family was together and my dad read it to us out loud. If answered a lot of questions and my brother emphasized he just had to escape and couldn’t stay because the episode and meds changed him into someone so different. I also have bipolar disorder, albeit I don’t think as severe as him. I had to try a lot of med combos to find what worked it took like 1.5 years until I had meds I liked. I told him to report every side effect, feeling he didn’t like to his psych so they could adjust and try new stuff. He was so so so early in treating that condition when he gave up. But I know every day was hell and I’m grateful for the time in 2024 he spent doing better and he intentionally spent A LOT of time with our family to I think leave us with positive memories after 2023 was a wild and crazy and hard year. I’ll miss him forever but how am I already telling the story of his suicide and not crying? And I have moments of joy lately? It’s fucked up. My brother wasn’t a druggie no crime no money problems (sorry don’t want to upset anyone I’m just saying it makes it harder to understand for me). He had the brightest future and was the brightest light. I don’t even know why I’m thinking it but he had so much stupid money when he passed. He gave us all his passwords to everything all financial accounts and even his phone. Maybe I’m not in constant pain and tears rn because he planned so well that no one could stop him but also so that we had as much closure as possible. Or maybe my brain is out of sadness. This is my first loss in my life tbh, all my grandparents are still alive. Just really struggling that I can function. Also I have three younger siblings. Two 8 year olds and one 12 year old. My brother was absolutely their best friend and he did sooooo much with them. I’d be off traveling or with friends, my brother was with them every weekend.

I had a good day but that night I felt so off. How could I possibly be 20 years old now without my mom. Without the person who literally put me here. I feel so off about it all. Its so weird celebrating without her, when she was the only one to really celebrate with me before. Especially because Im also feeling so many emotions yet none at all about the anniversary in 2 days. I wasnt having this feeling around Christmas. My dad did a really good job with making my birthday and other holidays feel special but i just cant shake the weirdness of it all. I dont know why my birthday specifically is bothering me so much. Maybe its because its now tied with such an awful event and its so difficuly to unscramble them. If you have advice or can relate let me know! Thanks for listening yall. 🧡;Hey all.

1c0co7g;I don't know how to move on.;Sloth859;I'm in this strange purgatory where I don't know what to do, or how to move on. An ex-girlfriend of mine died by suicide a couple years ago. I want to talk with someone closer to her, but I don't actually know anyone personally (we didn't have any mutual friends). I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to speak to me about her.I'm sorry for the incoming wall of text, but I feel the context is important to explain where I'm at now.I met this girl in college and I gave her my virginity and she gave me hers. I didn't realize it until it was too late, but she had had a huge crush on me for quite a while. I deeply cared for her, but I didn't feel like we were ultimately right for each other. So, I broke it off. I knew I had hurt her, but I thought I was ultimately doing what's best.We drifted apart, and reconnected years later through Facebook. I was relieved to see how great her life was going. She was married to a very successful guy, and they had a kid together. Here I was trying to make ends meet to take care of my family, and she was going on extravagant vacations every other month with her family. It seemed like she was living the dream, and I was truly happy for her.About 3 years ago something changed. Her Facebook posts got a lot more serious all of a sudden. I could tell something was wrong, but I didn't have the courage to ask about it, or say anything supportive. It didn't feel like my place. Then she stopped posting altogether.Later, someone posted on her page that she had died by suicide, and others posted pictures from the funeral. There weren't any details about her motivation, other than what seemed like textbook depression, but I suspect there was more to it than that.I was initially struck with overwhelming grief like nothing I've experienced before. I spent two weeks crying... like intense crying. I would go to work and hide in my office trying (unsuccessfully) to get control of myself pretty much all day. I settled down, and about six months later, I had another wave of grief. In addition to sadness, I felt shame and guilt. She didn't kill herself because I broke up with her, but I felt like I had somehow put her on that dark path, and I was ultimately responsible in a butterfly effect sort of way. Another six months later, and I was hit by another round. This time, I felt a different type of shame, like I had no right to grieve for her that much. We hadn't spoken in 20 years, and I had had plenty of chances to reach out to her to tell her how sorry I was.Now, at this point, I feel like I've settled, but I don't feel good. I still think about her every day, but I'm not crying anymore. I feel like I've stopped sinking, but now I'm stuck at the bottom.  More than anything I just feel isolated and lonely.;I'm in this strange purgatory where I don't know what to do, or how to move on.

My mom and I confirmed our assistance and also organized a smaller party for my sister the next day with her close friends and some family members, which I feel very comfortable to see and celebrate my sister with. As the days passed I realized I don’t really want to attend this big party and talk to strangers about my sister and this month I’ve been feeling really sad and angry and don’t feel like spending time with people so I told my mom I didn’t want to go and she told me that she would be extremely mad and disappointed with me if I didn’t go and that I had to attend to support her because she has always supported me and that I am being selfish and can’t believe I would do this to her. I don’t know what to do. I really want to be there for my mom but we are both dealing with our grief in a different way, she is more social and likes to talk about my sister with everyone and I can’t talk about her right now and struggle in social settings. My mom has been there for me every second of this process and I’m so grateful to have her support. I just want to crawl in my bed and cry on her birthday. What should I do? Please, I don’t want to be selfish and make my mom feel like she doesn’t have someone to support her but I also feel very depressed and don’t want to go push on my emotional capacity and be more distressed than I already am.;My sister died by suicide 6 months ago and her 24th birthday is coming up next week.

1c0bs9p;My youngest brother ended his struggle with mental illness;mjsoctober;He had been away from us for 2 years during which he went down some dark Internet holes. Recently he came home. He was suffering psychoses and we took him to the hospital. He got some treatment and they have him medication but he didn't want to take it. He was really getting better, but then he asked to be taken back to his apartment and two days later he was dead. Now I am in anguish. I am so mad that I couldn't stop him. That he was so close to being home with his family again but he chose this instead. I can't compute what's happening.

1c095yf;I Found a Bag in the Basement;allthetinysquiggles;"One of those reusable woven grocery bags. Covered in dried blood. Your blood.The hazmat guys did a great job with the basement, they really did. And they were so damn kind too. Held my hand and walked me downstairs when they were done, to show me the horror show was gone. It looked like it had never happened. But the basement was a mess before you died and it remained a mess afterwards. I've finally drummed up enough courage and drive to start tackling it. And by tackling it, I just mean throwing all of your shit into contractor bags, and hauling them to the dump. This is me losing my temper and finally giving in to the rage first, an exercise in cleaning and organization second.I guess I knew in the back of my head that there was a chance I could find something like this. There was so much junk down there, and you went out of your way to make this as messy a suicide as you could. I know you did that on purpose and I absolutely fucking hate you for that dad. Even though I knew it could happen, I truly just....wasn't expecting it. I'd gotten a few bags filled already, had some music playing, was in the groove. Hauled another bag up the stairs, turned to go back down, and saw the lime green grocery bag on the steps; must have fallen out. Went to pick it up and noticed it felt stiff on the bottom. So I turned it over to look at it.I don't have the words to describe those feelings. I just don't. Dark reddish brown spattered all over the bottom of the bright green bag. Its been three days and I still don't have the words.You didn't die alone. I was with you when you died. Mom was with you when you died. We watched you bleed out on the basement floor. I know this happened. I saw it and I heard it. I smelled it. I know it happened. So I don't know why finding that bag and looking at it shocked me so badly.It's probably very fucked up and very abnormal, but it took me hours to throw away. It sat there on the table all morning, and every now and then I'd take a break from cleaning and walk over to it and just stare at it. I seriously contemplated not throwing it away at all.  I even took a couple pictures of it for...I still don't know why. Maybe because things didn't feel quite real? I dunno. I hope one day I can delete them, even though the idea of deleting them feels like you dying all over again which makes no sense. I did finally manage to put it in its own trash bag and take it to the dump. That felt like you dying again too. Mom was going to swing by soon, which I guess is a good thing because it snapped me out of whatever the hell kind of episode that was. I didn't want her to see it. It's one thing for me to go through dealing with this, but I absolutely fucking refuse to allow you to revictimize her and sibling. Better me than them, always.But that's also what gets me the most. You're dead! You hated yourself, and you hated your family, and goddamn it's breathtaking how much you hated me, and so you put a rifle under your chin and now you're gone. You've been gone for two and a half years. How then. HOW? FUCKING TELL ME HOW YOU'RE STILL TORTURING ME!All I've ever wanted was some peace and safety, and you keep denying me that, even though you're gone.When the hazmat guys were done cleaning up your horror show, it looked like it had never happened. I will eventually get all of the rest of your stuff out of the house, blood spattered and all, and it will look like you never happened. I just wish it looked and felt like that in my head too. The horror show is still very much present in there. It always will be.";One of those reusable woven grocery bags. Covered in dried blood.

1c01ftu;What have you done to feel like you belong again?;sotnaaS;"It sounds like a very broad question, I know. In my case, it's been four months since I lost my girlfriend and I've been having trouble dealing with the whole ""feeling like a ghost"" ordeal. I've always found solace in art, especially music, and in time spent with my close friends, but lately, although it's not always the case, it's really difficult for me to actually connect with what's happening. Like I'm not a part of my life, or that it's not even there anymore and I'm really just passing by everything that happens around me and to me.Despite my somewhat somber phrasing, I find myself to be a little lucky to be able to recognize some brief (and rare) moments of belonging. Usually during a good conversation, sometimes about my late girlfriend, or during a rehearsal with my band where I really manage to pour my emotions out through the music. Anyways, I'm not really looking for suggestions, I'm more interested in what this community has done lately to feel like they belong after such cruel circumstances.

1bzw4eg;It gets easier;Tracie10000;I want to tell all of you something.  Life after losing a loved one to Suicide is so very hard.  I lost my dad to suicide. Today is the anniversary.  I live with guilt.  We were estranged because he let me down so many times as a kid. I told him that until he could actually be my dad , I didn't want contact.  A few years later he was gone. After I cut contact he really got his life together,  became a paramedic worked at that for years. But I was too much of a coward to reach out. Too afraid of rejection.  For years I was consumed with guilt. Within weeks of dad dying,  i lost my 2 best friends who said  they could no longer be friends because of dad. Then I lost an aunt an uncle a friend to various causes. Then I was hit by a distracted driver and left disabled.  Lost my career,  my hobbies.Then I lost my nan the beating heart of my family.  Then my sister died by choking in her sleep after misuse of prescription drugs. I was diagnosed with depression anxiety and PTSD.  Life was dark, so dark. Scraping money to live. Then life changed. Time healed. I learnt to meditate. I learnt to deal with the constant physical pain from the accident.  Learnt to accept dad died. Talk about him. Love him so proud of him.  He is so much more than his cause of death. I moved away from my home town.  Freed up money,  started university via distance learning as some days the pain is too much. Came off all antidepressants. What I'm trying to say is no matter how dark things seem,  they do get better,  there is light at the end of the tunnel.  You will never forget those you have lost, that loss will always be with you.  But there is hope for the future.  Plan things to look forward to,  little things to focus on, do something to honour the memory of your loved one. I'm looking into  volunteering at a suicide prevention charity,  I'm finally in a place mentally where I can offer help and support.  I'm looking into what exercise I can do,  I need crutches but want to lose a bit of weight,  get fit. Every little thing I plan was impossible even a year ago. Until I realised that planning and starting these things is helping me progress along the path of healing.  I'm so sorry you are here. So sorry for your loss.  But you aren't alone. We are here for each other.  I'm here for you.  Sending love to you all.  I promise it will get easier.;I want to tell all of you something.

She was an addict and the type of person who called constantly and tried to drag me into her crises.She completed suicide last month after multiple attempts in the last two years.

I would never have chosen for this to happen, but I feel some relief that she can no longer hurt me.Sometimes, as I'm walking around, I sense a profound silence. I know a lot of people believe in an afterlife, but I don't. My mom's absence is almost palpable. It's like I can hear the silence.The silence makes me feel lonely.

1bze5ay;Overcoming my brother’s suicide ;Read-Alert;I have never posted on Reddit so please bear with me here. I’m currently a 22 year old male figuring out my post-grad life, but I’ve come a long way in my journey and wanted to open up a discussion for anyone who has gone through even remotely the same thing.My older brother took his life in 2017 at the young age of 19. I was a naive 16 year old at the time and to say that my world was flipped upside down and that my childhood was violently ripped from my grasp is an understatement to say the least, but almost 7 years later I confidently say this (this quote is not mine, however I don’t remember who originally came up with it): eventually grief feels less like it is strangling you and more like it is giving you a soft hug.Although I had premonitions about my brothers suicide, I naively believed that if I were to speak or act on the matter, it would then make it a possible reality. If you have ANY feeling that anyone you love may harm themselves, let my story be a lesson to you. In the weeks leading up to his suicide in the summer of 2017, his entire demeanor changed. He had struggled with MDD and GAD since he was a child, but all of the sudden he was at total peace with himself. He was fully atheist for all of his life until he picked up a Bible and read it in three days. He would have friends over one by one and on two occasions I heard them sharing their favorite memories. In our final conversation he asked me if I was afraid to die. I choked on my words saying I never thought about it because we had so much time left, and he proceeded to tell me that he hopes it’s just like falling asleep. All of the red flags you can imagine, but if I didn’t say anything it wouldn’t happen. You can imagine how it felt when I found his body with a handgun in his lap that night. The following year, all I wanted was to see the world burn to ashes. I wanted everyone on earth to suffer, to understand what it’s like to have your heart ripped out.  I was incredibly naive, and soon I felt very few emotions other than pure self resentment. That resentment bled into all aspects of my life, and I began to hate the way I looked and presented myself. Now, it takes a lot to make me cry, but I always move to tears when I think about that poor 16 year old kid who just couldn’t understand why he was so full of fear and rage, so much so that he hated himself for it. Things changed after a few years. Firstly I went to college and changed my environment. This was a large component in moving forward with the grief process: a new atmosphere, new people, a new stage of life. Secondly, I changed many of my habits. I ate more frequent, healthier meals, I worked out 4-5 times a week, picked up nightly “meditation” (mostly breathing practices to become more mindful of the world around me), and I started journaling. This is not to say that I didn’t miss my brother every waking second, or occasionally break into tears for him. I still had random anxiety attacks or saw his body in my dreams. Some days felt unbearable, and others would be better. One or two years pass and I’m halfway through college on a camping trip with my friends. We were in Telluride, Colorado, watching the sun set over the Rockies. I remember after a bit of bliss silence my friend said to me something along the lines of “I’m sure your brother is damn proud of how far you’ve come.” Unsurprisingly the suddenness of his words reduced me to a crying mess, but it wasn’t because I missed my brother, or because I should have sucker punched him with all of my strength when I knew our final conversation was happening, or because I remembered how dark the blood that soaked his shirt was. It was because my friend was right. Here I was, watching this sunset and so absorbed by the beauty in the world around me that all words would fail, even after going through what I would have imagined would kill me. He would be proud. He’d be damn proud. To anyone who took the time to read this, thank you. You will survive.  Please remember “the light you seek is within you”, you are never alone, and through your darkest times fight to hold on to your humanity, for you are the strongest person you will ever know. And to my beautiful big brother, your baby brother misses you.;I have never posted on Reddit so please bear with me here.

I remember always taking my profits and giving them to my parents - they would never ask me but I would do it because I knew we needed to pay the power bill or needed groceries.My parents eventually got divorced when I was 15-16 and I lived with my dad. My dad became incredibly bitter and narcissistic, he started drinking and it took over his life. He followed me throughout my time in college and jobs I had - I really took on the roll of the parent early in my life.I was 25-26 years old and my dad was still living with me. He would drink from the minute he would wake up and until he would go to bed. It was an incredibly depressing household - I was paying the rent, food and all the bills and even paying for his alcohol which is just so wrong. After awhile we started ton resent eachother and we decided it was for the best that he left - I tried as much as I could to help him with his addiction unfortunately it became just too big for me to handle. trigger warning  My dad commited suicide at a time when we wernt getting along. I remember when it happened and getting that phone call from my sister. What's weird is we weren't talking when he died so his death didn't hit me until much later, when he died I kept myself busy and just handled everything from his debts, funeral arrangements etc...About 6-7 months later his death hit me like a freight train. I immediately put a pause on my career and went to seek help to talk it through. As helpful and refreshing therapy is, the whole suicide thing has left me in such a strange place. I no longer have the drive for anything, especially in my career - I no longer have tbat drive to progress and work towards a promotion. I honestly have such a hard time finding myself - sometimes I look in the mirror and just stare at myself wondering where the best version of myself is?? When I'm working I have this massive urge to just yell on top of a mountain top and let people know that I wasnt always like this - I'd love for them to know that the version of me they are seeing isn't what I once was.It's been 3 years since his death and I'm only realizing now that when he left, he took a part of me with him and im struggling to get little parts of my old life back. Maybe someday ill be able to feel like I use to? One can only hope...Btw - I'm not suicidal, just venting. If youve made it this far thanks for reading.

1bxypch;lost a sweetheart a few days ago;Room0814;He ended his life. We were so close as kids, then we drifted apart. We both grew up in abusive households, but I thought he was stronger than me and managed it well. He taught me how to protect myself from my abusive caregivers when we were still kids. He would bring me mini chocolates and sour candies when he came over to my house weekly They are still my ‘comfort’ food, if I go to a convenience store and they are selling those, I will get some. It makes me feel better  Growing up, I became quite a problematic kid, rebellious, breaking rules, and all those things, while he was the model kid everybody adored. Smart, academically gifted, and a good character, needless to say. We didn’t cross paths much during these phases, but every time I think of him or occasionally see him around riding his bike, it warms my heart even without direct interactionHe managed it well and functioned normally in his adulthood, or so it seems… Me, on the other hand, not so good. The darkness stays with me. I m diagnosed with depression and some mental illness and they r my constant demons to fight with We got back in touch last year, and he got his life together, and I’m so proud of him. He was in a relationship, so I thought maybe I should keep my distance to avoid misunderstandings and whatnot. Our friendship is purely platonic, but he was quite a romantic person. He would buy me the same chocolates on Valentine’s Day and drive hours to bring me to a beach to make me feel better when I’m sad. I’m not an easy person to be around, but I think I’m my best, genuine, healthy self when I’m with himI'm getting in touch with my therapist soon. I missed my meds for quite a while now and woke up from nightmares at night in fight mode. I'm not in the best place mentally, but I've started feeling like I’m back in control. I miss him. It hurts so bad to know that he's never going to come back, and that I'm never going to see this sweetheart again You're still the strongest and sweetest person I’ve met, I’m so glad you existed.

1bxm0g6;What was going on in his head;OkBalance2833;I’ve just been angry the past few weeks that he left us. Sounds selfish I know but the main thing I could think is how the fuck have you left us?Then it hit me today, what must of been going through his head. To think his friends, his family even if I don’t think much of them with how they’ve been in this situation, me, his son was better off without him.I keep reading texts, there was so many plans. He was so excited for him to crawl, he’s been crawling ages now. Couldn’t wait for him to walk, he’s nearly walking. Couldn’t wait to buy him his first boxing gloves and take him boxing, take him to football. I get so sick on rollercoasters and he loves speed, adrenaline so he said that’s all him. We should be buying stuff for holiday for our sons 1st birthday in 2 weeks, I’ve saved the hotel we were going to go too. I’ll bring him one day, to the holiday his daddy chose. I can’t believe there’s a chance he thought we would all be better off without him. That he was in that much pain this was the only option. I am 100% certain this was a impulsive thought gone through on but how long had he been depressed for? I can’t believe someone would have their first suicidal thought and go through with it. Especially when they had the bond with our son he did. I’ve videos of them dancing together at Christmas, videos of him smiling and messing around in December. We constantly talked about our sons future. I can’t imagine how much pain he was in to do this, how long it was going on and he didn’t speak to anyone. None of us knew he was even depressed. We knew he struggled with addiction but we’d spoke in depth 9 days before he did it about getting help and he genuinely seemed to be looking for help this time. He occasionally said he was down but we spoke and it was normally work related, sleep loss related, something small but we’d talk and he’d be fine. Other times I’d just say get back home and once he was here he was fine? Or he seemed it? It actually hurts to think how much he must’ve been hurting and how alone he must’ve feltThe only time now I look back and think hmm is a selfie he sent me 2 days before. The spark is gone in his eyes, I don’t know how I didn’t notice that at the time. I met up with a friend of his earlier with our kids and she couldn’t believe how much our son looks like him. If he stays where he is on the growth chart now he’ll be taller than his dad and he was 6’5. I’m 5’1 lol our sons half the size of me already I’ve wrote down every plan he had for us and our son. I’ll make sure it gets done but fuck me I wish he was here for it. I wish he didn’t think this was the only way out. I wish at least one person knew what was going on with him inside his head. This world wasn’t better off without you at all, you were genuinely one of a kind.;I’ve just been angry the past few weeks that he left us.

1bx3dbd;Help- will I see the light at the end of the tunnel? Partner loss.;sunflower-00;Losing my partner to depression 8 weeks ago, and being the one to find him, has been incredibly difficult. Some days I manage okay, but most days are a struggle. This journey feels incredibly lonely and empty. Despite the support from family and friends, I still feel a sense of loneliness because it's hard for them to truly grasp the pain I'm experiencing.Over these past 8 weeks, I've been constantly dealing with my emotions. I've been reading articles and watching videos in an attempt to understand depression better. I want to comprehend what my partner went through and what led him down this path. He was truly an amazing and kind person, with a good career, a close-knit support system, and a loving relationship. It's been challenging for me to grasp the depth of his pain, especially since he seemed to have everything going for him.I understand that depression is a mental battle, often leaving individuals feeling hopeless and worthless despite external circumstances.I wonder if I'll ever find my way out of this darkness. It feels like I'm trapped in an endless pit with no light at the end. Memories of him keep flooding back, bringing tears to my eyes. I mourn the loss of what could have been, especially with him. Despite seeking grief counseling, I haven't found much solace in it.My heart still aches terribly whenever I think of him. I constantly question if there was anything I could have done to help or save him. I'm consumed by self-blame, guilt, and anger towards myself.I'd appreciate hearing how others have navigated through this healing journey.;Losing my partner to depression 8 weeks ago, and being the one to find him, has been incredibly diff;;9;12;2024-04-06 05:05:49;2024-04-06;Saturday;05:05:49;1578;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:07.080405

A lifetime if you will. 11 years since the worst day of my life. 11 years since my brain was altered forever. I want to be able to say it gets easier, but that wouldn't be honest. Time just kinda moves. The world just keeps spinning. 11 years ago this month my already difficult life was changed for the worst, completely unexpectedly & completely out of my control. I used to say I was scared that I'd never be the same but of course I won't, who would be? I still see you. I see you as you were in life and I see you as you were in death. I hear you. I hear your laugh, your famous quotes and I hear that ungodly sound ill never forget. I hear sirens and words I can't forget. I'm grateful for the magical moments I've felt in the past 11 years. I'm loved and I'm safe and I'm happy in so many ways. I appreciate so much more than I ever could back then. I'm older now. I'm grateful. I fight daily for peace and I cling to every bit I feel. But you'll forever be 14 & I'll always be that lost 16 year old girl with too much weight on her shoulders. It will never leave.I miss you.;I type 11 years and it seems like such a long time.

1bwbm48;Advice?;JoshGrobensGrobussy;TW: Mention of suicideMy childhood best friend died back in September of 2023. When I say best friend, I mean best friends for all of middle school and high school. We were so close and hung out every single day. When we couldn’t hang out we would FaceTime for hours. I loved her so much and the only thing that ended up separating us was distance. I moved to a different state far from our original state and lost contact over the years. I thought of her very often and hoped to one day reunite. I ended up visiting home a few weeks before she passed and thought about asking her if she wanted to catch up. It had been years since we actually talked so I chickened out on texting her. Come to find out just a few weeks later she committed suicide. It has been eating me alive ever since. I feel a sense of guilt, like I could’ve been the reason she was alive if I had just reached out. Maybe all she would’ve needed was one person in her life and I could’ve been that person for her. But I wasn’t. I was too scared she would think I was weird for texting her after all these years. (Roughly 5-6 years) I have been having a really hard time with her passing in general but I feel like I’m an imposter. I haven’t been part of her life for so long. I keep asking myself, am I even allowed to be grieving her? Am I being overdramatic? Every single day I wake up and she’s the first thing I think about. My family hasn’t been very helpful with the situation either. They said themselves “You aren’t even friends with her anymore so you can’t be that sad about it” and other remarks like that. Idk maybe I am just perpetuating it but something about her death I can’t shake. I feel the lack of her presence on this earth in my bones. There will be days that she is the only thing I can think about and it makes it hard for me to actually do anything other than lay around.

1bwaka3;5 weeks after losing my mum;saladfriends63;These past five weeks have been a surreal haze. I’m barely plugged in and I feel both everything and nothing at all. I feel somehow changed, as if I’m inexplicably, fundamentally different. Five weeks ago I called the police to do a welfare check on my mum after she went radio silent following giving away many of her belongings. My world split open when the police officer called back to say he found her body and there’s been blackness ever since. Being the eldest of my siblings, I’ve had to navigate dealing with ongoing police/coronial investigations, her real estate lease/them threatening to sue me, raising money to pay for a funeral because she only had $25 to her name (I’m a recent uni graduate looking for work), and trying to help my younger sister find somewhere to live as this has made her homeless. I feel exhausted to the point where I’m concerned that my lupus (was thought to be in remission) is coming back. I’ve needed to borrow money from friends to pay rent as I can’t stop crying at my retail job. I just don’t understand how anybody is meant to cope with all of this plus somehow manage and process the grief of such a traumatic loss. I feel angry that I can’t look after myself while trying so hard to look after everybody else. I keep having these moments of deep terror and panic whenever I realise that she’s actually gone forever, like she’s not just out somewhere taking time to herself. It feels like this burning ball of lava in my chest that’s pushing to get out. Other times I’m just sad because I miss her, wished our relationship was different in the last couple of years and trying my best not to blame myself. I don’t know what question I’m asking here, I guess I’m looking for some kind of validation or reassurance? Proof that it gets better?

1bvb0u3;3 months later;Nervous_Sherbert_453;it's been about 3 months since my mom committed suicide and I'm a little more stable I guess you could say but still I feel like there's just a permanent hole in my heart and no matter what I do the image of when I found my mom is etched into my brain. I shouldn't have had to witness what I did, my mom should be here with me right now. It's not fair. I know suicide is a complicated thing bc i've dealt with my own mental health problems for years but im still just so angry deep down that my mom went through with it. after her initial attempt months before that led her to be in the psych hospital for 3 weeks, she spent months apologizing for what she put us through but then months after that she just planned everything out so she could do it when I wasn't home. and I was the one who found her with my dad after he had dropped me back off at her house. that day she texted me that she had a good night and didn't answer any of my texts or calls after. I assumed she was just asleep which has happened in the past but now it's obvious that she must have committed not long after she texted me. and that's what really gets me. The fact that I have to live the rest of my life without my mom, the person I've always loved more than anything in the world and live with the trauma etched in my brain just hurts. especially because I've struggled with my own mental health and suicidality since I was a teenager and she's the only reason I stayed.

I am feeling the need to get a different job for a different perspective, because I feel my coworkers are judging me because of my grief, a new job would offer an opportunity for me to have a clean slate with nobody knowing what happened to me. Due to interpersonal conflict my coworker is no longer speaking to me, and has not been speaking to me for one month and my supervisor won’t do hardly anything about it.Also, thinking about moving, my mother has found out that her breast cancer has returned and she’s in her 80s and I think it’s a strong possibility that I am going to be needing to take care of her, and I will need another bedroom to facilitate that. I am already her IHSS worker, and I prepare meals for her.

Before that I moved out for the first time in my life at 18 because of my abusive father and toxic household. I wanted to try and make something a little bit better for myself. I had been depressed for nearly a decade and I just wanted an attempt to be happy. Then only after 4 months of moving out my mom did it. Then I got into a car accident where I totaled my car and almost died. A few months after it happened my grandpa died of cancer. Then I got fired from my job. I was forced to move back in with my abusive dad My only hope of living was my mom was suppose to enherit an apartment nearby my college and I asked my uncle (who was in charge of it) if it’s possible I could move in after the current tenants lease is up (asked in may 2024. Lease would be up may 2025) because my father is so abusive. He said yes of course. That was the only thing keeping me going for this whole year From then till now.

1buzo9l;suicide of my abusive father;oneforthepicklebacks;hello <3I love reading everyone’s memories of their loved ones in here. unfortunately my story is a bit different so I apologize if this is not the place for me.one month ago, I received a call from my mom that my father had committed suicide. the first thing I said was that this was shocking news, but not surprising. my father had always been emotionally abusive, and my relationship with him was extremely rocky at best. between bouts of abuse he would gaslight and reel you back in. it was truly a toxic cycle. i’d need a book deal someday to explain it all.the day he committed suicide he had been at couples therapy with my mom, who had been strategizing the safest way to leave her marriage for years. during the session, his abuse turned physical (in front of the therapist) and that night he took his life.i have many friends my age (20s) who have lost their father, and many friends who have experienced the suicide of a loved one. but I am having trouble finding a support group for such a niche and complicated death.my father left evidence that he did this to hurt and traumatize my family, specifically my mom. many grief support groups for suicide would probably try to correct me if I said “he did this to hurt me” and understandably so. but he left a note the cops wouldn’t let my mom see, they said it was unforgivably hurtful and she should never read it. he mailed my brother and I a series of letters that came up until 2 weeks past his death that we also chose not to read but I can only imagine their content. this is not “typical” suicide if such a thing exists, and what i’m haunted by most lately is not the death itself, but 24 years of parental abuse and family trauma.I would love to find some kind of support group or network for my little brother and I. somewhere we can safely and honestly express both what we’ve been through and what we are going through now with this final act of terror.I know who he was but it is still so hard when I remember the few good memories with him, though that was hard from the beginning because for every good memory there are many traumatizing ones.if anyone had any recommendations for my family i’d love to hear them.

1buvjn1;Dealing with complicated grief 8 years on;Interesting_String_2;My Dad took his own life 8 years ago, when I was 15. He had Borderline Personality Disorder, was abusive in pretty much every way, and attempted suicide a couple times a month for the last few years of his life. I had to help my mother look after him and intervene in his attempts as there just wasn’t anyone else. It still is so hard to admit but it was a relief when he died. I just knew that if he lived for any longer the course of my life would be irreparably changed. In the years since, more and more horrific stuff that he did has come out and now I feel like I can’t grieve him at all as my mother’s family will think that I don’t care what he did. I do care, it hurts so much knowing all of that and was and still is devastating, but he was my Dad and I still love him. He used to call me his best friend and the only person in the world he could trust. I know now that was probably just manipulation but I still sort of want it to be true. It makes me so angry that not only do I not get to have the Dad that all my friends and family do, but I don’t even get to mourn him. I’ve been in my country’s mental health services since before my Dad died, and I’ve gone through every level with each saying I’m ‘too complicated’.

1burttq;When will the grief & guilt end?;depressedmouse56;It's been 4 years since my brother passed away. It still feels like a cruel joke, like a fake reality I've created in my mind. I try not to dwell on the day he died, but witnessing it truly shocked me. Especially since I was the last one to see him, and that day I wasn't feeling too good, so I didn't say hi to him that morning. He was 7 years older than me. But now it's only 3. I lost a lot of friends, and even now I am angry, shocked, and tired. But since it's been 4 years, everyone expects you to get over it. I don't know, I just can't believe my big brother, whom I really loved, is gone. I just wish I could talk to him one more time. I wish I could tell him that it would've been okay, that he is loved, that he wasn't a burden, that we will pull through. But maybe he's at peace now, I suppose. This life wasn't kind to him. I just want to feel like I am living again and not stuck at 19, in the winter, on that day.

1budsgu;The guilt;silentgardeneel;It just doesn't go away.I feel like I think in circles. As soon as I managed to concince myself it wasn't my fault here I go again because I saw my favourite picture of her and my brain goes: Why is she gone?! How can this be?!And the explanation I always come up with is to think about all her issues she had... and how she didn't get the right help... suffered silently... and there is so much for me to blame myself for.Every little mistake I made. Arriving 30 minutes late to our last ever meeting. Being late so often in general. Not thinking anything of it when she gave things and money away. Letting her walk home alone at night cause I didn't want to leave the appartment anymore as I was feeling bad myself, three days before she did it...Had I known what she was planning I would have never let her go and would have been on time to our meeting and not left early just to call my girlfriend. I didn't even call her right away, I sat around chatting to acquaintances for a while. Maybe half an hour. Half an hour I could have spent with my sister instead on our last ever cafe visit...That seems so valuable now. I was so distracted that day. If I had been more attentive. Had asked her more. Made plans for the weekend already she maybe would not have done this.I know it is unfair to me too to think that way. I didn't know. I thought it was one meeting of many more. I thought we'd have so much time. I was just worried she dieted too much. That was my concern.But the guilt keeps coming back.;It just doesn't go away.I feel like I think in circles.

1bu8m9g;It's been three months. ;p_jewel99;This is just my shout into the void, rambling mind. I'm not sure what I'll gain from posting this. If I'm not feeling numb, I'm feeling angry. In the beginning, I felt like I was more compassionate towards him, like I could understand and empathize that he was in so much pain that he didn't feel like there was any other way out. I understood that addiction plagued him, and that his family was so broken, and he was so lonely. But now, when I think about him, I just feel such anger towards him for doing it. And then I feel guilty for being angry. And then I change the subject in my brain. Because after these 3 months, it feels like it was an event that happened, but has passed, like a car accident. Like, the accident happened, but we have a new car and the event is over. Until I remember that it isn't over, and it always will just be. The reality is that he is gone. And then I feel angry. That he's gone forever, and he decided that for himself and for us. I feel helpless, knowing I can't change it. I feel like I can accept the fact that he did the act, that he committed suicide, but not that fact that he's gone forever. The seasons changing has been hard for me. Going from winter to spring has felt gut-wrenching. I know he would have felt better, he would have been outside more, and he would have been hiking and hammocking. I have a hard time when I experience a beautiful moment. A sunset. A new milestone of my daughter's. A night out celebrating a birthday. He should get to experience those too. And then the cycle continues... I think about him, I feel sad that he isn't there, I feel angry that he chose to not be here, and then I feel guilty for being angry at someone who felt there was no other way. Then, I change the subject in brain, once again feeling guilty that I can't even think about him. And I worry that I'll never be able to think about him again, at least, not really. Not the way I used to. I just miss his smile, I miss his laugh, and I miss him. That's all.;This is just my shout into the void, rambling mind. I'm not sure what I'll gain from posting this.

Now I have enough energy to read other genres, fiction books or nonfiction books. I started thinking my life is like a book, too. Nobody might read it, but my book has my story. Imagine, you are reading a book. You get into the lead character. In the story, the lead character’s loved one dies by suicide. What if the story ends there? You are like WTF! Right? No, the story must not end there. It could be a very sad story from there. It could be very hard to read it or write it. But I can’t end my story here. Neither can you. Our loved ones decided to end their story this way. That was the ending they gave to their books. But it does not end our books. Because they are not the authors of our books. This is my book, my story. Only I can write it. How I end it is my choice. Only I can give it a good ending. To give a good ending, I have to work hard, I know.

1btu9hi;The Magnitude of This Is Unimaginable;Infernus-est-populus;"My only child killed himself three months ago. He was 22.I was scheduled to give a talk the day after Mother's Day this year. I am not a celebrity but I have a somewhat public career and this talk (paid) was booked a year in advance. Doing a speech just wasn't front of mind until the organization sent the publicity material to me.I debated: should I push through? The last time I gave this talk my son came with me because I don't like driving alone at night. Even less so, now. So I sent the organization a politely worded message about what happened and that I should probably cancel. They replied: ""I totally understand that you must be feeling very fragile and that making plans is difficult...."" but they wanted to convince me to carry on. They also knew about my son from social media and assumed I would include it in my talk.I was a little taken aback. Am I behaving like I've got it all together? I didn't think so. For the most part, people have seen me be visibly hollowed out and undone. I talk openly about anguish both online and in person but I haven't really interacted much with the world at large. I guess no one really notices the older woman with tears streaming down her face at the grocery store. It's hard to realize that the world ... doesn't get it, at least not until you tell them.I wrote back: ""It's not ""feeling fragile"" as much as the catastrophic and violent loss of my only child detonated a nuclear bomb and blew up my life..."" I also wrote that I hadn't worked in the field they wanted me to talk about in months because of my son's death and was unsure if my career would even continue. I told them that both my spouse and my grief counsellor recommended against doing this talk. They apologized.I thought I was being pretty open with my emotions regarding the magnitude of this event but it makes me realize that only people who really get it are the ones who have been there.Anyway, that's my rant.

1btgqzu;Struggling with my partner;kayybugg946;"My brother committed suicide last July. He was staying at my house with my current boyfriend. We've moved since then to avoid triggers, and I've recently been in counseling. My boyfriend's birthday was in January, and he was hinting that he wanted a party. This was months before January, and my boyfriend was consistently nagging me if I had made any plans. He often asked if I contacted his sisters/family to start planning. I was getting annoyed because I felt that I wasn't exactly in the right headspace to be planning or even thinking about... life in general, lol. After weeks of his nagging, he hit a nerve when he said ""I bet you haven't even contacted my sister yet, huh?"" I felt guilty because he was right, I hadn't. I felt I had a lot of time still and when I was ready I would contact them, but I didn't communicate this with him. I sucked it up and contacted his family to start planning. I planned a surprise party with my family, it was small and a bit last minute because everyone got sick (Including myself) but luckily I already bought the decorations and had help from my sister-in-law. For the other party, I contacted his best friends and sent 300$ to his sisters because it was held in California. I drove us both to Cali and helped while I was there. I was still sick and only got sicker. (I also went to work while sick because my job doesn't provide sick day pay. I was afraid I wouldn't have financially pulled it off if I missed workdays). I did not have a good time, but I kept this all to myself because I didn't want to make it about me when it was his birthday.  I was happy and relieved when it was over, and I felt I was getting over the resentment I was holding onto against my boyfriend...until now when my birthday is coming up.He recently told me that he WANTED to throw me a surprise birthday party, but now he's stressed out because it's coming up and he doesn't know what to do... I was angry when he told me this. First of all, I told him I didn't want a party. I was fine with something small. and second,.. if he was going to throw me one then why tell me lol. I felt he did the bare minimum before giving up and asking me to plan for ... my own party that I didn't even really want lol. I feel split, I wish he hadn't told me and given more effort to planning something if that was his plan. But now that he told me he was originally going to throw me a party and wanted my help.. it was for him not for me. I just felt that I wasn't worth the effort, and he wanted me to take charge and plan things.. like what I always do. I was confused about why I felt so angry and confused about what I wanted for my birthday. So I wanted to address this in counseling before expressing how I felt, but this didn't happen.My boyfriend noticed that I was being distanced, and he pushed me to talk to him; I told him I didn't want to discuss anything until my counseling appointment, but he kept pushing me until I broke. He told me the reason why he pushed me about his birthday was because he wanted me to be involved. He knew his family would be planning on something. He also said that I didn't communicate with him about my feelings so of course I would be angry since I sucked it up and he didn't. He said he canceled the surprise party with my family and told them I didn't want a party, and we could go to Vegas or something. He didn't apologize or anything. I just feel he was incredibly selfish to not consider me when I was very vulnerable. There was so much change between my brother's death and my boyfriend's birthday. I felt that I was still processing everything. To be honest, I don't even want to celebrate my birthday, it's just not something I'm looking forward to, I'm just trying to breathe. & now with all this resentment surfacing back up, I don't want to ""celebrate"" with my boyfriend. Unfortunately, I feel triggered, and I don't know how to move past it. Luckily I have a session tomorrow, but I felt I needed this off my chest.  I know life moves on, but how do we celebrate things like birthdays and Christmas as if nothing happened.. I just feel stuck.";My brother committed suicide last July.

They only wanted to talk about her, so I stopped talking to them.I guess they asked my brother why I wasn't talking to them. He answered by telling them ""things weren't sunshine and rainbows"" and that ""[keicantus] wasn't close to her"".I want to throw up. Are you fucking kidding me? Before I cut her out of my life we were dangerously enmeshed.  We were SO close.  I was her perfect little kid. Just because I woke up to her abuse first doesnt mean I didn't love her. I know he didn't mean anything by it, but hearing him say it so casually shattered me. Is this what my family really thinks about me? That I am callous?

1bs7ago;Happy Easter I guess ;HalOO101;First thing I did today was visit my ex-girlfriends grave. She passed two weeks ago and I never got to go to her funeral so this was very important for me. I left flowers, a handwritten note for her and a rock that I painted when I was in grade 11, it’s meant to be symbolic so I left it at her grave. I talked to her and told her how loved she was and how beautiful and impactful she was on my life. I kissed her grave and left. I know I’ll visit her grave again soon. I could somehow feel her presence there.It’s not been easy for me and I can’t begin to imagine how the immediate family must feel. I miss her everyday. She only just turned 20, and I’m 19. She’ll miss the best years of her life and I know I’ll have to carry the guilt and grief for the rest of mine. I wish I got to say goodbye, and I wish I told her I loved her more. There’s so much I regret, but all I can do is try to move forward. I’m just glad that my first love was someone as beautiful and gorgeous as her, I just wish I told her that when she was alive.

As if I have been cut open and poked by a hot iron. Sealed up with salt. I ask myself why. I ask myself how. I imagine another life, one where you’re here. One where you were treated with the dignity and respect that you deserved. One where those threats by seemingly meek and yet malicious were empty and you understood the callousness of their threats.  One where I had been there to diffuse the situation, like I had since I was a child. One where I didn’t feel like every day was a punishment. I woke up thinking about you asking Alexa the time or weather even though you knew the response. Asking Alexa how many days until the next holiday, during the evening of that holiday. your Alexa saying good morning name filtered and her response.

1bs0s0j;My Brother is depressed and it's scaring me that it'll happen again. Is this normal? Any advice?;Accomplished-Comb294;Hi so I dealt with a family members suicide just under 2 years ago. It is the 2nd time I've had someone close to me die this way. Every time someone is on their own I worry they'll do it. It scares me. What is especially scary is my brother is becoming increasingly withdrawn and quiet. He doesn't seem to enjoy much anymore. He is late teens so some of this is normal development. He just drinks and gets drunk, when I ask if he wants to do something he always says no. I keep getting very anxious he will do what the others have done and it's a hard feeling to sit with.When he was drunk last he got emotional and told me stuff that was bothering him. I've told some family members that he is down but not shared any of what he told me specifically as I don't want to breach his trust.I understand I have to accept the uncertainty and accept that my feelings are valid. I understand that e everyone gets down at timea and all I can do is be there for him but it's easy to say and understand what I must do, it's harder actually doing it.I start then feeling angry about the people who've done it in the past and the horrible feelings they're still causing me. I don't like feeling this way.I then start feeling that someone is trying to force them to do it, someone who is out to get me. This is obviously unsubstantiated but I've had psychosis and paranoia in the past so it's also something I'm dealing with.I have a therapist and I've not seen him for a few weeks because of Easter and other reasons, so I think I'll talk about these things.Any advice is welcome.

1brn92r;I decided I can’t tell them it was suicide ;Jolly-Steak6263;Edit: Thanks everyone for sharing your stories, it helps a lot, I feel less alone in this journey.I’m sorry we have to go through this.You guys are amazing! Our close family and friends know, but everyone else, including some friends, acquaintances, colleagues, shopkeepers and other random people I haven’t told.I naively told some people at the beginning, then started finding it difficult and triggering having to deal with their questions and reactions, comfort them and apologise because they get horrified after learning that it was suicide.Some people are very pushy and curious, they want to know how he died and when I say it’s suicide they want to know why, wether he had any mental illness, when I answer they want to know but why depression what happened what caused it and it’s like opening a gate of endless questions.It’s very insensitive and I feel interrogated just to satisfy their curiosity.I know it’s morbid curiosity but at the same time I don’t benefit from this and it leave me with an overwhelming feeling of being exposed.They end up saying something not helpful and I know they will just have one more story to gossip about.I feel exposed, walking with a label ( the lady who’s partner killed himself)It’s still early in my grief journey, but i decided I can’t tell everyone about it, but at the same I don’t want to lie.I feel vulnerable and each time I share it with someone, they get awkward or worse I can sense their pity, and I feel the wound gets open again and it ruins the rest of my day. I don’t want support from people who don’t understand suicide or mental health struggles.I know hiding it doesn’t help mental health struggles awareness or suicide awareness but I don’t have the strength at the moment to deal with the real word, answer their questions.I’m all for activism, and will start sharing in honour of his memory, but not now. I’m broken and have to protect myself.I don’t know if anyone felt or experienced the same thing.How do I avoid answering the famous question how did he die?

1br6pby;There's no such thing as hospice for mental health;saga_of_a_star_world;"My brother passed away in December.  This week the coroner finally notified my dad that it was suicide.  My brother had struggled with depression on and off for 15+ years, and was dependent on alcohol (probably addicted to gambling, too, at the end).  A couple of weeks ago I learned that his good high school friend, S, was in hospice.  S had battled cancer for years.  When he was diagnosed they gave him three years--that was twenty-three years ago.  It's heartbreaking and tragic for a man in his fifties to be on hospice, but there's a respect to it, too.  He fought for years and years, and he just doesn't have the energy to fight anymore.  We honor that decision, we tell him he's been tough and brave long enough, and if he can't go it anymore, that's okay.But we don't have that same attitude towards suicide, do we?  We have a hard time applying that same reasoning.  My brother fought depression for years and years, and he just didn't have the energy to fight anymore.  It's hard getting away from my sense of abandonment to have the compassion to give him the same grace that I give S.  I did, and after coming to this realization I had a visitation dream about my brother.  I walked in his room and he was sitting at a computer desk.  (Never mind that in real life there was no computer desk in his room--where he was sitting is where the closet is).  I exclaimed, ""you're here!"" and hugged him.  He told me that I gave him peace--and this is pretty significant, since he didn't speak the other times I dreamt of him after his death.  I asked if Tinkerbelle the dog was with him, and she trotted down the hall.  She greeted me, I greeted her, and then put her on the bed so she could be with my brother.  I am convinced that I only had this dream because I had come to terms with his death being a suicide, and finally moved on from the bargaining and blaming (why didn't he seek therapy, etc?) to give him the grace of recognizing how hard his struggle was.  I don't know if I'll have any more dreams about him--I hope I do--but I at least have the knowledge that he is now at peace and with the little girl he loved so much.";My brother passed away in December.

1bqagcr;Everyday is an absolute nightmare ;Curious-Fortune6061;I’m planning a memorial instead of a wedding. My fiancé has been struggling with addiction for a few years. What became fun partying turned into unstable coping. He struggled with depression, and as we continued to grow our relationship, his depression became impossible to manage. As the depression got worse, so did the drinking. Two months ago, I reached out to his friends and family in the hopes of getting support. His family is not big into mental health so they were truly focusing on him not drinking him quitting drinking would’ve been great but the root of the drinking were his demons. I asked his family multiple times to come out to sit down with him and have some more of an intervention and get him checked into inpatient and they said that him returning to his hometown for a week with solve the problem.His family was under the impression that he didn’t drink the first three days that he was there and that he was “doing great, back to his old self”. On the fourth day of him being home, his parents went on their planned vacation to Hawaii leaving him in his childhood home alone. He called me the first night they were gone drunk, and I asked him what he was doing and he said he was sitting in the dark and his dad‘s recliner with a bottle of whiskey.He returned home after the week worse than I have ever seen him. He was completely distraught, and at a loss of what to do, and asked for alone time.  When I asked what he needed, he decided getting a hotel for a couple days to get out of the house and get space after his , disappointing trip home was what he wanted to do. I was worried about him drinking, but thought maybe some alone time would do him good.He showed up every night that he was supposed to be at the hotel drunk. Last night he showed up and we were able to have a conversation try to get down to the root of the problem and he agreed to get checked into inpatient the next morning. That night he returned to the hotel, and drank to a point of .28 alcohol blood content, and made the drunken choice to take his own life. I have lost my best friend, my life partner, and my soulmate. I’m at a loss of what to do where to go or how to live life without him. I saw the daily struggle and I know he is at peace but I will never Completely let go of the fact that we fought this battle together for so long and the disease finally won and took our lives. I might still be here but my life as I knew it is completely gone.Sorry for the long text, but if there’s anybody out there that is experiencing something similar, I would love to hear any words of advice . Added: after losing my fiancé, his family has completely blamed me blocked me out of their lives, taken his ashes, and deleted me from his entire social profile. They even went and deleted his voicemail and changed it back to his phone number because they knew I was listening to it every night. The blame the shame and the guilt when I feel like I’ve tried everything is so insurmountable. They didn’t allow me to come to his funeral and his hometown so I’m doing a memorial in Colorado and they went as far as reporting the go fund me as fraud. The drama and the blame game has made it so hard to start grieving in a way that honors my person.;I’m planning a memorial instead of a wedding.

1bq7zv2;A year and a half. This is who I am now, I guess.;DreamsOfCalm;My brother took his life in late 2022. At the time, I was on an ambitious run, going to school, working full time, working on a barely successful youtube channel with potential.I've tried being patient, and tried relearning that discipline. And I guess that part of me is just gone now. Got an A.S. for IT, never got work in the field. I feel a bit like I'm just rotting at my current job, but the pay is better than most entry IT jobs I would qualify for, and I just lack ambition to keep applying.My youtube channel was kind of like a special thing to me. My brother would watch them and even found the jokes in it funny. I went from uploading weekly to just, occasionally uploading some quick and easy garbage.I'm not sure what point I'm even getting at. I feel insecure my wife won't stick around, though we have grown closer and she doesn't mind the job I have. But still, it feels awful to be in this position.But I guess this is who I am now. I don't know if I'm okay with it. But I do feel strong in my resolve to live, to care for my aging parents and be as good a partner as I can, even if it feels like everything else I worked hard towards was either a waste of time or potential.I'm not sure what I really am getting at...does anyone else feel this way?

1bq7ob9;4 years + 4 months since my dad died ;always-wondering96;4 years + 4 months since my dad died, and 5 years since his first suicide attempt.  2019 was one hell of a year. January 2019 was his first attempt. My mom and sister stayed up all night long looking for him after he didn’t come home, fearing the worst. I slept but was awoken at 5 am to a call from my mom who was hysterical, telling me what he had done. He almost didn’t make it that first time. As in, just minutes from passing away. To me, that was confirmation from God that my dad would stick around, if he survived such a close call. The next several months were good. He seemed happier, like he was improving. I felt so encouraged. Then, on October 13th, one day after my brothers birthday and one day before my husbands birthday, I hear my mom sobbing as she walks into the house saying he had succeeded.  They found him, and he was gone. The whole world felt like it went dark that day. I had always been so close to my dad and yet he didn’t even want to say goodbye. My dad wanted to die so badly that he used multiple methods to ensure he wasn’t going to make it. Since then, I’ve become a completely different person.  My mental health has been terrible since then and I’ve struggled with crippling panic attacks and anxiety, insomnia, and depression. I have some days where I do feel ok, or good even, so I want others to know that it doesn’t stay as hard as it was in the first few months/year. You do grow around the grief as they say. But my mom lives in my childhood home 5 minutes away from me and I’m surrounded by memories in the city I live in. I’ll never stop missing him. I don’t know what the point is of this post other than that it feels good to get this pain off my chest sometimes. I’m so sorry to anyone else who deals with this pain. It’s truly awful.;4 years + 4 months since my dad died, and 5 years since his first suicide attempt.  2019 was one hel;;2;14;2024-03-28 21:45:22;2024-03-28;Thursday;21:45:22;1782;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.501871

It was just us 3, there isnt grandparents etc and now it’s just me and our son.I’m back to I can’t eat, I have nightmares whenever I sleep, I’ve made up our son is sick to get out of work and honestly I’m just going to quit because I can’t work in mental health right now.Everyone’s stopped checking in, it’s been nearly 3 months so I’m not surprised. His dad got in contact by looks of it to find out as much information as possible then just ghosted.I need a copy of the death certificate and I have no idea how to get it, I’ve messaged the embassy 4 times over the past month and they never get back. Where he was on holiday told me to fly over with a marriage certificate, we weren’t married for 1 and I can’t just get a flight. I can’t even get our sons passport without it.I can’t believe he’s gone, I’ve friends I can speak too but he’s who I spoke too. I still can’t move his toothbrush, his aftershave. His clothes from his have been put in suitcases and put out of sight. His clothes I had here are still untouched. The glass of water he left is still next to the bed. He’s gone because he wanted to be gone, I can’t believe he hid that so well. It’s our sons 1st birthday in 3 weeks, I can’t believe he’s not here for it. He won’t be here for any of his birthdays. I miss him so much, I’d do anything for him to be back. I’m completely falling apart and don’t know how to stop it, I tried therapy and had to pause it because I literally can’t talk about him without breaking down.All of this has brought out my grief from losing my mum too, like fuck me if I don’t have him to speak too I need to cry to my mum right now and have her advice and I can’t get that either because she’s dead too.This didn’t end his pain at all, all it did was pass it on;I’m a mess, I’m really not in a good place.I tried to go back to work and it’s like it’s set somethi;;11;40;2024-03-28 17:21:43;2024-03-28;Thursday;17:21:43;2028;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.504509

1bpz1bb;My sister (37) committed suicide recently and didn’t leave a note;bunnyfood317;As you can imagine we (the family) were left with a lot of questions.  A quick backstory of my sister , she’s attempted other times before some of which we did not know about. My mother said since she’s been in her stomach she knew something was wrong with her. She was different, sadly my mom did what she could.  My mom thought she was just really rebellious. My sister got pregnant at 16 and she tried to commit while pregnant, my mom took her get mental help but my sister would refuse. I am 11 years younger than her , growing up she was like a bomb ready to explode any second, she would be the cause of a lot of our family fights . It was hard being around her. She was mentally and physically abusive to her daughter now 21 although they were bestfriends and loved eachother so much. Her daughter was the reason she was alive, her daughter left her 2 months ago  and didn’t want to come back because she was tired of the mental abuse  and stress. That is what caused my sisters 1st attempt this year , we only saved her that day because she drunk sent a photo to my brother of her slit wrist. That was how we found out, she was released a couple days later. Her daughter didn’t want to be around her yet , my sister was a danger to her  at the time it was best for them to have more time apart. My sister started doing good was on medication , started a new job, stopped drinking. Things looked like they were getting better. I talked to her and she said she wished she would’ve died that day she did it but that she wouldn’t try it again. My brother was keeping tabs on her everyday and helping her out. But 2 weeks after she was released from the hospital she went through with her suicide on March 6,2024.  That same day she had texted her boss and said she wasn’t going to be able to go to work because her brother got into a really bad car accident. Which was a lie. She’s lied before her mom or daughter being sick to miss work. I wonder what she was thinking when she lied and  said her brother got into a bad car accident. This time we were not given a warning that she was thinking about ending her life. It was surprising to us all. That day she tried multiple ways to end it every way possible until she succeeded with hanging herself. She had time to stop and get help but she kept going. She didn’t want anyone to stop her this time. She didn’t leave a note but we are left with a lot of guilt and pain.  My sisters life had been very hard she always had problems in her life , never married, depressed and we believe bi polar.  mental illness runs in the family I was diagnosed bi polar 2 and have tried committing suicide myself . I have been feeling suicidal since my sisters death. It feels unreal that she is gone and going the way she did. I’ve been doing research on suicide but it still leaves so many questions. We will always go through life wondering and the what if’s . I know now that life doesn’t get better for some , my sister deserved a happy life she deserves to be here with us. It leaves me feeling hopeless;As you can imagine we (the family) were left with a lot of questions.

1bp900x;I really think it’s my fault, I can’t see how it’s not;;I’ll explain the back story but I genuinely think this is my fault. Yes the entire situation is a mess and quite long.Me and L we’ll call him, not real initial met 4 years ago in the gym. Started off as just general conversations then led to a no strings attached kind of situation. We went for food, we got really close, I ended up with feelings after a year of chatting/going for food/walks/drinks out casually/sex and told him this. Then I found out he actually had a girlfriend this whole time which I had no idea about. Things ended as soon as I found that out. 3 weeks later I found out I was pregnant. No idea how, I had the coil. I’m very pro choice but after multiple miscarriages with my ex before him (4) I said I can’t terminate to him and he doesn’t need to be involved, he can walk away no financial ties/visitation/I won’t tell anyone he is the dad.L came round to talk and told me him and his girlfriend had been very rocky and it was a toxic relationship, essentially begged me to terminate and I refused.  I kept saying he can walk away, we live in the same city but not close so it’s very unlikely we would’ve ever walked into each other. L said he wants to take a few weeks to think about it, he came back a few weeks later saying he had split up with his girlfriend and wants to be involved. I went if that’s your decision that’s fine, at this point I was 16 weeks and said I had a private gender scan so if he wanted to come to that feel free. We went together, he was made up and we spoke for hours after about everything and agreed if he wanted to be involved we can be civil for the child’s sake but he can still walk away any time but if he decides to be involved, I expect him to be fully involved as a father.4 weeks later, I’m 20 weeks or so now he says he needs to tell his now ex as they have mutual friends and she would eventually hear. Next thing he’s gave her my number, I’m getting death threats, she’s saying disgusting things about harming my child once born. I rang him like what the fuck, soon as I found out about her I was gone, I just couldn’t terminate. He then said he’s getting back with her, changed his mind and wants nothing to do with the baby. I’ve gone no bother, after 4 weeks of daily abuse/non stop no caller ID calls I got police to ring her and tell her if she doesn’t stop threatening me and the child I’ll get a injunction so she can’t contact. The police offered to go for one but I went just speak to her, as long as it stops I don’t care but I don’t need this while pregnant. They spoke to her and it all stopped.He rings me 2 weeks later saying it’s over for good, at this point I’m like I don’t really care you only need to contact me if you want to know the baby when born. She texts me a few more times off various numbers saying congratulations for ending their relationship, hope I’m proud of myself etc. I didn’t respond. He says he’s still unsure what to do but checks in every few days. When I had the baby I put as my profile picture on WhatsApp so I didn’t have to message everyone after a really bad birth. He sees and rings me, we chat, that’s it.6 weeks later he rings me and says he wants to meet our son, I said he can meet him once at this age if not involved. If he’s involved I’m happy to coparent. He comes around and meets him and says he’s in this for the long run. We talk everything through and somehow over the next few months manage to become really close again. Not together, but we became good friends. We coparented well, he stopped over a lot purely to help with baby etc. he asks me to be his girlfriend a lot and I refuse because I mean, look at what’s happened so far. We can coparent but we weren’t going to be happy ever after.Fast forward to our son is 18 months, we’re great friends, we argue sometimes over different parenting styles but things are good. We’re open with each other, far as I know we’re both single, we almost act like we’re together but both know too much has happened for it to work. He suddenly kills himself one night, no note, no contact to anyone.If I had of terminated, him and the girlfriend I originally knew nothing about would probably still be together and he’d be living his life. He told me when I was pregnant I ruined his life by keeping the child. I just said I gave him the option to walk away at any point.His friends are saying it isn’t me, his family are saying the same but realistically this was also a lot of stress from his point of view. Even if he was cheating. I don’t see any other way around this than it’s all my fault, I should’ve just terminated and this probably wouldn’t of happened. He made some mistakes but who doesn’t, some are bigger than others. He was a good man, with a kind heart who helped me a lot.;I’ll explain the back story but I genuinely think this is my fault.

1bp55zg;my sister died last year and we’re struggling to figure out our relationship with her husband - they were married for only 6 months and he lives 3000 miles away;climbinginthetrees;"edited: if anyone can think of another sub that might be a good place for this post, please let me know 💜tl;dr: My sister died by suicide 6 months after getting married to someone she had reconnected with 2 months before (they had been together 17 years earlier). The husband lives 3000 miles away and we barely know him, and I’m struggling to figure out how he fits into our world now that my sister is gone.My beloved sister died last June at age 47. She was a mother of an 11 year old son who had been struggling with depression, ADHD, anxiety,  and possibly bipolar-polar for a long time (looking back, probably since she was a teenager).Last November, my sister reconnected with a former boyfriend from 17 years earlier whom she had been very in love with, but due to life circumstances, they split up when she had to move back home ~3000 miles away - he lived in CA and she returned to the east coast.Although they still lived on opposite coasts, in November 2022 they reconnected and fell in love again and got married in January out in CA, without inviting any of her family. We were sad not to be involved, but we were happy that she seemed happy.Over the next few months, they would fly out to the opposite coast every couple weeks. My mom met him once or twice, but he did not become a part of our lives at all. I had known him a bit better because I met them when they were happy together years ago and I liked him.Their relationship during the beginning of 2023 had its ups and downs. One day, my mother and I received a text from her saying they were getting a divorce. Then that was dialed back a few days later saying it was a misunderstanding. I felt that this man was a really nice supportive guy for her and hoped things would work out. My mother really didn’t know what to think as she barely knew the husband.Then, heartbreakingly, my sister died by suicide in June 2023. I won’t discuss the heartbreak here at this time because it would be just too much and I have other questions.So this brings me to my question. We really struggled after she died to figure out how to relate to her husband. I mean, he was her HUSBAND! He has legal rights and partner rights, but to us he was basically a stranger.We went through a few months without finding a will, which was very difficult. My mother is quite organized, and has connections with professionals who would be instrumental in managing my sister’s estate (my sister worked in finance and there is a decent amount of money/property to manage). She also lived in the town next to my sister. The husband lives 3000 miles away and works a blue collar job. Just as the husband changed his mind and said he would manage the estate, my sister’s will was located which appointed my mother as the administrator of her estate, which left everything to her son.We (my sister’s family and friends on the east coast) are struggling to figure out how to relate to my sister’s husband. They were together for such a short period of time and it seems that my sister was mentally unwell during the time they reconnected and got married.I assume that from the husband’s perspective, that my sister may have appeared to be disconnected from us since she barely had us interact with him and she got married without us or any of her friends/family from the east coast. This isn’t true - although she was struggling, we love her dearly and would have done anything for her.Wow, such a long story, and so many more details could have been added. My basic question is what do people think? It has become almost impossible to have a good relationship with the husband. He’s 3000 miles away and deals with things in a very different manner than we do. The most recent (and somewhat final straw) was that he had my sister’s phone to try and access it, and he just informed us that he no longer has it ie. we should report it as lost. Sigh. 😔 I like this man and I tried to be there for him, but a lot of people n this coast were wary of him and viewed him as a stranger. After she died, he tried to be involved and get close to us, but it was just so awkward and such a hard time.At this time, I may just let our connection go, though I feel bad about it. He seems to have given up on relating to us, though he did connect to another group of my sister’s friends (also on the east coast), so at least he has some connection to her that way.My final realization was that it probably would have been helpful for us all to have gotten together for group therapy shortly after she died, so we could try and find some common ground, but it feels too late for that now. This has caused such a sad complication on top of such a heartbreaking tragedy 😔Thanks to anyone who read this far - it’s so difficult figuring out where to discuss this sensitive topic 🌻";edited: if anyone can think of another sub that might be a good place for this post, please let me k;;7;9;2024-03-27 15:49:24;2024-03-27;Wednesday;15:49:24;4796;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.517527

1box33t;Feeling Down in Life;SweetMinute1691;"Hi everyone, I am currently a 4th year uni student who is in a co op program at school. I lost my older sister in 2nd year and everyday it just gets more and more harder especially at school and my personal life. I just feel so sort of empty in a sense, I know I've lost a part of myself and I genuinely don't feel happiness anymore. Yes, ill have moments of fun with my friends time to time but then I think to myself, I'm coming home to no sister, to tell the day about, to show funny videos to and to give company to. I can see my friends don't understand and to some, I feel like they have forgot but I don't mind. Everybody has their own problems going on and I've never really been the type to speak about my feelings. It's just sort of a really numb feeling, like I'm stuck,  I don't genuinely know what to look forward to. At the moment I have to secure an internship to graduate for 8 months and that's in itself has been a stressful journey. It's so difficult to secure a position and I do have prior operations experience in a previous internship. I once had an intreview that went so well, the manager and I talked for about an hour she kept saying she saw me as a team member and then set up a teams meeting with the other interns. I met with them and then after, completely ghosted. Even after messaging the hr person two times, completely nothing. I had to reach out to my uni advisor who had to tell me the position has been filled. Absolute garbage, a big healthcare company too I must say. I guess that was sort of a tipping point of me, I just felt all these rapid emotions of like ""you are dumb, you will never get your dream job, no one wants you, you are an idiot, you should have done better."" I guess with dealing with the loss of my sister, having to secure internships in this insane market and completing school, it's just so much sometimes. I just feel worthless in a sense from all these events. I can handle pain, I can handle rejection in any aspects of life but sometimes, it does just get overwhelming. I'm only 21 but I feel like I'm 60 or something. How can I stop putting so much pressure on myself? How can I navigate through life in this circumstance? Thank you everyone for reading. I hope you have a great rest of the day or night wherever you may reside.";Hi everyone, I am currently a 4th year uni student who is in a co op program at school.

1bowohv;2 years;ForsakenBarnacle9440;2 years ago, my friend L took their own life at 18.Overall, this second year has been going better. I've started making new friends and the topic of their death is no longer the only one on my tongue. But no matter what anyone says, I'll always feel guilty. L was attempting suicide regularly since they were in middle school, where we first met. They tried to die even when we were no longer in contact. But I know I wasn't a good enough friend. They lived at my place before the day they jumped under a train. And for those several last days together, where we'd share a bed, they'd smoke in my living room and try telling me so many things, I was just completely focused on my work. I'd barely stay with them after class, I'd just go straight to bed. And I hate that because I missed out on our last moments together. I relive the day I found out. Very often. Not receiving texts for days, they wouldn't come home, I was growing anxious af. Then as I'm about to call the police or the hospital, there's that damn message posted on their insta story announcing they had died. There's the whole running away from the library, stepping outside and turning into a mess of tears. Then there's slowly realizing that yes, this is all for real this time. This took days. Then hitting rock bottom one night and almost dying. Then stagnating for a while, not able to eat, crying everyday, everything collasping around me.There's no comparing one's death to someone else's. There's just something about suicide. It's different. The blood and flesh on the rails because they didn't take the time to clean up properly was the last I ever saw of L and to this day that's killing me. The thought that them, who were so small, was hit by that massive train, and left unidentifiable. They couldn't have an open casket. I also don't want to heal. Because as long as I can keep living, I want to keep that pain, because that's all that's left of them. My last bond to them. I want to carry them. Sometimes in happy thoughts, most time in sad ones. It's just sad.Today I'm going back to the rails, bringing flowers. I almost never post pictures of them, because I have plenty, but all taken in the context of parties where we'd be half naked, dancing, drinking, even making out. I try to think of it as positive: we had a happy friendship. We had fun. So much fun. They were the only one who'd connect with me like that. We were passionate together, about dancing, about drawing, about artists we'd scream the lyrics of. It's a mess, I'm sorry. I needed to vent. Most of the time I try not to think about it because I don't have the time to cry and I want so badly to be happy. So today is meant to be also some kind of release. Today is the ugliest day of the year.;2 years ago, my friend L took their own life at 18.Overall, this second year has been going better. ;;2;6;2024-03-27 08:13:41;2024-03-27;Wednesday;08:13:41;2749;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.521250

1bopm62;Idk how not to screw up my kids ;Worried_Thought5014;My almost 3 year old was asking me today where daddy was. Was he at work? Why is he in heaven? It’s really the first time he’s brought it up almost a year out. He said he was sad and missed daddy. My chest just aches. It hurts. My 4 year old I have zero patience with. I feel like I’m always exasperated with her because the kids are so hard and I’m so exhausted all the time trying to do everything. I can tell she’s disappointed every time she asks me to play and I say no. She clings to my mom (her grandma) because she spoils her and it hurts my heart. I try so dang hard. I really do. But I’m tired. Really tired. I’m trying to parent and maintain our home and build us life and move on and heal and sometimes I just barely get through the day. I’m so terrified for them. Someday they’ll know he chose to leave us and it’s going to destroy them. They barely understand now that he’s gone and it hurts them. I can’t believe he tucked them into bed and went out and wrote a note before I got home from work. Did he even tell them goodbye? I’ll never know. Did he love us at all? He wrote he loved us more than anything and just abandoned two toddlers and a wife and dogs and a cat and a whole life we’d built that I thought we both loved. The worst part is that I didn’t even know he was struggling. I’m so frustrated that I can’t say he tried medications and inpatient and struggled for years, or that he was struggled with substance abuse and wasn’t in his right mind.

1bogqi2;is my friend trying to make me feel bad or am i being insensitive?;murmurmorose;"A dear friend of mine (ill call her S) recently died by suicide and it has been devastating. Right after it happened I reached out to another friend (41f, (I'll call her B)) that I (33f) have been close to for about 10 years. It just so happened that that same weekend she broke up with her gf and was understandably very upset. I asked how she was doing and the conversation quickly turned into me comforting her and trying to work through her own suicidal feelings. I tried to be there for her but I was also traumatized and confused. B kept saying things like ""I just want to disappear"" and ""I just want to sleep forever"" and I tried to keep my cool and be there for her, but I also was extremely upset because S had literally just died the day before. (B was acquaintances with S but they weren't close. B did comfort me but most of the conversation ended up being about her and her breakup.)Fast forward to now, a month and a half after S's death, and B texts me saying she has upsetting news about an ex-friend of mine (we were friends from age 13) but is not sure if I want to hear it since we havent spoken in over a year. I was unsure but B kept saying ""I just thought you'd want to know since you had been friends for so long."" I relented and told B to give me the news and she tells me her friend/my ex-friend tried to commit suicide and is now in rehab. I expressed my sadness for that friend and B hits me with a ""it's just so sad that she felt so hopeless and unloved."" That hit me really hard because I felt like she was implying that my ending that friendship led to our friend feeling unloved. Overall, I have no idea why B would tell me this news knowing I no longer speak to that friend AND that a loved one of mine had JUST died by suicide (which she seemed to find less important or sad than her breakup). I can't help but feel like she, in some way, WANTS me to feel bad. Am I off base here? How would you move forward from this? Sorry if this is confusing and TIA for any advice. I miss S so much and I can't bear to lose anyone else, but I also feel like B is being insensitive to me.

1boa2xn;a little rough lately;fourofkeys;hi all,  i am having a weird and uncomfortable time. my mom died 8 1/2 years ago by suicide. it is probably in my top two most difficult things i've ever experienced. things are different now in a lot of ways, i don't feel like the universe is punishing me, i don't think god is spitting in my face, etc. so there's been SOME healing, obviously.but my dad died back in december from long term alcohol abuse. i made it through the first few months just focusing on busy activities and things like: will i go to the funeral? waiting for more details to come, a date, organizing the time off, finding a dog sitter, processing seeing old family, and then going. when i got back from the funeral my feelings hit me so hard.you know how in aa they say that while you're in a meeting, your addiction is doing push ups in the parking lot across the street? that's what this grief feels like. like, i'm afraid this grief will keep getting louder like my mom's did until it is suffocating. i still think of it as adversarial instead of a normal part of life, because that's just how much it impacted me back then.some things are different, like i'm not drinking or smoking weed to cope. i am already in therapy and have been. i'm not in a new city, my finances are not contingent on pretending to be a functional student.but a lot of it feels familiar: being averse to pain, not wanting to feel it, being overwhelmed, sometimes having my day shaped by it. i spent my last three days off mostly lying in bed. i keep telling myself this is normal grief, this is just the decibel level of normal parental grief. but it's holding hands with that suicide grief, and that is really hard to look at and experience. thinking about who i was at that time, how impactful it was, the ways i was trying so hard to take care of myself but it looked to normies like i was just unhinged, it's hard. sometimes i think about that person and wonder how they survived it at all. i don't want to ask them because i almost don't want to acknowledge it. i climbed out of a giant hole at the edge of hell, i'm not eager to pay a visit.i found this old video in my gmail drive while cleaning it out. i'm standing in this abandoned quarry by my old apartment as the sun sets, and i'm filming myself sobbing on my phone camera. i cannot tell you what i thought i was capturing, why i did that. i posted a lot of drunken sad content to the internet for at least 2-4 years, until i figured out how to get sober with some help. i don't think this video was posted, it was just jarring to see myself during that period of time. it really hurt my heart to look at.i guess what's new now is also that i'm not fighting the feelings so much. i have accepted that i just have to feel them, and sometimes that honestly means dissociating for awhile, and then figuring out how to come back into my body. but it feels intentional, not like before.i guess i'm just curious about how others suicide grief shows up later when more people are gone, after some years? do you guys think about the person you were right after it happened? do you have a relationship with them? do they have wisdom for you?;hi all,  i am having a weird and uncomfortable time. my mom died 8 1/2 years ago by suicide. it is p;;3;7;2024-03-26 15:03:23;2024-03-26;Tuesday;15:03:23;3150;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.534731

Many of the stupid things she did which contributed to exacerbating her situation is becoming more and more distinct from other factors.I'm concluding more and more, that the things she did were all one big fat loads of mistakes.I dreaded date is approaching and I'm not feeling her pain anymore. I miss her, but I can't hold her pain more. I'm fighting the urge to listen to all the call recordings she left behind just to make up for the fact that I'm not grieving her pain. I often cry when I miss what she was for me. But I'm not able to hold HER side of story anymore.I'm hating that.....I feel bad about myself for being this way.;My little sister(18F, me 27F) died last year April 22.

1bnvz9j;Denial;stinkyelle;I posted in here a week and a bit ago, my mother killed herself during a psychotic episode just 2 weeks ago and I find myself constantly psychoanalysing myself.I seem to be okay during the day, with brief moments of realisation. however, i did a little experiment with myself last night and kept the thought in my mind that my mum was gone forever, she was never coming back, and I have to learn to be okay with that. I can’t lie, I had an absolutely awful reaction, crying, panic attacks and utter despair.As mentioned, I can keep these feelings at bay very easily, but I am so so scared for when realisation hits properly. her funeral is in 2 weeks and I fear I may have my realisation moment then. I have heard others talk about it taking years though. I’m just scared in case my world view is different after I realise this is real. I’m scared in case I’m different, in case I can’t handle it, in case the whole time, I feel like I did last night.

1bnqwo3;Just sad;Ok_Butterscotch4207;It’s been 10 months since my mom killed herself. Every time I even think of her I can’t help but cry. It still feels so fresh. Most of my days recently have been spent crying. Just knowing how much pain she was in to do that makes me sick and angry because she didn’t deserve that pain. She struggled with mental health her whole life. I remember being a kid and asking her about her (many) scars and thought she looked like a badass warrior. When I was 13 she told me they were self harm scars and my heart shattered. I don’t know what she must’ve been through as a teenager and young adult but I know that she didn’t deserve any of it because she was such a gorgeous person inside and out. Always lit up a room with her smile, even when she was at her lowest.I just really really miss her. I know her pain is gone but I wish she could’ve found peace here on earth. I was with her the day she died and she bought me a smores kit to use with her the upcoming weekend. We got tim hortons and she helped me write my first resume.The next morning she was dead. I don’t even have our texts anymore because my phone deleted them. She would always call me her treasure and her sunshine and I really believe I gave her purpose . She was declining for a while before she died and it scared me. I remember her telling me she always had a rope in case things got too tough. I laughed but she was serious, and she used it to hang her self in our laundry room. She was a fighter.Like I said, I don’t know what kind of demons she was fighting but I know they were significant because she did everything she could to try and get better. I miss you mom. She was my rock. Always knew what to say and how to make me feel better. I wish she had someone like that who could’ve helped her. My heart just hurts so much. edit: typos;It’s been 10 months since my mom killed herself.

1bno6j7;This has sent me to a very dark place;Jolly-Steak6263;6 weeks ago, my partner took his life after an argument and nothing can shake the belief that it was my fault.Although he had depression, bipolar, suicidal ideation well before meeting me, I can’t help but think my argument pushed him to do it.I said things that I held for too long, I was crying and hoping things would change in our relationship, I was trying to find a resolution, I was hurt and needed to be heard, I  didn’t see the signs, I was completely oblivious to the obvious! His suicide note made it very clear that it was my fault, he felt vulnerable, unwell and he was hurt by what was said despite agreeing with every point made.He said in his note that he couldn’t give me what I wanted/ needed and that he always knew that he wouldn’t be able to live without me if we ever break up.He didn’t answer my calls, didn’t give me a chance to talk, apologise, solve our problems, hug him,make him laugh, show him a cat video or tell him how much I love him. Just like during every other argument we had in the past.He asked for space and I wish I didn’t give him his space.I now know he was always considering suicide as an option when things go wrong, but I never understood it.Now I think I do, it takes staring into the abyss to understand how dark that place is and I think I could’ve never understood it until now!I can’t believe the love of my life was suffering so much and I didn’t know the extent of his pain.Reading his emails, notes, diary is very dark.Combined with the guilt, grief and the fact that he is gone forever makes me feel that I am now a living walking continuation of his suffering.I don’t want to pass this pain to the remaining people who love me, but it is a very very dark place in here and I’m so scared of my own mind.My favourite person in the whole universe is gone forever, please someone tell me this is not real.;6 weeks ago, my partner took his life after an argument and nothing can shake the belief that it was;;7;24;2024-03-25 20:33:35;2024-03-25;Monday;20:33:35;1858;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.545824
1bnlw01;My husband has been awful since our friend died.  Where do I draw the line?;throwaway54651255;He was my husband's best friend and best man at the wedding almost 15 years ago.  He died almost a year ago.  My husband has turned all his grief and anger toward me.  Right after it happened, I almost left because my husband's behavior went from cruel & petty but not crossing that threshold into abusive to straight up verbally and emotionally abusive on a frequent (sometimes daily) basis.  Once he identified that so much of his behavior was a result of grief, he was able to start therapy, antidepressants etc and things were getting better.  Until recently.As we come closer to the anniversary, the abuse has started back up.  The screaming, the insults, even pushing me around, over things that come out of nowhere.  Everything will be great and then I'll word something in a way that comes across as hurtful, and all the sudden he's telling me how worthless I am as a spouse, person, etc and how everything good in my life is thanks to him and him alone.  I know where it's coming from, and I'm trying to be supportive, but I can't drop everything for him (we work, we have 2 small kids, etc) and I can't keep allowing him to treat me this way, no matter how much pain he's in.  He does it in front of our kids.  He'll say later he doesn't mean it and he sorry (the typical abuser script), but I don't trust that anymore.  He used to have limits in a fight. Not sinceour friend's death. And I'm not expecting him to never be grieving or even to be grieving in a healthy way 100% of the time.  But I also cannot stand being in this relationship where I have to keep a smile on my face despite the mistreatment because he's grieving and anytime I get upset with him about his treatment of me I'm picking on him during an extremely difficult time.  He'll break down if I get angry at this behavior.  I don't know what to do.  I don't want to throw away our marriage after all this time because he's going through some major trauma, but he won't stop in the moment and asking for him to stop yelling just causes him to escalate.  IHas anyone else gone through this?

1bnixsf;My metaphor;TwistQc;In trying to put my feelings into words, I was reminded of a metaphor I liked to say: Life's a river. Some  have huge cruise ships, others tiny canoe, but eventually we're all going over the same falls, so we might as well make the best of it.When my best friend killed himself almost two months ago, it felt like my ship was struck by lightning and blew up. I was left drowning alone in the water, storm clouds raging overhead and tidal waves crashing down on me. There were times - so many - where I just wanted to sink and go over those falls. Then, so slowly, the storm calmed, replaced by an endless gray sky. And I'm still floating in that river, looking at the ruins of my ship behind me, and dark clouds coming rapidly over the horizon. The storms pass, and I can put my nose and mouth out of the water and take a quick breath. And there are islands. Small ones. Getting a beer with a friend. Going to the movies. Playing that video game we used to play. But I can't stay on those islands forever, and all too soon, I'm back beneath the salty water.And that's where I'm at now. I don't know more. I don't know if I'll someday find a log to hang on to, or even manage to rebuild a tiny raft. One day at a time, making the best of those little moments where I reach an island.;In trying to put my feelings into words, I was reminded of a metaphor I liked to say: Life's a river;;2;12;2024-03-25 17:08:45;2024-03-25;Monday;17:08:45;1282;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.550419

1bn8y86;Wondering if he thought about killing me before he decided to kill himself;Used_Opposite6;We were together for 8 years. I never thought he would commit suicide, I definitely never got the “he’s going to murder me” feeling throughout our relationship. It’s been a little over a year since so I’ve had some time to analyze this in between grief. When I can give myself a space to think about it, I have. We had a great relationship, we had our fights like any couple would, we started dating at age 16 so obviously we would get Into stupid fights I was usually pretty good at not saying any degrading insults, but he did when we would get heated about a year into our relationship. As the years went on he got better and would find better ways to tell me when I was a bitch rather than calling me one outwardly. I know that sounds like a red flag I ignored, which I did, but we were young and dumb and so I gave grace in that. Other than that there was really no disrespect in our relationship but as the years went on we felt great, occasional fights and lots of disagreements, but overall a respectful partnership. We worked well together, and to others that looked at us, we were a “perfect young power couple” I became more independent and tried to focus on my art more. I felt him “drifting” in a way for the last few years. I continued to communicate with him, even talked to him about getting into therapy because it was helping me a lot at the time. He started to not have passion in almost everything. When I would try to talk to him about it he would brush me off. I now live with guilt that this was a crucial thing I missed, logically knowing I couldn’t have known and I really did try. I think he snapped the night he did what he did. He had the day off and I had worked. After all that background I’m going to try to add as much details about that night and why I think he thought about killing meWe had plans for dinner, so he met me at a place down the road from my job. He had high energy and seemed to be in a better mood than normalI asked him about his day, he said he went to the dentist but not much else. What he didn’t tell me was he went to 3 different restaurants before meeting me at the one we were at and got a good amount of food at each. This was so out of character, he was very strict with his money and it was hard to get him to go out and eat for dates because he looked at it as a waste of money. The other thing he did that day was went to Walmart, and  bought a few random items for the house. But when I discovered this bag, my blood ran cold through my body. Inside it was a hammer. Okay, why couldn’t it just be another thing we needed for the house? Because we didn’t. We used to do a lot of renovation work and we had ample amounts of tools, we had already owned every kind of hammer you could possibly need. Literally owned 5 random hammers already.So here I am in the kitchen to the apartment my boyfriend just hung himself in the basement the night before staring at this hammer and wondering why. Why did you buy this $6 cheapest on the shelf wooden handle hammer that day. We had a wooden handle hammer in the stairwell going down to the basement where he left himself hanging for me to find him.After we had dinner together I was going down the road from our apartment to my cousins house. He asked if he could come which I wanted him to. I had worked all day I simply asked him if he could drive separate (we were already in separate cars and it made more sense) he started getting frustrated out of nowhere and acting like I didn’t want him to come. I explained to him that I wanted him to, I was really just going there to pick up some weed, and him and my cousin are friends so I also didn’t want to get stuck there because I also worked the next morning so that was mostly what was on my mind. I wanted him to also have the chance to spend time with them without me rushing out. I didn’t understand why he was being so irrational over it, he got out of my car and into his and that was the last time I saw him before he drove off. I texted him as I watched his car pull off to please drive safe and I love you. I waited a few minutes as called him 3 times with no answer. When he finally picked up, he was aggressive and cold. I asked him to just let me pick him up so he could come with me, he told me “no it’s all good” I wish I had seen the signs and I still feel like I failed him. When I got home I almost saved him that night. The paramedics told me for a half an hour that they were still working on him followed by the ear deafening sound of “he’s gone, theirs nothing else we could do.” He left me alone in our basement to cut him down and feel his weight hit the concrete. I lost it. My mind still goes numb thinking about it. My neighbors heard my screams and came running to help me immediately, luckily, they were trained in the Navy, they tried to help me give cpr until the pandemics got thereI still can’t understand why. I did so much for him and with him and I feel so hurt and betrayed. No note, just endless questions.;We were together for 8 years.

1bmumsc;My dad killed himself last month;littleloved_;We never had a good relationship. He was an emotionally abusive father who put me through hell and back, and that’s why I had to cut off our relationship when I was 13 (I’m 18 now). After my mom got full custody of me, I didn’t see my dad much. Only on times where my mom didn’t respect my wishes and allowed my dad inside the house to see me. This only made me feel more distant from my dad and put a strain on our relationship from getting better. I guess the only reason I was able to cut  my dad off so harshly was because I thought I had more time to maybe rekindle our relationship when I was older. I didn’t feel ready yet.My dad was never the person you’d think would kill himself. He believed that depression was of the devil and would constantly tell me that. When I was around 13, I confided to him that sometimes I struggle with suicidal thoughts. He laughed in my face. Thats apart of why I was so shocked when he committed suicide. He did struggle from things he never talked about, I realized that later in my life but he always had a happy demeanor. He was a very giving person, always going down to Mexico to help the poor, sending money every month to charities in different countries, ready to offer anyone help. He grew up in extreme poverty himself so he tried his best to share with others. And sometimes he was too much of a giving person because people in his life took advantage of him.He definitely made a lot of mistakes in his life. He hurt a lot of people but he had a good heart. I love my dad so much it’s just that his love hurt.The day before my dad died. My mom told me my dad wanted to end his life but he didn’t have the courage. I was really shocked and wasn’t sure what to do. I texted my therapist I had at that time telling her what my dad said. She replied to me “Hi. I think it’s a good idea because you may regret not doing it in the future. However, it’s important to remember that he is who he is. He doesn’t have the capacity to change on his own. If you have realistic expectations then you can engaged based on these expectations and set appropriate boundaries. It’s important to have that clear in your mind so you don’t get hurt.” After hearing that, I decided I’d think about it a little longer and prepare myself emotionally if I were to call him.He died that next day by jumping off a roof. If I had just called him the day before I might’ve have saved him or at least help to stay on this earth longer. I feel like a terrible person and I hate myself. I shouldn’t have waited to call. My dad was really depressed after “losing” me. Multiple family members told me this after he died. I genuinely feel so much shame that it eats me up inside. And I regret so much. I miss him so much, I just break down all the time. The images of his dead face haunt me. I try to think about what was going on in his mind but it just makes me drive myself crazy. I replay that day in my head constantly. I remember sitting on the ladder he used to get up on the roof to try to figure out why he would leave me. Tried to talk to him but that feels hopeless because he can’t hear me now. I never get to talk about this in real life. So I’m hoping writing this will help me in some way.If anyone reads this, thank you for listening ❤️;We never had a good relationship.

1bmtmiw;I lost my sister ;sekdahl;My sister committed suicide on 3/20/24 (we are assuming because of the time stamp of her note she left). My mother found her in her apartment on 3/23. My heart and body feel shattered. I feel like a piece of me is gone, which it is. I will never get over that she left me. Im so sad that I will never get to hear her voice or see her smile again. I’m angry that she abandoned me here. She was always my reason for wanting to go back home and now she’s gone and I have to go home to put her body to rest without ever getting to say goodbye. I know people say that there’s nothing I could have done when someone is in a dark place like this but I really feel like I could have changed this. I have been too absorbed in my own life to realize that she needed me more. I can’t understand how her pain could be so unbearable that she had to leave. I understand that she was sick but I never thought she would be in a place where her only option was this. I feel sick that her body had to be alone for days before she was found. I tried to do the right thing by giving her space during her times when she was really going through things mentally but I should’ve never given her space. I should have bothered her and annoyed her until she understood the amount that I loved her and maybe she wouldn’t have left me in the world alone.

1bmjdy8;Her arms were open but I just left;Anywhere_Else10;I lost my defacto partner last year 2023. Three days later I lost my job due to stupid decisions I/we had been making for a few years trying to keep us afloat from some bad investments my partner had made. We lost everything and then I lost her and I will soon lose my freedom. I’ve lost what I/we had visioned our future to be, I can’t see or feel joy, now or ever. I don’t know how to work through this grief from the traumatic loss of my life partner while at the same time grappling with all the demands for money, dealing with lawyers, loss of her family and my deserved criminal situation, it’s overwhelming. I’m grieving, I’m ashamed, I’m petrified and I’m so lonely. We had a fight on the day she did it, I normally never stay in my anger and give in (even when I shouldn’t) but that day I stayed in it and I left. My last memory of my love is not just the fight but she put her arms out for me to come back and hug her. I was too in my anger and I walked away. We never got to say I love you, if I had just gone to her and hugged her I would have then stayed with her. I turned my back and left, her open arms are embedded/burned into my head. What I did do is return to our home and performed one of her love languages and cleaned and did all our washing. What I didn’t know until she was gone, was I had rid our home of her beautiful smell, a smell I would tear the house apart hunting for hoping that I had missed a piece of clothing or anything to feel like she was with me. I didn’t want to sleep because I didn’t want to wake up and maybe for one second forget she was gone only to relive that instant trauma again. She didn’t leave a note, I know it was a last minute thought that came to her head, filled with guilt she had lost everything and our plan to be able to return the money and make back what she had also lost of our futures, It was just obviously too far out of her reach. She was a very proud person and had excelled at whatever she put her mind too but she had demons, we connected as a couple, in part, because of that. Both come from childhood abuse, adult sexual assault/harassment, sexuality discrimination and more.  COVID was the start of the end. She had an amazing high paying job, we loved going on holidays, planning our next adventures. She came to love working from home so when that ended and she was told to return to the office, she would have anxiety about it, so that led to her quitting work, leaving the pressure of income coming solely from me. She was looking for quick “easy” life changing ways for neither of us to work again. Unfortunately that included crypto. She kept all that information to herself so where exactly it all went nobody knows, it’s thought she was scammed multiple times, got into gambling and who knows what else. She wanted us both to take our supers out of the funds they were safely in and do Self Managed Super, which I have come to realise has all been lost. Working 34 years on both our super/retirement savings, and it’s all gone. She would never share with me the details or worries and her suicide was the biggest glimpse into what stresses she was tormented by. I had also told her I could no longer do what I was doing anymore because it was too out of control and we hadn’t been able to put any of it back.  I would have lived in a tent or a caravan with her but her dreams were so big she couldn’t live with not achieving them and I felt unlovable unless someone I loved had their dreams/goals met. I have guilt about not being more able to say no, we both need to work, plus was she trying to save one of us by leaving this life. At first her family were amazing and made sure I was respected as her partner and next of kin.  Her father had to pay for my partner’s funeral as I had/have nothing. This meant he was called to collect the ashes. They also changed when they knew of the mess we were in, like they wished she had never met me, plus hearing of  her life insurance. I was so close to them her parents, her sister plus family and now they only speak through lawyers. Lawyers they hired to fight the will. They have also held on to her ashes until I agree to certain things. They don’t like how she wanted things divided. I’m being sued civilly, plus fighting for her will and going through criminal proceedings whilst trying to grieve her loss all at the same time. I have been in and out of some mental health facilities over the past year, I can’t work and I’ve completely isolated myself from friends and life. I have been told I will be serving time. I’m in my early 50’s and never even visited a prison. I feel guilty for not giving her death my full focus to deal with the grief,  the trauma of how and why. She died I believe hoping to fix things for at least one of us but she obviously didnt know me, I only wanted her, if I had to face punishment then at least she would be there to hold me through it all. She also didn’t think her family would blame, fight or abandon me. I wonder if they would do this if we were a heterosexual couple. I don’t think she could handle the guilt of knowing there was no coming back, there was nothing left. So now I’m stuck in a place of never ending grief and no future to want to be part of. How do I process her loss, along with the loss of my dignity and morals for what I did, not to mention the guilt I carry that if I had been stronger she would still be here. I’m Waiting to be sentenced. I can’t deal with any of it and the shame I have brought my family. I miss her every second and I’m petrified and so so lonely even when others are around. I think about joining her and escaping all this pain and trauma, I find myself relentlessly searching online for information on both dealing with grief and different methods of ending my own life. I’m fixated on a “plan”, but, I need to keep thinking about how much pain losing someone from suicide is, because if I don’t then my family will join this traumatic journey nobody wants to be part of.  That is getting harder to remember the further overwhelmed I get. If only I had been stronger and said no, she would still be here. Im torn, stop my pain or save others from feeling the pain I’m now in.  Sorry for the long post, it’s a insight into my overwhelmed head;I lost my defacto partner last year 2023.

1ble9fm;My girlfriend commit suicide ;kolliedaklaw;I’m doing a copy and paste of my post in Grievesupport… this seems like a helpful community My girlfriend committed suicide Two days ago I (33m)came home from spending the evening with my daughter as I do a few days during the week because me and her mother split up and her mother works untill 10 pm… I typically come home after I put her to bed. I came home around 9pm and my girlfriend(35F) was acting abnormal and has struggle with alcoholism. I might have been in the house 20 mins or so and we started to argue .. mainly about her bizarre behavior and the fact that a knew she was intoxicated. As the argument got heated I just left the house to defuse the situation and separate myself because I didn’t want the neighbors to hear an argument and call the police. She repeatedly called me most calls I ignored and I eventually answered. She told me to come home , I refused and told her I would come home in the morning… at one point she called and said “I’m leaving for the night you can come home” I again refused. I didn’t hear from her for about a hour then she called and said “ you need to come and get your shit out of the house now, I’m done” and I replied saying I would grab my things while she’s at work the next day. She said “ no come get your things because I have your gun and I will be killing myself” I immediately called her mother, then called the police. A officer asked to meet me around the corner to explain the situation while others were with her… as soon as I met the officer he asked me maybe two questions and took off running to his car… he came back 20 mins later and told me to wait on the Sargent. Sargent came and told me she never talked to them she just walked outside and shot herself infront of them….. I’m so confused… I miss her so much… I have so much guilt….. why didn’t I answer the phone…. Why didn’t I just go to her…. Everyone keeps saying this isn’t my fault…. It was my gun she used…  she was such a bright light in my life and everyone else’s … I don’t know how I’m going to go on living without her… I want to join her….

1bldo7p;Brother gassed himself in his van…;Independent-Trip1734;LONG POSTIt’s been over a month and it’s finally just hitting me… My brother went missing less than a week before they found him. My brother struggled with mental health and unfortunately I never realized how bad it truly got. He would sometimes go MIA but he’d always show up again or text or call to let you know he was ok. The mother of his children did a missing person report and no one wanted to do an interview with the news so I chose to be that person. I did the interview and after the interview I got this feeling, my stomach was turning and I didn’t have a good feeling. Even before we got the phone call that they found him. I’d have these visions of his body and what he’d look like, I had this feeling that this time he wasn’t showing up. I knew… The police went to my grandparents house to tell them as they raised him and they were his contact. Right after my grandma called me. My spouse literally just left to get us food… so I was completely alone when I got the call. I felt like my entire world crashed at my feet, I couldn’t breathe, my chest got tight and I couldn’t stop the tears. The pain was so unreal… I’ve never felt that in my entire life. I called my spouse and he came home and took me to my grandparents house. I was the first person they called. My grandparents were very distraught. I had to make phone calls to our family to let them know, what had happened. That was very numbing. My aunty and I were left with planning the funeral and making arrangements. I had to listen to the autopsy report and give permission for my aunty to be on the call with us. His parents weren’t in his life much especially his father (he wasn’t even on his birth certificate), and my brother though older doesn’t have the right mindset to make logical decisions. So, it got left to me…The police found him in his van by the cabin that him and his friends built last summer. He had attached a hose to his exhaust pipe and ran it through his window. The only note he left was to his children. It was on a sticky note. He had sold his things and unfortunately was living in his van. The hardest part through the whole thing was trying to remain strong for everyone else and forgetting that I was grieving as well. I wrote and said the eulogy at his funeral. I just wanted him to know how truly loved his was though he didn’t feel it. Part of my feels so guilty that I wasn’t able to help him or see how much he was struggling.  I feel like I was being so selfish trying to live my life I got blinded and didn’t see what truly was in front of me. Now, that it’s done and I’m alone it’s hitting me…. I can finally grieve. I have so many questions that I know won’t be answered in this life time. I’m broken, numb and I don’t know how to feel or how not to feel at this point. I am seeing a counsellor and that helps. But, apart of me doesn’t want to acknowledge it… I feel if I don’t acknowledge it, it’s not real. Yet, I know how real it is. When I saw his lifeless body, that’s all I can think about. I can still smell him… the smell of embalming and gas is a smell you’ll never forget.;LONG POSTIt’s been over a month and it’s finally just hitting me… My brother went missing less than ;;3;26;2024-03-22 23:34:32;2024-03-22;Friday;23:34:32;3101;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:08.579227

1bkd7gh;Lost my spouse to suicide due to divorce/depression earlier this month;regina_ad_7945;"I lost my spouse to suicide earlier this month. It was a complete shock even though in hindsight I now think back if he was trying to tell me, warn me and if I could have done anything different to prevent this outcome. We were going through a divorce. I almost divorced him last year but he tried really hard to turn around and then started falling back into the same depression patterns, and I came to the conclusion in December that I couldn't keep doing this without impacting my mental health. Now in hindsight, I wish I had just made it work, and found a way to be ok. I wish now more than anything that he was still here with me. I came home to find all the lights out and found him. It was horrible. I will never get that out of my head. I can't stop thinking about how alone and how much despair he must have been in in those final moments.The first two weeks, my brain was not working right at all. I don't even know how I planned the funeral and got through it. I also finally got access to his laptop and phone and pieced together the entire timeline. He was waivering on this decision since January. His other option was to take an extended road trip. I wish he had done that. We even talked about possibly after him fixing his depression, that we could end up back together after all. He was getting help and completing treatment the week he took his life. One doctor prescribed him medications that shouldn't have been put all together and he ended up with serotonin syndrome. I've been trying to find a malpractice attorney because I'm very concerned this is what pushed him over the edge to take his life but no one wants to touch the case.I feel completely responsible for his decision as I asked for the divorce. His family says it's not my fault, and that he got tunnel vision that this was his only option to end his pain. I feel horrible. Returning to work is hard especially when people say shit like ""you'll get over it"". I will never get over this. I will always miss him.

1bk9s11;Just found out I lost him Monday;No_Secretary_6364;We had only started being romantic in January. But we seen each other so often and so much. I would sneak to his house and slide in the bed with him early in the mornings before work. Lately I had been saying I need to focus on my life and school and my kids and not see him so much. We went out Saturday had a great time. When I dropped him off he was upset he wanted to keep hanging out and I was trying to have boundaries saying I just wanted alone time. I didn’t talk to him the rest of the weekend. He killed himself Sunday night after his mom went to bed. After I found out. I opened the texts and the tik toks….. he was clearly telling me what he was about to do and I didn’t see anything. His mom snapped me on the night of his death and said she would never forgive me. I knew he was hurting. But I didn’t know it was this bad. You left me with so much grief. He put my name on his death note. You had Easter baskets for my kids in your closet. I was gonna ask u to go with us on Easter to hunt for eggs. We had plans this weekend. Everyone is pointing fingers at me. I feel so sick I feel so toxic. I’ve come to work everyday.

Throughout our bachelor's studies and the years that followed (ca 12 years now) we kept in touch and would meet up once in a while, when I went to my home country for a visit. Last time was exactly a year ago and a small group of us had such a great time. We chatted a month ago, he reacted to something I posted on instagram a week ago. I cannot believe he is gone and I feel such deep sadness for the pain he must have been in.. We found out it wasn't the first time he attempted suicide. And it left me completely broken. I think  me and my friends are all left wondering if we had reached out more, would it have helped? But we never knew how bad he was feeling.. It sucks being away from home and everyone that knew and grieves him right now. I feel guilty, because life goes on and I will be back to work tomorrow and will have to function somehow? But I also feel so much sadness and disbelief, and a part of me is just hoping it was just all a big mistake and he will soon respond to my last message?

1bjyzkw;I'm a terrible person...;98542643;"I didn't believe my ex when he made suicidal comments. I knew he was depressed but didn't even ask him what was wrong. I probably made (now in hindsight, inappropriate) jokes that may have even made him feel worse. I had found out he was trying to cheat on me 2 months prior, hence why we broke up. But I never got over him. I went back to him and even implied that I wanted to get back together. The whole time that I was seeing him after the break up when he'd make these comments, I thought he was either trying to manipulate me or pushing me away with excuses 'cause he wasn't interested in me anymore. I was so insecure after the break up and I couldn't get out of my own head. I thought between the two of us, I was the more depressed one because I was the one who was cheated on. I was always loyal and faithful to him and I cared so much for him. I didn't realize he was at such a vulnerable state. He was always so bad at expressing himself/communicating... idk if that's why I didn't bother asking what was wrong cuz I thought I knew how he'd respond (""idk"", ""nothing""). I only asked once and despite me trying multiple times for an answer, he refused to answer (and in hindsight, it seems like it's cuz he was considering suicide and didn't wanna talk about it). He was such a textbook suicide case... how could I be so dumb to not recognize it? How could I be so heartless to ignore him while he suffered? I loved him so much. I cared for him so much... I wanted to protect him like he was my son... I know it sounds weird but it isn't. He had isolated himself almost completely those last 2 months. I was the only one he saw and probably only cuz I'm pushy. I was the only one who could've helped him and instead I ignored his cries for help. Instead I was focused on my own hurt and insecurities and was actively trying to make him jealous, though I never did anything more than grab a drink with one person... but he might've thought the worst. Please. I know I'm a terrible person... and as much as I deserve it, please go easy on the criticism. I used to think I was caring, but I question my own humanity now... I'm a logical person and I know the fault is in my hands. But how am I supposed to live with this kind of guilt? I can't ever allow myself to be happy knowing how much he suffered... knowing how lonely he must've felt. The last thing I told him was that I'll always be his friend if he ever needs to talk... did he not realize how much he meant to me. Did I mean nothing to him after all.

1bjvnrs;Survivor’s Guilt?;YamPale7694;For context, my brother (23) and I (22) were severely mentally and physically abused by our mother until last summer, when we both moved out within a week of each other.  It’s been almost two months since he passed away, and I feel like it should’ve been me. I was jealous of him because he was the favourite child of my parents (yes, despite the abuse.)  They planned to have him, and I was the accident baby, born after they’d divorced. So I can’t help but feel like they wouldn’t grieve over me as much as him. But he’s the one who’s gone, not me, and I keep wondering why that is.  I feel like I’m trapped on a plane in tailspin. Ending his live was not something he hinted at when I spoke to him last. I thought he’d been doing better. But now he’ll never get the chance to heal from the horrific things we experienced in childhood.  We had always said to each other, “if you weren’t here I wouldn’t have survived”, and I only now realise how true that was. I would gladly trade my life for his, even now.

1bjqnvl;It’s been 2 months ;Good_Egg_9861;My sister was literally my only friend she was 28 I would speak to her every single day she told me all her troubles and how she couldn’t cope with the trauma of her childhood and what they did to her to ruin any chance she had as an adult I feel so guilty. She called me on the night she did it and told me she was struggling her demons always came out at night  She said she was going to call our dad after me because 111 didn’t help they would always tell her to watch YouTube. She did call him and of course he didn’t do anything. I didn’t know until the morning what happened my father said he would come get me to go see her on the day before she died because he didn’t think she was going to die he never bothered picking me up I never got to tell her I loved her. He stayed with his family that didn’t even know me or my sister instead of coming to get me with the promise he would collect me in the morning to go see her.. he never came and then he called me to tell me he was on the way to the hospital and that I need to get an Uber because she was going to die it was a 2 hour trip and she died when I was in the Uber.. I go in the hospital to say goodbye to my sisters body.. my brother was there smirking he bullied her relentlessly why was he there? To upset everyone why did they allow that? How could they be so disrespectful to her even after she’s died I wish she could’ve held on life could’ve been different I know she didn’t think she could ever feel better or ever be happy she was in and out of mental health units for years and made so many attempts her body was covered in scars and I know she’s not in pain anymore but my god I miss her so much I honestly thought she was gonna be ok. I thought everything would be different soon because we were gonna move together to Scotland and she wanted to she had hope but they always took it from her. I struggle bad and I was having some proper support finally off a sane person to help with my head and 2 weeks before my own help came for me she diedShe always said she didn’t want to die but the mental health team wouldn’t section her and wouldn’t help her and I was too far away to check on her I couldn’t drive the only reason I was so far away was because of my father my evil father.I didn’t even attend her cremation because I can’t stop this anger in my heart that my sister my kind lovely sister who wouldn’t hurt a fly who helped me cope with the abuse off our family  has died and now I have all these memories of what they did to her and me flashing back all the time. The one thing I’ve done is I’ve blocked them all out all the monsters that did this to her. I won’t smoke ever again because she was so proud of herself for quitting for a couple months. And I will get healthy because she always wanted to be but struggled with emotional eating I will get better I will get help take my pills for ptsd and I will have a life and not let these assholes in my life again and I will never let anyone treat me or anyone I love so awfully ever again.

1bjpm3i;6 months since I lost my friend;Uncle_peter21;I texted her mum today, asking if she would like to meet up so I can see my friends dog and still feel connected to her in some way. I’ve started therapy recently and am realising how much I have suppressed my grief. It will feel good to remember the love we had and keep my connection to her alive. For a long time I have been terrified of reaching out, of finding a way to sustain the connection with the friends I have lost (my first suicide bereavement was another friend in 2021). I related so deeply to my two lost girls, they saw me like no one else ever has. They made me feel beautiful and normal and celebrated. I have been scared that what happened to them will happen to me, that this is what happens to girls like us. But I know I do not want to die. I’m ready to remember the good things that remain, even now they are both gone. I can’t wait to see her mum, to catch up and to find some closure.

1bjiq01;Complicated Grief;Tiny_Replacement_653;A few years ago I lost my dad to suicide. Something I've shared with very few people is that I know the reason why he did it. On a Wednesday evening my mom (divorced from dad for decades) came over because she had something to talk to me about. That night I learned my dad had been molesting two young family members.  That moment already felt like a death. I never had any indication, never suspected anything like that. Authorities were called and reports were filed, but no one heard from him for two days. That's Saturday morning the police found him dead by hanging. Add to this I was about 4 weeks postpartum after having a daughter. My world was completely destroyed.  It felt like I lost him twice in three days...the person I thought he was, and then everything he was altogether. My grief is so complicated. I worry I shouldn't grieve him at all. I never doubted those kids, or defended him or anything of the sort, just to be very clear. He was a monster to them, so I feel relieved they are free of him. I felt relief that my daughter would never endure abuse by him. But I do still grieve the person I thought he was, the closure I'll never get, the life we could've had, the memories we made. I feel so much shame, like I should have seen it or somehow known, and like I should've called and and convinced him to face his actions, to repent and seek therapy. I feel responsible for his decision and for the loss of his life, which I know is illogical.  I feel I have to stress, I don't compare my hurt to those kids pain. It's horrific and unimaginable. In the face of that, it's hard to know what to do with my pain, and the shame and guilt I feel for carrying it. I've lost my trust in my instincts and pretty much all men. I worry about my other loved ones committing suicide because I'm not there to convince them of another way. I never read stories like mine, so it's very isolating. Anyway, thank you for listening.;A few years ago I lost my dad to suicide.

We’ll never lie in bed just talking about everything, no more heart to hearts with him, no longer have someone who genuinely made me feel beautiful.

1bitq16;Father in law killed himself.;Bbyxsadist;Hi I’m 22 F. A little over month now my boyfriend’s father killed himself. I was the one who found him in our garage when my boyfriend and I were going to do laundry. The moment I saw I pushed my boyfriend back before he could see and made him go out side. I’ve never screamed like that in my life or felt that kind of pain and I don’t even know how else to describe the other feelings. I called 911 and they asked me to go back in there and check if he was breathing. I didn’t wanna go back in but I couldn’t not do that I would hate myself if I didn’t just for that off chance he was. I can still remember that day clear as day dropping the clothes on the floor my boyfriends face when I screamed all the emotions the crying screaming shaking all of it. I remember what his dads face looked like, felt like. I saw what he used was blue he had hung himself but it didn’t click with me what it could be for a while but I couldn’t handle looking at anything that was a blue strap, I made my boyfriend throw away a blue belt he had because of it. Any ways after 2 weeks off of work I forced myself to go back, I’m a dog groomer and while at work it clicked. We use blue slip leads at work to escort the dogs around the salon. I had a bunch at our house that were easily accessible. I had to be sent home because it sent me into a panic. Everyone tried to reassure me and tell me it probably wasn’t that but sure enough on the paper work from the coroner and death certificate it says dog leash. I work with those almost everyday and it’s making me so sick and so hard to not think or see all of it over and over again. I feel so messed up in the head that I can’t get it out of my head already I have this pit in my stomach constantly because it’s always there and it randomly pops into my head and now when I go into work I see the item he used to end his life everyday all day and I can’t help but see him in the garage all over again. When does this stop? When do the thoughts go away. I feel so sick and scared because I don’t want to feel or think of it anymore. It’s making it so hard to be okay right now and making it hard to be able to stay at work. I leave work any chance I get because I don’t wanna look at the leashes. We need the money right now too especially because we moved out of the house that it happened and we are now paying more in rent. I just want it to go away.;Hi I’m 22 F.

1bipo1q;Guilt over not being at his side when life support was removed ;lauren0026;My dad died about a year ago, self inflicted gunshot wound late afternoon and he passed early morning the next day. when I got the news I immediately wanted to jump in my car and drive the 3.5 hours to the hospital but his wife wasn’t being entirely clear with what was happening and what state he was in (understandably), he was still alive and by the time my husband was able to get home and my mom was able to come over and help me contact family and make arrangements to head up there (I have three kids and one was at practice) the neurosurgeon called me after assessing him and we did an informal conference call and despite me and his wife initially saying we wanted and consented to the surgery, after speaking to the head neurosurgeon he gave it to us straight, he will die on the table trying to remove the bullet or he can pass peacefully on his own. He told me the man I knew was gone the moment it happened. So we accepted the advice and they did comfort care until he passed. This is where the overwhelming guilt comes in. I didn’t go up there to be with him and while he was dying unconscious and his wife asked if I wanted to say anything to him as she put me on speaker phone unexpectedly I said no and shut down. I didn’t want to see him like that and knew he wouldn’t want that either. But I have this overwhelming guilt now and hate that I didn’t jump in the car to get to him. It’s eating me alive. I just knew that’s how I’d remember him. He was never conscious at any point after it happened otherwise if he could speak or was aware of course I would have but I just knew when it happened that he was an empty shell and not my dad.  But damn, the thought of his wife of only a few years and her daughter who he didn’t know that well were the ones at his besdside (to which I’ll always be grateful they endured that and he had someone) gives me extreme guilt.

I used to see her every few weeks but I haven’t seen her in a few months and I haven’t been responding to her messages since I just don’t know how to respond anymore. I think it may also be the fact she treated her daughter unbelievably wrong when she was here, I really think that’s why I find it so hard to do anything with her. every time I’d come over they’d be fighting or her mom would be temporarily kicking her out which would mean we’d take her in and she’d sleep in my bed while I was upstairs. (I was only 17 at the time, 18 now.) as it’s coming to to almost a year I truly don’t even know anymore. the life when she was here feels like it never existed. It feels like some fairy tale I’ve made up in my head. I miss her so fucking much but there’s literally 0 I can do and it kills me. I talk to her brother and sister who are both a fair bit older which I’m grateful for as they’re full grown adults basically and it’s nice to have mature people I can somewhat talk to every now and again. I love her brother, I couldn’t thank the man for all he’s done for me.

1bi8fgp;Strange nightmares about my dad after a year;themildones;My dad completed suicide about 14 months ago. We had a complicated relationship. He was emotionally/verbally abusive and often physically intimidating. I have CPTSD because of my childhood, but we had a decent relationship at the time of his death.Now I'm having nightmares about him again. But this time instead of seeing him ending his life (like the nightmares right after his death, even though I didn't actually see it happen) I'm seeing him being murdered or just dying in horrific ways. In a few of them, I've killed him in self defense. I always wake up bewildered and not knowing where I am for a few seconds, because they're so vivid.Has anyone experienced this? I plan on talking to my therapist about it in 2 weeks, but in the meantime I'd love some input. I keep getting distracted at work because it's kind of hard to stop thinking about them.;My dad completed suicide about 14 months ago. We had a complicated relationship.

I was idly googling his name earlier today to see if there was an obituary or anything for him and I found a news article about his death. He was hit by a train last Tuesday and it was ruled a suicide. I don't know if he left a note or anything.I'm still having trouble believing this is real. We were close, I met him literally the day I was born and he and my aunt were like a second set of parents to me.

1bi2b1l;It’s crazy to think about how different my life would be if he were still here;ch1rpybirdy;I lost my older brother 4 years ago now and sometimes I just think about what would have changed. He never got to graduate, get his license, go to university. He never saw me graduate and he’ll never see me get married or have kids or anything like that. Every day that goes by, i’m getting older and yet he’s still the same age. Still a high schooler. When he passed, my relationship with everyone around me changed so much including my sister, my parents my friends etc.  The weirdest thing to me is how much my relationship with my parents has  “improved” since he passed. I don’t even know if I can really describe it like that because it all feels so fake. In some ways it makes me resent them because they’ve been so emotionally unavailable my whole life and then all of a sudden they’re all up into my personal life. They want to know everything that’s going on, they want me to talk to them and “be honest “ and tell them things because they hate “keeping secrets” or whatever. But it’s all lies and it’s all fake. They didn’t act this way untill my brother killed himself which made them scared of loosing me. I think they played a big role in my brother taking his life and the guilt is what’s making them want to try and be “better parents”. The thing is they don’t actually care about being better parents, they just want to feel like they are so they feel better about themselves. I hate it so much and no one understands what i mean. It’s like they want me to be grateful that they “care” now but it took them this long.I miss my brother all the time. I miss talking to him and hanging out and complaining about our parents and religion together. I miss asking him for advice about things like school and for help with my homework. I hate how when he died i suddenly had to figure out how to do everything myself. I hate having to be the oldest sister and the role model and having so much attention put on me that i’ve never had before. I hate that I have no one to talk to about this because people my age don’t understand what’s it’s like to loose a siblingI miss who i was before he passed away. I wasn’t the happiest person and i also struggled a lot with my mental health.

1bht0fs;Father's Suicide Still Haunts Me;i_am_new_s0ul;"At the age of 16 my father found out he was adopted by an abusive man my grandma was with at the time and after that my dad fell into a deep depression which made him turn to meth and a bunch of other shit to numb out the pain. 2 years later he met my mom and then a couple more my brother was born then 7 years later I was. My mom wanted to give him a family and bloodline of his own but unfortunately it didn't fill in the empty gap he had and left us for the drugs when I was 9.When I turned 19 he came back and claimed he was 10 years clean so my family and I took a chance on him and did good for a couple years then he went back to the drugs again cuz his new wife got back on them then she decided to move out of state and leave him so he came back to the town he can easily get the drugs. Anyway let's skip to the horrible night!⚠️TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️Thanksgiving 2021 I just finished eating dinner with my bf and his family, I get a call around 8pm from my sister (different dads) that a coroner came to the door and told my mom that my father committed suicide. At first I was shocked and didn't even want to believe it (shit I'm still in denial) I just kinda sat there frozen and my bf asked if I was ok cuz I kind of dropped my phone and jaw and then I told him calm and stiff that my dad is dead. The next day floats around and I'm just trying to keep it together while my family and I figure who gets to be next of Kin cuz my brother is older but he's a big baby and can't even take care of his own self so I stepped in and figure everything out. As I'm figuring it all out we find out that my father killed himself with a gun that he made himself (he wasted his talents) it was sort of like a thing where you have to pull a pin and then the back shoots the bullet (he used a shot gun bullet) thru the pipe and he of course put it in his mouth. My father Kurt Cobained himself, he did it in a tent on our favorite family camping spot.After weeks of nonsense trying to get his evil wife to sign her ""failure to act"" forms since she couldn't afford his service or cremation I was finally able to put my father to rest. The day I picked up his ashes is the day I'll NEVER FORGET because this is the day I got to smell death for the very first time from a human body..not just any human...my dad's! So when I picked up his ashes the place also said he had belongings and bags of his stuff so I was like ok I'll take them and the place even said he did have a cot but because it had his body fluids they had to burn it so I was like ok perfect.I put his belongings in the bed of my BF's truck (he took me) and did notice there was a foul smell but I figured maybe cuz my dad was homeless he didn't get to wash anything so we proceeded to drive. When I got back to my family home so we can all go thru his things together our first instinct was definitely to wear gloves and masks. As we were going thru his things we noticed his sleeping bag was in one of the big bags and we're a lil confused at this point like WAIT this had to be over or under him? Then my mom picked up the sleeping bag more and then brain matter slid out and the foul smell got thicker. My mom freaked and dropped everything and my brother and I just looked at each other until he was like go comfort mom so I ran after her while he picked our dad's things back up and tossed them in the trash.It's been 3 years and I'm still depressed about it, my brother is more affected but I can't help but think that he won't ever be here to meet his grandkids, walk me down the aisle or be there for any big milestone in mine or my kid's lives and it sucks. I had high hopes he'd clean up, I even saved money before he died so I can get him into a rehab....it was too late 😔";At the age of 16 my father found out he was adopted by an abusive man my grandma was with at the tim;;4;30;2024-03-18 15:07:52;2024-03-18;Monday;15:07:52;3743;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:10.158198

It's been a rough year. I'm trying to understand something about Mum's death. Sometime between when I saw her the night before (she lived with me) and when the police found her around midday the next day she cut all her hair off really short and I don't understand why. We didn't find any hair, so I suspect she went to a hairdresser. She had some male pattern balding and had been talking about getting a wig for the last 15 years.I understand that hair cutting can be similar to cutting, in that in can be an attempt to exercise some control - though in that case, I would have thought she would have cut it herself? I'd really appreciate any thoughts or input - although I'm a little anxious about why I suddenly need to know.

I know things hadn’t been great for him but we’d spoke about steps to sorting everything out. Coming to terms with the fact you were in that much pain mentally this felt like the only option, god I wish you’d of spoke to someone. Maybe there was a chance someone could’ve stopped this, I guess that’s just something else I need to accept I’ll never have an answer too.

I speak to your parents most days now, they’re broken. You said you wanted to reach out to your parents to try and fix things, you thought they’d just shut the door on you. I’ve spoke to them in enough depth I know I was correct when I told you they wouldn’t of done that, he said ‘would I of been happy at some of his choices? No but he’s still our son and if he told me what had happened lately I would’ve told him to come home with you and the baby so we could sort things out’ I’ve seen proof of him trying to find you and contact you but he only manages to get up to your number before you changed it in November. You were such an amazing person, I’ve never even come close to being as comfortable around someone as I was with you. I miss every part of our old life. Sometimes my brain makes me think I made you up, we never happened. Sometimes it makes me think you’ve started a new life somewhere else.

1bgsi65;20 years;Throwra_Barracuda;This year will be 20 years since my boyfriend took his own life and I figured I'd give some insight on how it feels after all these years. So first I'm sure as most of us know once we experience a partner that takes their life we are never the same again. I've lived most of these years with anxiety and fear as unfortunately this seems to have been a side effect for me smh. I always worry something bad will happen to someone and I'm always worried about if I say something wrong in an argument if something happens how much I would regret it. I moved on have had kids and sadly my kids father passed away also, but not by choice.As far as my first bf goes now that I'm older there were lots and lots of signs. He always watched gory videos and was very passionate about certain topics as well as in general an emotional person when it came to his thoughts on life. The last convo we had he was venting about work. I told him not to bring his personal thoughts on politics to work and try to just keep that to himself because he had a big falling out. I think the job let him go and I told him he'd find anther job and it would be fine. He seemed okay with the convo and calmer. Told him talk to you tomorrow and that was it. He hung him self the next day and I never got any calls that day. From what I know he got into an argument with his family that day and did it after for them to find him. It was just over..... overall the situation has made me stronger. I can handle a lot, but I tend to bottle up how I feel and sometimes wonder why this has all happened.

1bgkx1p;Nightmare ;Ok_Acanthisitta1670;Hi I'm April. It's been 6 months since i loss my significant other to mental illness. I've found a friend here who's been listening to me whenever i needed. But grief found me again. Guilt. Regret. Anger. Sadness, found me again. Even the light I've started to see becomes dim again. Now i needed to get away again. Shut the door. Isolate myself. I don't want to talk to anyone just to hear the positive side of life they say i can still have. Because i can't see that for long, it's an endless cycle of trying to see the good in life and back to darkness again. I've started dreaming of him again. At first it was 3 nights in a row. Then last night again. In my dream he was alive and i was always trying to save him. Trying to talk to him out of it. Hugging him. Crying with him. Everything i feel guilty about not being able to do when he was still here with us. In my dream he's saying he didn't die. That i am just having a nightmare. But then i woke up, and that's where the nightmare is. It is real. He's no longer here. It's like a nightmare came out of a dream and became my life, my reality.;Hi I'm April.

I always looked forward to seeing him on Fridays. Now Fridays won’t ever be the same again. I went to some of his boys scout events, I went to one of his band concerts a couple of months ago. He was at every family gathering we had. I didn’t know he was struggling.  We are 11 years apart in age. But he was my little buddy. My whole family will never be the same. I don’t know what to do now. I keep thinking about how I wish I would have seen the signs that he was hurting.

Only to be smacked in the face with the reality that I won’t ever get his approval or feedback again. Has anyone else been doing “better” only to be hit with the sobering reality that they really are permanently gone? I hadn’t been expecting to hear from him since he passed but the last few days, I keep expecting a call.

The night he took his life I was talking to him and about a fight I was in with a friend and I was telling him how I thought part of the reason she’d been so cruel to me was her husband sucked and she was jealous of our relationship. Because he was so loving and we so genuinely enjoyed each others company. When we fought we fought hard because we were stubborn as shit but there was never name calling. It was never crazy, we just would get super damn frustrated. But I always thought we loved each other. I always thought we were honest. He left me and our kids. Our kids where he kept a note on his phone so he could write down and remember all the funny things our kids said. Me- he had just gotten me flowers on our anniversary a week before with a note saying he didn’t know what the future held but he was glad it was with me. I know he was stressed about work but we had each other and two toddlers - how could he not want us and everything we had left to do in life? How could it not be enough? More than that if he was struggling with it all how could he not tell me? He didn’t even decide what he wanted for lunch without talking to me first, how could he make this huge life changing decision and not talk to me?

1bfjrnl;Did anyone else move out of your home soon after?;Gold_Bite_2237;My son (28) died on February 8, 2024. We buried him in my hometown, where my grandparents are buried and where he spent summers growing up and had lots of good memories. We currently live about 3.5 hours from there. My husband and I have been talking about moving back home for several years and before our son died, the only real reservation that I had about moving was that he would still be here alone. Now that he’s gone, I feel that moving home would help bring me some peace. I’d be close to his final resting place and near extended family. I was just wondering if anyone else had moved soon after losing your loved one? We don’t have anything tying us to where we currently are, so I’m not leaving anything behind that I feel I’ll regret later on. It feels like it’s harder to stay here among the bad memories. He didn’t live with us, but he did live about 3 miles away. I don’t even like leaving my current home because I have to drive near his home, or where I was the night I found out he died whenever I go anywhere. I’m pretty certain that moving will be far more of a help than a hindrance, but I also find comfort in hearing other’s experiences. TIA ♥️;My son (28) died on February 8, 2024.

1beirvb;Lost all my hair;BEFEMS;"HelloSince my son passed away (april last year) - I have been suffering a lot. Sometimes in silence, sometimes together with the family. My body took it really bad, my immune system is all over the place. I started to lose a bit of hair shortly after he died  and then it grew all back by September. December, the first holidays without him, I was in survival mode. So my hair decided to fall out again. And it kept falling out through January, and February. I had so many big bald patches that last week I decided to go GI Jane. I'm bald !This week I decided to see and search for all the silver linings.   Taking a shower goes quicker. I don't have hair everywhere anymore on the floor, the chair, my clothing and the shower drain. I use a drop of shampoo instead of a handful (yay for cost cutting). People are crazy friendly towards me (I think they think I have cancer). My family gifted me cute beanies and I ordered two wigs this week. The wigs are dead cheap but it will be fun to try a new style. This week I also finally went to the jewelry to create a ring with his ashes. I had postponed it so many times because I couldn't, I just couldn't. I needed time. I wanted a ring but at the same time it is just too confrontational. The jeweller was super nice, friendly, understanding. She really took the time to listen to me, asked a lot of questions. She will make a design, then show it to me and only after I'm really sure it is the design that I want, she will add his ashes to the stone. I gave her a golden ring to melt and another ring with a sapphire. She will melt the golden ring in a new design and add the sapphire. The ashes will go in the sapphire.I don't know about you, but whenever I receive mail in his name, or I have to do things for him/ about him; my stomach squeezes and I feel a little bit dizzy. I wish all of you so much support and I hope you can also see silver linings in small things. It really helps to search for silver linings, it makes me smile.Love you all !";HelloSince my son passed away (april last year) - I have been suffering a lot.

1bea71s;About the meaning and statement of their last act;TSDOP;The evening before my brother died, I unknowingly tried to convice him to not do it. He had a deterministic mindset (which I now see was probaly his depression speaking) and I'm more of an idealist. I told him that life is about everything escapes it, about the thing you can't grasp, about love. And I told him that that's why I decide to live. It sounds insane now that I write it down. I really cared for him, I tried to convince him not to do it without  knowing it. However, his final act will forever be entrenched with his being. I can't imagine his life  without his suicide. It's part of him. I see his life through that lense. I'll never romanticise suicide, I am not suicidal nor depressed. I still believe what I told him the evening before he died. But to do something like he did, to say 'fck you' to life, to instict, maybe even to  his own deterministic views on life, is something I ... respect? It takes guts to do it. He really made a statement. I wanna have the strenght it took him end his life to make this world a better place. Some people say suicide is 'weak' or 'giving up', I disagree. So as a sidenote, my therapist implied that I have difficulty seperating the political/societal act of suicide and my own personal grief. I felt like my therapist wanted me to be mad at my brother. But I am not.does anyone have similar feelings or thoughts?I'm just sharing my thoughts and feelings here btw. I truly believe in suicide prevention. I don't think suicide is good. I think we should keep fighting this sad societal system and sad situations and feelings by a radical kindness. Radically listen to someone in pain and be kind to them. I might just be a random person on the internat, but I radically care about you. I hope you know that.

1be995j;has anyone lost two siblings?;Elosa;I lost my older brother in 2020, my younger brother this past December. I have so many feelings of confusion, sadness, anger, guilt, and shock. Sometimes it doesn't feel real, other times the feelings are so intense I can barely function. I'm getting by because I have to and want to live. The thing I'm struggling with most recently is terrible anxiety, a lot about something happening to me and thinking about my parents. I just don't understand why life can be so cruel to some people, i.e. my family. I'm hoping to connect with others who understand. Thanks ♥️edit: Thank you for your replies.

I was the one who struggled. Even photos I took a couple weeks before he died (after said work event) He looks completely like himself. If someone was that distraught wouldn’t you be able to see it in their eyes? I don’t get it.

1be143u;Euthanasia?;PrettyRecklessMonkey;I lost my dad to suicide nine months ago. As so many of you would know, the roller coaster of emotions is terribly exhausting and confusing. Recently, there have been a couple of stories about people from my country seeking ways to go to countries where euthanasia is legal. Why does it feel more ‘acceptable’ for someone to opt for death if they have a terminal illness, as opposed to suicide for a different reason? I realise that saying this might be upsetting to many, but I’m asking because it is something that I find confusing in terms of how I reason about the difference between these two manners of death. It is a grey area, but having experienced this terrible kind of loss, what are your thoughts on euthanasia? I’m certainly not implying that the loss is less traumatic, but why do people generally find it more acceptable?;I lost my dad to suicide nine months ago.

My waking post-coffee thoughts told me that if he had waited a few more days he could have made his grand exit on April Fools Day. It was funny, then it felt shitty. I don't want to think about it anymore. The violence of it. I work in healthcare and he did it in front of a facility not far from my home. I'm now in a position where I'm seeking work again, and there are multiple positions open including one in the same department he was receiving care in. Again, the funnies creep in. I'd actually like that job, I'd really like to work in that facility in fact. Close to home, well run, interesting subspecialties to work in. But that sounds like a dumb move. I alternate between thinking it probably doesn't matter to ‘What the hell is wrong with you?’ (me) Why did he have to do it there? I think, why couldn't he have done it another way?

When I first walked in the room I thought he was asleep on the bed, but quickly realized he’d shot himself. It was gruesome and bloody and traumatic as fuck. Now, I absolutely DREAD waking people up. My rational brain knows they aren’t dead. It knows their faces are whole, clean and normal, but I cannot shake the nauseating, primal fear in the back of my head that I’ll see what I saw when my dad died. Two of my kids are still young enough to need help getting moving in the mornings. My husband has a sleep disorder that makes waking up difficult, so most days I’m waking three people.  I dread opening their doors and touching their shoulders. I refuse to look at their faces, and stare past them at the walls. It makes me sad because my youngest noticed our morning routine isn’t the same. I don’t tickle her back and sing while I brush the hair off her face anymore. I made a conscious effort to try and wound up leaving the room sobbing which is confusing and unfair to her obviously.

She had a drinking problem but her suicide was still somewhat unexpected and the entanglements dealing with her husband and my narcissist grandma following it have been somewhat of a distraction.Now it seems like that’s coming to a head. He finally sent the ashes and our family photos (my dad died when I was 10 from drinking related illness… his family stopped talking to us then..: these sentimentals she had are my sister and I’s main childhood momentos)We battled to get these items (I guess he wrote us out of their trust right away) and I’m grateful he’s sending those and the ashes because they mean so much. But now that it’s really happening…I feel like water is building against a dam.I have to hold her ashes.

1bc6v6s;3 years today. ;Latter-Report-8162;3 years ago today I woke up crying my eyes out, feeling like i was in the most horrific mental state. Took the kids to school, dropped in my mums for a cuppa and to say how I was feeling.. I told her it didn’t feel like it was my pain I was crying over. Called the doctor and went to see the mental health team at 9.30 as I honestly thought I needed to be sectioned. 12.30 all this pain and tears stopped. 1pm I popped to the shops to get food ready for after school.. 1.30pm my phone rings and my mum tells me my little brother is dead. I can still hear my screams, the man in the car next to me looking  at me like I was a crazy lady…the call I made to my partner and best friend, the drive to my mums house, walking in and seeing her there screaming and crying. 3 years ago today, my little brother left this world by his own hand. His own choice. 30 years of age. We had a horrible childhood, he became an alcoholic and in his later years an addict. It was all just too much for him. Little bro, I miss you so much. I would do anything to have you back here, but that’s selfish. It means you would still be in pain. I hope you found your peace wherever you are. Your absence is so loud it’s painful. Forever 30, forever my baby bro. See you when I get there kiddo, il meet you at those pearly gates 💙🩵🤍;3 years ago today I woke up crying my eyes out, feeling like i was in the most horrific mental state;;5;27;2024-03-11 16:10:25;2024-03-11;Monday;16:10:25;1306;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:10.283112

1bbx6zg;My mum left a suicide note and the paramedic told us not to read it, is this normal?;Overall-Wear-7188;My Mum passed away and left a note, the ambulance medic read it and said their guidance is for family not to read suicide notes left because it isn't the person they were when they wrote it and we should remember Mum how she was. Is this normal? I have the feeling he has suggested this because the note is not kind and potentially blames us for the reason she took her life. The note will not be released to us for another while as it is part of the post mortem and cornorers investigation. It feels really strange not to read something she left. She has struggled a lot in the past few years with mental health and her relationship with us all became incredibly challenging and hard to manage and the guilt is insurmountable with how it has ended.

It has been so hard. No one knew he was struggling, he seemed so happy. I keep thinking about how I could have saved him if he would have reached out to me the night he killed himself. I wish I would have talked to him and asked him if he was okay the last time I saw him. Now that I think of it there were signs. He use to be so talkative and hyper but the past couple of years he has been very quiet and he isolated himself a lot. But I didn’t think anything of it because that’s what kids his age do. That’s how I was when I was his age. I thought he was just really interested in his phone and video games. I just wish he was still alive. Me and my whole family are completely devastated. He was a big part of our lives and our lives will never be the same without him.

She only got sober 8 years ago but was so volatile…as I entered recovery I distanced myself more and more. I didn’t see her for nearly 15 years, she never visited me when I was in care. She was too unwell… The last year of her life I hardly spoke to her, I have so many messages and she tried so hard to reconnect… so so hard and I just blanked her. We had some really special moments too but  I’m just really struggling with the grief, mourning not only her but the life she could of had and also the life my sisters and I could of also had. We are all doing so well but it’s just hard to have to see my peers having kids, buying houses & having a happy family. I’m trying not to pathologise my current experience but having been in therapy and seeing psychiatrists for so long it is hard for it to not feel like something is wrong with me… that i need fixing and NOW!

1bbmyjp;I’ve been thinking my friend who committed ;No_Force_4085;I don’t know how to start this, or even express what I’m feeling. I just need to write it down and say something to anyone or even into the endless void that the internet is. My best friend that I had known my whole life, was 16. committed on the 16th of February this year, 3 days before my cat died on the 19th of February, and on the 27th is my birthday. The day before he passed he told me he attempted, I was getting ready for school (which is a feat in its own), when I checked Snapchat as my morning routine, I opened his snap reading “I tried to hang myself 💀”I’ll admit, I didn’t do a good job at comforting him, and I regret it deeply now. I regret not telling anyone what he told me. But nonetheless I did a shitty “are you okay? Are you safe? You’re not going to try again, right?” I regret not being there for him. For trying to do something to actually help himI go on with my day after texting him for 15 minutes about random stuff.The next day I had sent him a snap and he hadn’t replied, which wasn’t unusual for him to do so. So I sent another snap, which also went unanswered. So I kinda just forgot about it. Later that night, it was 8pm when a family friend I also have on Snapchat sent me their streaks, saying “rip (my best friend’s name) you will be missed” and I was shocked, but I didn’t want to freak myself out, but since his name wasn’t common and from what he told me the day prior, and him not answering me I was getting very worried, so I snapped my family friend.They ask me if they can call me to talk, and they call me and go on to tell me about them and then I really start to freak out. I sat on my bed in the dark for 15 seconds deciding if I should run to my mothers and fathers room to tell them about my best friend, who’s known his family longer then me and him being friends. I ran to them and tell them what happened and how I found out. I attended his funeral on the 6th of March, it didn’t even feel real. It didn’t feel like what was happening was happening, the funeral lasted an hour and it went by so quickly. I was there and then I was home again. He hung himself, and I can’t get the image of him struggling out of my head. I keep thinking about it and it’s making me feel terrible. I keep thinking about how he tried it once and then did it again. I keep thinking about it and it’s making me feel fucking like a disgusting animal for not doing something to help him.He was only 16, he had so much to live for. I keep thinking about the things he’ll miss out on, the experiences he’ll never get. It’s driving me insane that I couldn’t help someone who is now gone forever.Rest in love Ken, I’m sorry I failed you.;I don’t know how to start this, or even express what I’m feeling.

I didn’t message or call and now he is FUCKING DEAD!! I was over there within minutes while the paramedics worked on him but it was too late. I hugged his lifeless body to say goodbye and walked with him while they wheeled him on the trolley into the coroner’s van as I didn’t want him to feel alone.

1bawx3j;My Dad has become my best friend since he passed;Butcht4t;It’s so strange. I always deeply loved my father, but we were pretty distant when he passed. I lived in a different state, but even before that we were growing apart. I texted / called him about once to twice a week telling him I missed and loved him, updating him on my life. I saw him about three to four times a year in person, I wish to god I had seen him more. It was just hard with his alcoholism and my own stupid issues. I saw him the night he died, he did it about an hour after I left his house. I forgot to hug him goodbye. This haunts me and always, always will.So I couldn’t say with earnestness that he was my best friend. But I feel it now. I think about him every day, countless times a day. I talk about him often in conversations with friends and strangers alike. Good food, art, and music reminds me of him more often than not. I read books and watch videos about the choices he made. I often worry what other people think of him. I think about what he would like and what I wish we could do together. I look back on the immense love he had for me and I weep for him out of love and compassion and empathy for his hurt.

1ba4yhm;I'm afraid of people;tofu-tofuest;"Horribly so. To a, frankly, ridiculous extent.I know my parents worry about me being lonely. And I am lonely, it's true. And it sucks. But people are just so scary.During the early days so many terrible things happened because ""hurt people hurt people"" and I just zoned-out and drifted through all interactions. I didn't really feel the fear until very recently, and I want to know if someone has gone through something similar?I lost my person 2 years ago. And (somehow) I finished college a year ago. When I finished the term, I felt relief because I wouldn't have to keep going to school and putting on social masks.I tried having an in-person job at first and the panic nearly destroyed me. It didn't last long, I quit in a panic. I ended up looking for only remote jobs after that one because the thought was less terrifying than having to actually go to an office.I don't really have many friends in this city. And the ones I have... It's gotten to the point in which the idea of going out to see them scares me so much that I tend to pretend to be sick or out of town.So, my old friends and acquaintances make me nauseous. Seeing them and thinking about them makes me feel like I'm back in the early days of losing her, when there was harassment going strong. It makes me feel like I'm going to have the rug pulled from under me any second.Hanging out with new people, even in just a professional level, makes me want to cry. I can't make any new good friends because I can't keep up with texting and I always end up backing out of plans. Probably because of the abandonment issues that stem from suicide?I had to quit all social media. I couldn't do it anymore. I felt like I couldn't escape the fight-or-flight response that being in contact with people was causing me to have.If I'm out without my dog, I don't last very long.And it is usually fine. I don't mind staying home. I have my dog here and he's great! I am kind of functional here. I can be kind of functional as long as I am pretending that the world doesn't exist. I can clean, finish my tasks, make sure we're well fed, listen to music, go on walks... But the moment I think of people, I become paralyzed by fear; can't do anything anymore except just lay on my bed and wait for the panic and pain to pass.But I know this can't go on forever. And that thought alone makes me want to disappear. Because the truth is that, while I am lonely, there is more peace in this loneliness than in facing everyone when the one person who used to have my back is no longer alive.";Horribly so.

I’m having a hard time dealing with it bc I feel so guilty and like it’s completely my fault. He told me I broke his heart and he can’t lose me. He had been depressed since I knew him and always talking about hurting himself. I didn’t mean to hurt him or break his heart. Things with us just never seemed to work out and it would never be the relationship I needed and wanted. His mental health was also always bringing me down as well. But i couldn't make him see that or understand. When I ended thing he told me to never contact him again and blocked me on everything. He sent me a message on Saturday saying he didn't understand. I never replied back bc i didnt want to get into an argument and i thought it would be best to just not reply. Well he messaged me also on tiktok but I didnt see it until Tuesday it said I can’t lose you. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away on Monday. Now I’m here wondering if I would have replied would he still be here?! Was this all my fault?! The guilt is literally eating me alive I haven’t stopped crying and going over the what ifs. I will always love him. I never meant for any of this to happen. I never meant to hurt him but I just couldn’t be with him how he wanted. He was my biggest cheerleader and the one to wipe away my tears several times. It kills me that I wasn’t there to help him that I caused him so much heartbreak and pain. I feel like the worst person in the world. I did however find out that he was apparently engaged to someone else so that also sent me for a loop.

1b99g5m;This grief is just so different;OkBalance2833;I was speaking to his dad earlier and got asked if this is my first time with grief and I got thinking.I was 17 when I lost my mum, watched her get sicker over years then realllllllllly sick in a couple months. Nothing could be done, you’d think that would traumatise me the most right? She was my only real family member. I’m not saying it didn’t affect me and I wish she was here and healthy but honestly I was told from young I’d be lucky to see her live past me turning 12 so 17 was good. She was in a LOT of pain and couldn’t move, it wasn’t exactly life she was living. I know I sound heartless, believe me I do love and miss her but her death was completely explainable. This happened which meant x happened which meant x happened which meant death. This though, he was 29. Went to the gym, worked hard, went out with friends, hands on dad. Once we got the addiction stuff sorted he really could’ve gone far. I don’t know what would’ve happened with us, maybe we would’ve completely sorted things out and got married, had more kids. I fell pregnant back in July, I would’ve been due the week of our sons 1st birthday. Unfortunately we lost them but he was so happy and that’s when I saw the determination to fix everything in him. We went back up and down after the loss. Maybe we would’ve split up for good not just 3 weeks here(this is where we were when he died but still mainly living with eachother, you wouldn’t think we’d split again) 2 weeks there , maybe got with other people and coparented. Who knows, I doubt we would’ve split for good, even your dad said he thinks we would’ve lived a happy life together once everything was sorted but maybe it could’ve. I’ll never know now though, we would’ve always stayed friends at least. There genuinely wasn’t anything that we couldn’t of sorted, I’ve thought of it all. He should still be here, only 29. I’ve made fun of him for years he was turning 30 and now he won’t? There’s no explaining this type of death where I’ll understand.

He was on the verge of losing his house and going to jail and so I finally went off on him and boom same day I sent that text he fucking kills himself???

And the ONE TIME I give him some tough love he fucking hangs himself. I have no idea how to feel. Some days I miss him but then I remember how fucked up all of this is. Some days I feel guilty and other days I feel like I was too nice to him for too long. I feel so confused all the time and I absolutely hate it.

I know it’s selfish of me to mind, but beyond sending me the date of the service, his family has chosen not to communicate with me. I reached out a couple times and was ignored.

1b881ks;Betrayal;PrettyRecklessMonkey;"I lost my dad to suicide nine months ago today. My mom recently decided to sell the house since it is too large for her alone, and the time it takes to maintain it is insane. My mom is incredibly driven and my dad was the stable force that grounded her. She is the strongest woman I know. And while she is not making rash decisions, and she is rational about the future, she is falling apart, and I have no idea how to support her. I have one sibling who stays much closer to my mom than I do. We try to be there for her as much as we can, but we have our own lives that do not stand still. How can I support my mom if I can barely process that this has actually happened? As it does most of the time with suicide, this hit us out of nowhere. My dad had no (obvious) history or sign of mental illness. In his own quiet way, he was the rock of our family. My mom and I have at times had a strained relationship, and she has always been closer to my sibling. My dad and I are very alike, and got along so well. His death felt like such a betrayal. He left us. He left me. He was my ally and he left me. He has left my mom with an immeasurable amount of guilt and doubt. Questioning whether their marriage was as good as she (and frankly, everyone around them) thought it was. I resent him for it. I cannot look at pictures of him. Every single day I think of the violent way a gentle man ended his life. Without any warning. I will never hear his voice again; never make him laugh. Never hug him again. He will not walk me down the aisle at my wedding in a few months. And I miss him so much. I don’t know how not to have a dad.";I lost my dad to suicide nine months ago today.

1b86985;Do you ever stop feeling guilty?;CuriousCat813;I lost my only teen daughter to suicide 4 months ago. We were best friends, we were always together, we talked a ton, I was ever present in all her activities, knew all of her friends etc. I started her in therapy because she said she needed. I knew she was having anxiety issues and sleeping problems. But because the rest of her life was seemingly normal and I just had no understanding that it was possible to have super high-functional depression, I failed to see red flags and thought they were part of being a teen because I too was that way (procrastinated, had very few close friends, did not feel part of a friend group etc). Not being able to see these red flags, not starting her in therapy earlier, not being super patient when she was procrastinating also because I was too overwhelmed with having lost my Dad 1.5 months before and the list goes on. I do see a therapist, I do work actively not to think those thoughts because I know they are not productive and I don’t like to stay in suffering. My therapist have told me I am excessively hard on myself (funny I told this to my daughter all the time).

I can’t really explain it, but it literally seems like yesterday it happened however, it’s been a year anyway, I could use all the love and hugs I can get.;Tomorrow marks a year since I found my wife of 25 years dead in our house.

1b7lw7u;Will I ever be normal in a sustained way?;WorldlyAd8726;I just went to an event for my children where I think I didn’t think of my suicide victim for 3 hours. I’m pretty sure that’s the longest I’ve gone since it happened three months ago. I think of them all day long at work and so on. I’m often doing other things, but everything‘s in context of, oh, that couple holding hands really reminds me of the life he could’ve had, etc. The fact that it was even possible to forget for three hours was amazing to me. I thought maybe I would never be a regular person again.Now that I’ve seen that I can have the capability to be normal, it makes me wonder how I can go about achieving that state more often. I know it would be better for my children. Do I have to let him go? Do I have to stop talking to him whenever I’m driving in the car alone? Do I have to accept this world without him in it as being a real world? Previously, I thought that his death meant that there was no sense in the world, and that I could never make sense of or find meaning in anything. If that is what I’m supposed to do, accept this world, I don’t know how to go about doing it. Today it just happened by accident , so I guess maybe it will happen again. I had every intention of experiencing this event today like I have ever every other one since he left, with every moment being an agony, just serving my sentence, so I can fulfill my commitment of staying alive for my children. The concept of actually having a life is a new one for me in this new world.;I just went to an event for my children where I think I didn’t think of my suicide victim for 3 hour;;7;14;2024-03-06 00:42:44;2024-03-06;Wednesday;00:42:44;1480;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:11.650499

You don’t just feel the disbelief, fear, numbness, anger, sadness at various moments. You feel all of them at the same time. And this feeling of never having joy ever again. After the initial shock that was the hardest thing I dealt with, I’m finding it easier to engage with people. I even ‘forget’ for a few minutes. But the joy? The excitement for life?

1b6ymn1;My twin was about to graduate;hecalledmecasper;"It's been a few months since I found him smiling peacefully in his bed.I struggle where to start. We had our whole lives to live, and I have looked as far back as when we were children. Our parents fought frequently, as a baby I would often be awaken by the sound of objects thrown around the room and my mother's yelling. She was always complaining about our father's alleged affairs. On ""good days"" we were a loving family, but ""on occasion"" these things happen and everyone including us were collateral damage.Still, kuya and I spent a great chunk of our memories living around such cycles of love and violence to the point that I would cry as soon as I hear someone speak loudly towards me. But he was the opposite, he would hug me as soon as I meltdown. Then stood up for me and helped people understand I grew traumatized by loud voices. Growing up around him felt safe. He always seemed mature, and I admittedly became dependent. He had the grace to communicate with people while I struggled to approach anyone else but him and a few precious friends. At school he always does his best. Back when we still went to the same class he was everyone's favorite and I am proud to see him shine. People would often compare us but I don't mind being average. Our parents were our biggest supporters. Despite their ""occassional"" ""differences"" they were always able to provide for us. Never pushing us to do better, nor compare us. During senior high kuya was able to do so well with his college applications he managed to get an interview slot for this accelerated program in medicine. I was so happy for him. He always wanted to be a doctor and this application was the closest he got to realize his dreams. But it was right around those months when the rumors about our father started to spread like wildfire. The family was in disarray. Due to his affair father was rebuked of his license and got fired from his job. By then he left the house, and we never heard of him until a few months later.Father was responsible for a substantial amount of the family's finances that the loss of his job significantly affected. So much so that one day Mom didn't have a choice but to talk kuya out of his application. I could hear the pain in her voice when she softly spoke about why she couldn't buy him a plane ticket to Luzon let alone an allowance for his cost of living there until the interview, or the tuition fees that she had to cover alone even if he was able to apply for a scholarship. Kuya tried his best to convince her, it was the first I heard him shouted. But I could hear from his voice his desperation and surrender. After that exchange he knocked on my door fully aware that I was rattled by his outburst. As soon as I opened the door he let off an apologetic smile, said sorry that I had to hear that. I could have told him he didn't have to apologize. I wasn't crying because of trauma, I was crying because I he was still able to smile.Months flew past, our father at some point came back and reconciled with mom. But things were different, there was tension now. Kuya often looked to me as if asking for support coz he could no longer talk to both of them. Suddenly I was I was the glue that held the family together. Our parents, though physically together had hearts miles apart. I could tell from them both that they were guilty of my brother who was gradually drifting away. My only strength was our sister who was still a baby and ignorant of the family's problem.We graduated senior high. Kuya and I enrolled into the same university. We both took pre-med but our courses were different. Mom provided for the both of us because father's new salary as an assistant in the markets didn't help too much. Luckily it was right around the pandemic when our tuitions were significantly lower because of online modalities that were implemented. Christmas came and just when kuya has gradually adapted, felt better, and started to communicate with us again mom suddenly found out that father was still cheating. We were powerless from the events that happened after, the family broke apart. Mom took me and my sister back to her hometown while kuya deliberately chose to stay with our father and lola.In the two years that passed, kuya and I grew apart. While I kept trying to reach him out none of us were able to get as much of a call back from us or a message. On those years I missed him so much. I couldn't wait to reconnect with him again, told him about all the antics I did with our sister in all this time that passed.Valentines came one time and father and kuya finally visited us in our mom's hometown. While father tried to reconcile with mom I was stunned at the sight of my own twin again after so long. For a moment his face was frozen, his eyes were devoid of the brightness it once had, his smile was like a lifeless crack on his face. I could tell he was happy, that he was trying his best to smile. That he was trying his best to look the part but I just knew he's been through hell. But it changed as if he was finally able to force that feeling out of him. He hugged me, and our sister like he always had. And give us a bright and radiant smile. The same one that gave me courage. We gradually talked about the past two years we haven't seen each other. Though it was honestly mostly him listening to me. He opened up about a few things but I was somehow too afraid to ask him about his radio silence. I remember he said something about being happy seeing us happy here. That night we felt like a family again, it wasn't as perfect but we gradually mended one crack at a time. We lived together back at home again and face to face classes eventually became a thing. Kuya and I moved out and lived in the same apartment. We were able to reconnect as brothers struggling to live. It was funny how we were both clueless about cooking neither of us apparently learned any helpful skill in the years we lived apart.I was happy he was able to find new friends tho, and he was pretty excited about finally being able to meet them in person. He tries to hide it but a twin can tell. A schoolyear passed, and he was finally able to enter his graduating year. That time he was an intern, and he seemed always happy talking about the fun things he did. He started to review for his licensure exams, and as always, he was always getting good marks. He was able to do well, and excel until he assured his graduation. In a word, he didn't struggle. No one could tell, not even me, that he already had a plan. We were pretty excited about it too. The night before our graduation we talked about a lot of things. The girls she liked, the girls I liked. The one we hopelessly pursued. We just a twin of hopeless romantics. But just before I went to bed he told me the exact same thing, he was so happy our sister and I were able to live a good life. Everyone thought it was because of his forfeited dream course application, some thought it was because of our father's antics. A few passersby jokingly speculated whether he was busted by a girl but I only glared at them for disrespecting him.But I knew. I could tell. I was the only person who lived with him long enough to tell that he wouldn't do it because of any of those reasons but because of all of it and everything in between. My brother was strong, and graceful. He was kind, and loving. He cared about me for a good chunk of his life until our sister came and I depended on him through all of it. I shouldn't have. I was his twin, I was born to share his burdens, I should have gone through the shits he faced and not have him defend me from it. I could have saved him. I didn't need signs, I didn't need him to call out to me for help. I could have made his life more bearable back when were still so young. The more I look back through it all the gradually I realize. He didn't just stand up for me whenever I was being yelled at. I wasn't the only one who was traumatized at the sound of people arguing. He cried through it too. He was just protecting himself while seeking support from me the way he hugs. He didn't just do his best to excel academically, he did it so he could help ourselves study. He wasn't depressed about not being able to take his dream course, he was mad at himself for not being able to stop the turmoils that led to our family's downfall. When I saw him for the first time after so long, I could immediately tell he went through hell. Because he wasn't given much of a choice to leave the house and risk losing our father altogether. It just didn't make sense. He hated him the most. He had all the more reason why he should have left with mom while I could have chosen to stay. All we needed was one child in his custody so he would be legally obligated to ""provide"" for his children — which was the least he could do. But I couldn't see through even that, so he sacrificed himself through all of it.It was absurd when I thought I was left to fill his role of keeping the family together, what I did wasn't nearly enough as his sacrifices. I should have been able to see through his weaknesses as much as he could see mine. It hurts to realize that all he wanted, after giving up on his dreams was for me to be happy. Months have passed and I still about him smiling. Everyday I try to do my best, to live on in his stead but everyday I feel so much weaker after every time I rediscovered his strength. And all I could ever feel was miss him, and remember his life.";It's been a few months since I found him smiling peacefully in his bed.I struggle where to start.

1b6lzfb;Guilt;Cool-Salary7522;Does the guilt factor ever get better? It’s been 2.5 months since my boyfriend took his life. It was during an argument and I was trying to leave the situation just for a breather and he did it while my back was turned. We both exchanged some words we would regret but we have argued about worse for longer amounts of time, and it absolutely kills me that this was our last interaction. He is the love of my life, I’ve known him 10 years and been with him for 8+ of that time. I’m pregnant with our child, and I know it was impulsive and if he had another moment to think he would still be here. He had threatened suicide before but it was always more of a means of manipulation in the moment, and almost always involved alcohol or substances. He dealt with alcoholism on and off since I’ve met him but had been basically sober minus a few slip ups for the last 2-3 months. He also had just gotten a new job that he was set to start the week after he died. I wish I took it more seriously those times, made him sell his guns, anythjng to prevent what happened. I still am feeling lost and like my life is a simulation. I somehow have to be a parent now and I don’t know how to do this. On top of the guilt for that particular night, I also feel so wrong living a life he was so excited and proud to be part of.He told me countless times I saved him, that he wouldn’t be here without me. I think that weighs on me a lot too, because why was this time different?;Does the guilt factor ever get better? It’s been 2.5 months since my boyfriend took his life.

1b6herh;I blame his ex, but I feel terrible for doing so. It's unfair and awful and the whole situation hurts so much;akjfsskfasfgfk;"One of my best friends in the world died last Wednesday. He was only 31. I'd known him for years. I don't have a great deal of friends, so I treasure those who are close to me, and he was really one of the best -- such a warm, funny, sweet guy. If I'm grateful for one thing, it's that I hugged him goodbye every time we met up and I told him often how much I cared about him and was proud of him. He'd had such a hard few years. His wife (childhood sweethearts since they were 16) had moved overseas to study and their relationship had slowly eroded for many reasons until they had a very painful, messy breakup and subsequent divorce. I was there to see the fallout and he was never quite the same afterwards. As if things weren't hard enough already, he found out he had aggressive leukaemia barely two weeks later. He spent a year in the hospital undergoing intensive chemo, then another year on a maintenance dose. The day he messaged me to say he was cancer-free I was so happy and proud and thrilled for him. It kills me to know that was only four months ago. After his divorce his wife gradually stopped talking to him until she basically ghosted him, and that, along with the cancer, seemed to make him very anxious ever since about being ghosted again. He wound up meeting this girl we both knew, someone who was nice but much younger than him and who seemed immature to me. Over the space of a year they became good friends, started dating, then broke up. I don't think I'll ever know why, but after their breakup she, too, started becoming distant and eventually began ignoring most of his messages. I spent a lot of time with him talking about this because he was so upset, and I guess I could say I blame myself for not recognising the signs sooner, but the thing that hurts most is there really...weren't any signs. A week ago he mentioned he'd had a ""near-suicidal breakdown"", but he was lucid and talked about booking therapy, said he was just going to move on, he was living with family who looked after him and cared for him a lot, etc. He seemed depressed but never so bad that I was really worried. I guess this is why I blame her -- I don't want to, I know it's no one's fault, but still. There's this awful part of me that can't stop thinking, if they'd never dated, if she'd never ghosted him and ignored him when he was clearly in such a vulnerable mental state, my friend might still be alive. And that thought absolutely breaks me. There's been an enormous outpouring of sympathy for her and his family and friends and I can't stop thinking about how much I resent her and how badly I want my friend back.";One of my best friends in the world died last Wednesday.

1b6a3pn;On this day, last year, you chose to leave.;endofmyrainbow;"I didn't get a chance to ask you to stay.Things were changing but I didn't realize I wouldn't see you anymore. When we hugged for the last time I felt this deep sadness. It terrified me. That hug felt so final. I thought about it for months after. I broke down when a close friend asked me what was wrong last January. I couldn't shake that feeling. I should have called you. I should have told you I was worried. In your head, there was war.A daily battle that slowly tore you apart.Your whole face smiled,But I saw the pain in your eyes.We always had a mutual respect and unspoken understanding of each other's ups and downs. Being friends since high school we had a lot of time to witness each other grow up, but we also had to watch each other struggle. Neither of us wanted to dive deeper into that pain. So we tried to make each other happy. We had a silent acknowledgment of similar sad feelings and dark places in our minds. You would always come and find me at parties to check in. You being the ultimate host with the most social butterfly, me usually anxious, awkward, and uncomfortable. You always made a point to seek me out, check on me, and make sure I was having a good time too. Thank you for that. I knew you were hurting but I never realized how scared and desperate you must have felt. Still, you trudged through. Only now do we understand how hard you were fighting to stay in this world.It's been a year now since you've been gone... A year of tears, of grief, of unending heartbreak. A year of mourning. We have cried an ocean of tears for you since you left us. With your peace, our pain began. In the dead of night, a moment in this world, and you were gone. I wonder what you felt on your last day here. This day, last year. Were you afraid? Was there anything we could have said or done to make you want to stay?Your soul is free now, but there is so much here you are missing. There was so much left to say. Your death tore me apart. I wish every day that you could still be here with us.   Our last 10 years of our friendship came with many scary times that bonded us closer together. I was there for several seizures you had while working, including the first one. Friday, April 29th, 2016. I'll never forget the helpless feeling we all had watching this happen for the first time. Matty and I did all we could do. We scrambled to try and remember all the things they told us to do in 1st aid training. We made sure you were on your side, we protected your head with lots of towels, and we waited. When you came back I was the 1st person you saw. You tried to sit up. You were confused so I just tried to keep you talking. I was so relieved to see you come back to us. I had never seen anyone have a seizure before. I don't think any of us had. We were all terrified and very much scarred by what we had just witnessed. The paramedics were asking you questions ""What's your name?"" ""Do you know where you are?"" And you answered them correctly. When they asked: ""How old are you?"" You said, ""25."" (you were 30) I texted you that night to see if you were ok. You apologized for scaring us. You thanked me for being there with you. We told each other I love you, and then we started joking around to ease the seriousness of the situation. This is when I started calling you ""Time Traveler""  In the years that followed, I watched you push to live life to the fullest. But that commitment to keeping the party going came with a high price. Eventually, I saw a truth that I couldn't bear to face. I was so scared that one day you would have a seizure and not wake up. I talked a lot about what we should do or could do to help you, and what would happen if this continued. Eventually, we all realized that we couldn't force you to do anything you didn't want to do. You had to want it for yourself. I compared you to an ember, burning hotter and hotter. We tried to regulate the fire, but it started to get out of control. It hurt me so badly but I had to step back. I know you wanted things to be better and that you hated that we were talking about you behind your back. It was from a place of deep love and fear for your safety. I hope you understand that now.You were destined to be here for a good time and not a long one. I've spent many days this past year endlessly scrolling this subreddit (so thankful to have found this space) I had so many questions when you decided to go.  We started learning more about epilepsy and the lasting effects it had on your body and your mind. We started reading and researching CTE. There was so much to learn after you left. I wish we could have talked about these things together while you were still here. I'm sorry that I misunderstood what was happening in your head. I'm so sorry I thought I had to step away from our friendship. When you started to say things like ""I won't be here"" I got so mad. I knew deep down that what you said was a fact. I didn't want to believe it. I looked deep into your eyes and told you never to say that shit to me again and I regret that now. You were trying to tell me something and I shut you down. It never crossed my mind that you would be the one to say when it was time for you to go. Honestly, I had to start mourning your inevitable death a few years ago. Deep down in my soul, I knew you wouldn't make it into our 50’s. Kick and stretch! We always talked about staying friends as we grew older and older. I've always loved you and our friendship, I know you know that. We said it every time we saw each other. I miss reminiscing with you about how much fun we had. The good times. The bad times. Making each other laugh...Since you've been gone we've tried to live a little more. We started kayaking last spring. I wish you were here so I could tell you how much fun we have!  How peaceful and beautiful it is to float and explore. We started hiking and found some amazing secret spots. We treat ourselves in your memory. I know you would have been so excited for us. One day with the sun shining down brightly, I felt your presence as I walked through the woods. I held out my hand for you to hold, and for a moment we were together again.

1b5ulay;Hi everyone;Sea-Store-5326;My husband’s best friend killed himself last Saturday and we just found out about it Thursday. I need advice. So my husband went to his house yesterday to hangout with his roommate and ask if I could stay home ( I really wanted to go because I considered him to be family but I stayed home to respect his wishes). Since we found out he’s been a little harsh towards me. I understand he’s grieving but I’m grieving too. I try to be strong for him but I just can’t take the grief and cruelty at the same time. This is the first time I’ve lost a loved one to suicide and it hurts so bad. He was supposed to be the “funcle” to our future kids. I’m just hurt by everything. I can’t imagine how much pain he was going through to end it. I can’t even see him not being in our lives anymore. He was more than a best friend he was family.;My husband’s best friend killed himself last Saturday and we just found out about it Thursday.

1b5pwpo;I woke up, and for a brief moment, it was all a dream.;brianabird;"I had a dream that one of my nieces was holding up a piece of pizza for me to heat up in the microwave. After I get it out and blow on it a bit to make sure it was cool enough for her to eat, she said, ""Thank you Auntie. I needed somebody to do that because  Daddy's is dead and in heaven now."" And she just started crying so hard. I scooped her up and she just laid on me, crying into my shoulder and saying ""I want God to give my daddy back""I stood there, lip trembling, esophagus swelling, gut tensing as I tried to hold in my own sobs.That's when I woke up, and had that wash of ""Oh, thank GOD that wasn't real"" relief one has after a dream. I've just been staring at the ceiling since then. It's like I'm trying to convince myself that if I stay in bed, it really was a dream and my brother will text me, saying ""Hey, could you get the girls up for school on Tuesday? I have a doctor's appointment.""But it won't happen. This is reality. My little brother is dead. I have work in a few hours. My little brother is dead. My friend recommended an anime for me to watch.

1b5kpil;10 months after original post(loss of dad);ThatGeeMental;"(Original post).                               -Update on bottom-I've never done this before but I for some reason had a feeling to try so here I go. It's been almost 7 months since I lost my Dad to suicide. I have flashbacks constantly of that day and it's as violent as the day it happened. I still hear him yelling at me to get away. I still hear the bang. I blame myself still for not making it to that restroom in time. I just needed 10 more seconds. People tell me ""Then what would've happened if you did? You don't know if he would've."" I don't know what would've happened but I know it'd be better than this. I am still struggling with this situation badly. Nobody is understanding me my mental has significantly decreased dramatically. I already deal with depression every single day even before that day. I have my own family and I feel bad due to the fact that I feel stagnant in the way I feel. Lack of motivation even though I have my daughter. I'm so lost in pain. No breaks. Just people forcing me to push back that moment as if nothing happened. Even though they don't think about the things that I do every single second of every day. I've gone to therapy and it does not help at all. I keep pushing but the boulder is getting heavier by the day. I can't talk to my mom because when I tell her how I feel she tells me ""Just got to keep going."" In the way, she says it to me though there is no thoughtfulness and or caring to actually hear and understand how I feel. Better than helping me get better she ended up kicking me out. Due to the fact of not pushing harder in her expectations. Also having a close family member put his hands on me to scare me. With my girl I can tell her things but no help mentally with it. I truly feel alone since my dad did this. My daughter gives me barely enough strength to push through and that hurts to say. I'm 27 but I feel like I'm a kid again lost and scared. I'm trying to be better but I don't see a light in sight.(Update)Just to summarize it. I'm still going through this pain. But more days I'm numb then others. I ended up moving back with my mother in the same house that tourments me everyday. About 2 months after being kicked out I had to comeback due to my moms mental collapse and brain aneurysm. As I'm struggling through my dad's circumstance i had to make sure my brother who has autism still made his ABA,PT and schooling on track while making sure my mom was okay. Even through the things she did. Adding on me being a father and having my own family to keep on track. My moms mental status was somewhere else for a good month. She tried running out the hospital and I had to hold her back and prevent her. Her saying ""I should be there"" killed me but I had to do that in order to get her to the point she is at now. I fully broke that day. Adding on with a metal rod from a truck coming out of no where and going through the middle of my windshield when I was going home did the trick and fully broke me that day. I sat on the side of the road for a hour just to find out nothing could be done about it. I went home and didn't talk for 3 days. Ever since then things have gotten you can say manageable . But mentally still in a bad space. My way of looking at life has went down. I call out a lot at work and they don't want to help work around me anymore and I get that. I just can't help the way I am anymore. To the point IDC if I lose my job. I know I'm not suppose to think like that.. But I'm so tired. Just want to be at least a little better.. I guess that's a lot to ask for though.. And with the news I found out from my mother  yesterday about my Dad prior to his exit out of this world killed me all over again.. it's only been a year and a half since the day my life stood still..";(Original post).                               -Update on bottom-I've never done this before but I f;;0;6;2024-03-03 16:08:11;2024-03-03;Sunday;16:08:11;3769;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:11.674872

SOME FUCKING WASHING washing doesnt matter to me i dont want clean clothes i want my mum. and then i noticed the texts went green andshe didnt respond but i thoight maybe she couldnt keep her phone number or she had no data because when i lived in a homeless shelter with her and my brother we werent allowed to have social media. doesnt make sense but i had to believe she was still alive. then i texted her on friday to check on her and my messages still went green and my calls would go straight to voicemail i tried texting her on facebook and instagram i even emailed her and i texted her best friend even though she didnt really talk to people so they hadnt texted in a few months. and then i texted my sister about it saying i was gonna go to her house to check so my sister offered to call the welfare check by police on herand then they found her and my sister called me once she found out and my life has been shattered and frozen since that phone call.she made me her legacy contact on facebook and it never even occurred to me when she did that, that she was doing it because i would need to use that function soon. and i feel so stupid it was right in front of me how could i not know?!?!?!?!? im just so sorry mama i wish i could have done something i wish i made life worth living for you. i know you told me a few years back that we were the only reason you are still here and i wish that was still true. but i know she didnt want me to interfere because she had a whole plan laid out and she went through with it I CANT believe she really did it.all i can do is cry and scream i cant eat but at least i can sleep. i am surprised i even got to sleep on friday night even though it was probably around 5am that i dozed off.if you made it here, thank you. this is really really really hard i just cant deal. im not ready for the week to start.;this is gonna be a huuuuuuge rant i just need to get a lot of things off my chest dont mind meim bac;;3;9;2024-03-03 01:02:45;2024-03-03;Sunday;01:02:45;4431;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:11.680200
1b545da;My sister's laptop and unanswered questions;silentgardeneel;TW: method discussedWe got access to my little sister's laptop today. She committed two weeks ago, or at least that is when we found her. Her funeral was wednesday of this week.It's so extremely hard. There are so many questions my parents and I have, and we hoped getting access to her laptop and phone would help. We need to unsubscribe her from all her subscriptions anyway, so we checked her emails and then browser history.It caused more questions than we thought.She committed suicide by helium and was found feb 17th. We were sure the death date must have been feb 14th, as the date is relevant (she went through a breakup which sent her spiraling into depression a year and a few months ago) and feb 14th is when she was last online on whatsapp, 3 pm.We learned today that she apparently requested to open a new bank account on feb 14th at 9 pm. We have no idea what that is about, as we haven't been able to access her bank accounts yet. But that means she was alive until the night at least.Why the hell would she do that?We also found out she ordered the things for her method back in november - she had two helium tanks, one bought in nov and a second one bought in january or february apparently. Back in nov she bought everything needed for the method.The date of the first order is just two days after we watched a movie and had what I thought was a great night...We also found out she had a subscription for lotteries. And she did a lot of stock trading or rather researching. I never knew because my sister also in the past months always said how money doesn't matter to her anymore (she had saved a lot to visit her long distance boyfriend, and after he broke up she lost interest in so many of her life goals...). Playing the lottery seemed so weird.Now we hope her phone will have more answers but, trying to piece together her life through mails is so exhausting.We also saw she checked a psychiatric clinic in our uni town for their wait list but it was closed when we checked.I just want to hug her.;TW: method discussedWe got access to my little sister's laptop today.

1b52dg6;It’s a bad night;OkBalance2833;Sorry for posting again I just don’t know where else too. This is the worst night I’ve had with grief. The shock wore off a week ago, I’ve been going through it this week but tonight everything is hitting.He’s actually gone, I 100% know I won’t have the chance to say goodbye now, so he just left and that was it never seen or heard from again. I was SO fucking certain he would’ve only done this if on drugs or drinking and he didn’t. There’s literally no explanation other than he wanted to die. Why didn’t he fucking tell someone what was going on? Everything is destroyed. Like literally everything. I hate this life without him. I’m struggling so bad but having to function so I can look after the baby. I’ve lost so much weight, I had a therapy session but genuinely these will be pointless I can tell already. It won’t bring him back and that’s the only thing that would fix this. It kills me that he hid how much pain he must’ve been in but I’m so fucking angry, he didn’t even TRY to get help. He didn’t even tell anyone. He just killed himself.I have never in my life come close to feeling pain like this and the person I speak to when everything is falling apart? He’s dead now. He’s why everything has fell apart.Out of everything why was our baby not enough to stay for, he’s going to wonder that too. He literally won’t remember you soon he’s a literal baby. What happened to protecting him from this world? All the fucking plans for him growing up? And I swear to god the next person that tells me I’m young enough to meet someone that’ll take us both on I’ll flip at, I don’t fucking want that. I want my son to know his dad, the one who was his best mate and loved him more than anything. Even if we didn’t sort things out and met other people, I wanted him to know his dad.I’m sobbing my eyes out and probably rambling. I’ll probs end up deleting this too but I don’t know where to post or who to speak too and I’m currently completely falling apart.

I have so many hard days in a row coming, these were supposed to beautiful days, where we talk about the magic we both felt connecting with each other. How random it was,how serendipitous it was that we lived in such close proximity to each other. The romance between us didn’t last, but my god the way you asked me to dinner, could never be topped. The confidence, the arrogance of the invite, was so appealing, how could I say no. It didn’t matter that our relationship shifted to being platonic, I had never had a healthier relationship with any man. The way we were able to communicate, authentically, with raw vulnerability, was so refreshing. I felt safe showing you the worst parts of me, having you see them, and still accept me for me, was a gift I could never repay. I’m mad you’re there and not here, I’m so grateful for everyday I spent with you, everyday you showed up for me, everyday I was given the space to be myself, with your full acceptance.

1b4psa9;My best friend hung himself in a mental institution last week Saturday. He was taken off of life support this Wednesday.;Jephobi;It all happened so quickly. He went missing last week Monday…we all thought he was safe when he was found and sectioned…that now he was in the care of professionals, and could get some help and cool off. I sent him a text when he was found, he gave me a quick reply. I eased off - I assumed he and his family would want privacy. I decided I’d wait until they were comfortable with people doing visitation.Turns out that when the police found him, he was on top of a building getting ready to jump…I had no fucking idea. No idea at all. I wasn’t told until after we found out he had hung himself. If I’d known I would have been so much more in touch with him.It’s all so strange. We had literally just moved in with each other at the beginning of this month. His first television role, a small part but in a really good TV show, was about to air. We were making so many plans for the future, and he occasionally seemed down - but on the whole he seemed positive. He was meeting new people, had stopped drinking, was making so many positive changes in his life.I loved him so much. I believed in him so much. I told him this whenever I got the opportunity…honestly, I think everyone did. He was so charming - you couldn’t help but appreciate him. He had his phone when he made the decision to go - I just don’t understand why he didn’t text me or call me, or anybody else, just try to get in touch somehow. I guess he was impulsive to the very end. Such a permanent decision - I’m still having trouble adapting to this new version of reality, and the permanence of his decision.I keep thinking about his last moments. I feel almost certain that he must have regretted his decision as he made it…hanging. What a way to go. I keep thinking about him realising what a mistake he had made. I don’t know how to reconcile this…it’s so painful to think about. Part of me hopes that he really hated all of us, his family and friends, and that he really wanted to go - so that I don’t have to imagine that his final moments were filled with fear and regret. So I can imagine that his last moments were filled with genuine relief. But I don’t know how realistic that is. I’ll never know. He had so much to live for…some problems, but really nothing that couldn’t be fixed. If he had just given it a year - honestly, even 3 months. He was so close to doing so well.I don’t know how to end this post…yeah.;It all happened so quickly. He went missing last week Monday…we all thought he was safe when he was ;;9;72;2024-03-02 14:41:29;2024-03-02;Saturday;14:41:29;2391;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:11.687568
1b4ozy5;My boyfriend passed on Thursday ;Mountain-Might-1619;"He and I originally bonded overshared experiences with someone who abused both of us and quickly became friends 4 years ago. I could never give him a the relationship he wanted  due to the distance between us and the fact that I'm going through some major life changes (changing careers, countries and life goals) and for the first year and half he was still with his previous partner (she agreed to being open) but we loved each other a lot and I relied on him. We were long distance for 2 years with constant contact and planned visits.We talked every day but he started saying things about how i was the only good thing in his life, he lost his job and moved back with his parents (he always said they didn't get along but they took care of him), he had kind of a chip on his shoulder, he would talk about suicide openly and I always told him I didn't like that talk and that I would be devastated if anything happened to him. i tried hard to help him change his mindset and take care of himself I tried to get him to seek treatment. I felt like he was just slipping deeper and deeper and it was harder to reach him. I was always there when I could be and would do as much as I could but I know I could have done more ( I have a history of having other people in my life attempt to take their own so a part of me was building walls). We'd been able to see each other in person twice and enjoy being together. He was so smart and creative and I wanted the best for him. He was an amazing person who deserved the best and I tried. The day of he was asking me when we would see each other again, we had been talking about it a lot recently and I continued to tell him that I wanted. to see him but the situation wasn't good (I lost my job and just started working again, I'm living with my parents while I go to grad school, I'm struggling with my own mental health). He seemed upset that I told him that I didn't know and that I wanted to but didn't know when. He said something like ""I guess that's it for me"" and an hour later posted his goodbye on instagram. I called him three times when I saw it and texted him telling him i would contact the police (he has done things like this before and when I bring up the police he usually texts back and says I was just out dont worry Im sorry I worried you). His father called me and was a little vague but I knew he had taken his own life. Later his dad called back and confirmed he was gone.I truly feel that I was his justification for ending his life. I was isolating myself when he needed me and  I feel like because of my own issues with my mental health and my fatigue of supporting him that I let him go when he needed me most. I feel so guilty and horrible. I really loved him and I wish I had tried harder to remind him that I would never leave him.";He and I originally bonded overshared experiences with someone who abused both of us and quickly bec;;4;7;2024-03-02 14:03:53;2024-03-02;Saturday;14:03:53;2806;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:11.688829
1b4o3ex;My husband took his life on Monday;FaithlessnessMost432;My husband and I met in college and were together for over 25 years. He had mental health issues from the beginning, which led to increasingly abusive behavior over the years, and I have a lot of trauma over those memories (it got extremely bad). I was finally working on divorcing/separating from him, and he took his life on Monday while I was at the courthouse moving things forward. I found him when I came home, and without going into the details, it was extremely traumatizing. I have a very confusing mix of emotions, as I have been so hurt by his abuse over the years, yet I loved and cared about him so much. I tried so hard to help him, but I couldn’t, and then I focused on helping myself, and this is what happened. I could use some advice for dealing with the loss of an abusive partner. We have three kids, one in college, one in high school and one in middle school. The oldest and I have been in therapy for two years already, and I am looking into trauma counseling and EMDR. My middle child is against therapy and is 18 so I can’t make him go, but I will encourage him. I will make sure the youngest gets help processing his grief (he is mostly trying not to think about it), but am not sure when to start. Due to the circumstances, we will not be living in the house again and I am looking for a rental (we are currently at my in-laws), but am unsure of what to take or not take there with us. I have a lot of support and people wanting to help, but I don’t know what help I need or want. I also know my husband would have been so hurt about all the support I’m getting from his family (he blamed me for everything and would feel so betrayed by them). Again, so many conflicting emotions.;My husband and I met in college and were together for over 25 years.

1b4gpml;10 year anniversary this spring;empathetic_caterwaul;"I'm 25, dad killed himself when I was 15. The story sucks. It is long and unnecessarily convoluted. Lately I have been realizing that I'll never know what he was really like. I don't have a positive idea of him. My mom and him always hated each other and bc of that appreciating him as a father is both new and kind of horrifying.Super traumatic things that come up lately:>! Lately I have been remembering more of my childhood and I think he tried to kill me. It stresses me out. I dont know.what of my memories are real. I didn't when I was a child either. My sister said she remembers my parents fighting while we waited outside, and my leaving her to go try stop them. I don't remember that, but I do remember threatening my dad with the cops and fighting him in a miriad of ways.I remember finding my dad after he would leave us to go get fucked up in his truck for weeks on end in the fields near our house. I remember trying to protect my sister and her friend from his ""rough housing"" and him breaking my arm. But my family doesnt remember things that way. I remember him holding my head under water in the bath tub, and I remember thinking internally that I hoped he would kill me so he could feel awful about it. I remember my mom fighting him in the bathroom shortly after that.I am struggling because I am now realizing he was obviously mentally ill his whole life, and he needed major help for years. His dad was the kind to brag to me about torturing animals for fun. And his mom also killed herself. Shortly after him. I don't think his childhood was easy either.!<I wish he had given me the chance to get to know him as an adult. But I stead I think he assumed I'd hate him forever. Which, maybe. But now I don't know. I can't fathom who he was. I can't remember what our relationship was like. I know there were things I liked about it, but I only recall awful memories.I'm so angry. At the time I wasn't talking to him. He never gave me the chance to say descent last words to him. I don't even know what mine were. Something awful, I think. No chance for resolution. Before he died I assumed he would kill himself soon, and after he died I knew before I was told. I always thought it lead to the best changes I've ever seen in the rest of my family. But now... Idk that I was wrong, but I've been going through some of his writings. They are so wholesome and sweet. Lovely things he found in the woods. Puns. Dad jokes. But when I was a kid, I viscerally remember screaming at him and explicitly rejecting him as a dad when he said stuff I'm reading... Idk. The rest of what I feel doesn't feel utterable. I still blame myself for setting him up to die. It's so hard to process what I'm feeling about it all. For years I've felt responsible for his suicide. I have believed I planned it. This may be the closest I've ever come to a new relationship with his suicide, because I'm angry at him as well as myself. But I always felt his way on some level. I just hate this :( The intensity of my distress is a lot less than when he just died, but it still comes up pretty badly at times. Idk how I can still be so torn up about this dumb shit without even remembering it fully. I had a few attempts in college and felt very complicit in the family suicide chain at the time. I am not so depressed anymore. Which is amazing. But my own attempts are a source of guilt and complication in all this too. Please feel free to share your own stories or advice. I see a therapist and do a lot to process. Idk what I'm looking for, but it would be lovely to hear even one person finds this relatable.";I'm 25, dad killed himself when I was 15. The story sucks.

1b4fldm;Feeling empty and lonely, how do I cope with this?;sunflower-00;Three weeks ago, I tragically lost my partner to suicide. In his final moments, he shared that he was battling depression and despite thinking it had improved, it relapsed,, leaving him feeling like a mere shell of himself.I'm still struggling to come to terms with this devastating loss. In the days leading up to the event, we spent time together, and there were no apparent signs of his inner turmoil. He remained his usual cheerful self, which makes his sudden departure even more difficult to comprehend.On the day it happened, I was at work, and he texted me as usual, giving no indication of his intentions. He was known for his selflessness, kindness, and cheerfulness, always prioritizing others above himself. I've never encountered anyone quite like him, and I have countless wonderful things to say about him. Never ending.I'm plagued by countless questions, feelings of anger, and guilt. Could I have been a better partner? Were there signs that I missed? Should I have been more attentive? Did I fail him in some way? These questions haunt me every day. He reassured me that his struggles were not my fault and that being with me was the happiest time of his life. Yet, I can't help but wonder why he chose to leave if that was the case. I have no understanding of depression, but I was wondering, perhaps he could've reached out.Living with this pain has become unbearable. I've tried to confide in my friends, but their well-intentioned advice to stay strong only amplifies my sense of isolation. At times, I've even considered joining him, as a way to escape the overwhelming suffering. Our plans for the future now lay shattered, adding to the overwhelming sense of loss and despair.

I’ve been sleeping okay but not really had many dreams I can remember, especially with him in it.  Last night I had an extremely vivid dream with him and I. I just wanted to share this dream. I woke up crying but it was more happy tears and it felt like a sign from him or some higher power.  We loved to hike and camp and in my dream, we were sat in the Chisos Basin of Big Bend, sipping coffee, laughing and talking, it was right after lunchtime. We were then saying together “let’s go for a hike up the window trail!”. We were then stood at the trail entrance and I was walking up but realized in my dream I was walking alone and he couldn’t come up because he was passed away, but yet he was still sat down at the site we we’re having coffee. I told him I really missed him but understood why he had to be down there, but I just missed walking with him and wished he be with me.  I felt him smiling kindly, telling me he was okay and I was okay to keep going up the trail.  I kept on going to the top then started back down, hoping I could make it back to where he was sat. But as I was coming down the trail, I woke up.  I’ve been crying all day about this dream. It’s made me quite emotional but I am taking it as a positive sign.;This is my first time posting, I lost my boyfriend to suicide almost three months ago.

1b46fe6;6 years since my older-younger brother died. ;IntelligentInsurance;"6 years.6. Six. Since my brother died. The hardest thing this year has been my lifestyle change. I got a new job and I've done alot of business travel, likely weekly flights. It means I'm visiting new places, staying in nice places. It also means I'm on planes a lot and get new experiences.And as the plane takes off, I stare down on the city and country I've been in and think... - Did he ever visit this country? This city? - What would he think of the restaurant I was at last night?And the more I wonder about his thoughts, I've been slowly realising that he's been frozen in time. Amit didn't go through the pandemic. He didn't go through the last 6 years of worldly experiences.  And as time goes on, the person, or evolution of his thoughts are frozen in time.That means, if I thought, ""I wonder what my big brother would've said?"", that perspective has completely shifted. Because I'm older. And his perspective is locked in time. And it feels like.. as I get older, he becomes further away. And the more I remember that I'm on my own. The memories I have of us are with me. He had no kids, I will have no kids and his memory will die with me. So it'll be like he never existed. I'm so numb. I've been a shell of a person. I finally went to the dentist this year. I haven't been since he died. 10 fillings. What's the point, anyway? Gaining weight. Had alopecia. I hate this life. At least he doesn't have to go through this. I guess this is one of the reasons he probably did it.";6 years.6. Six. Since my brother died. The hardest thing this year has been my lifestyle change.

1b3pcsa;It’ll be 6 months;RepresentativeOk2648;I have been struggling because my husband was acting very very strange for months prior to taking his life. He had a drinking problem and in one of his drunken times he moved to the basement and never came back up which he could have done at any time. I have so much regret for not telling him to come back upstairs and of course theirs something still between us because he didn’t think there was.  He went to his uncles funeral in March of 2023 and obtained a hand gn which I had ZERO clue about and we had a gn safe. So why not tell me about it so we could put it in there. He was wanting me to go to events with him then told me not to. Then he told me to evict him which I couldn’t and his behavior was something I had never seen in 7 years. I told him I loved him and wanted to be with him but I am having a hard time with the drinking and behaviors. The morning of he came upstairs with our daughter who slept with him all night (still shocks me because he never let the kids sleep with us) snuggled our kids. It was busy getting ready for work and 3 kids to get out the door. He got up late which was odd and only had his back faced to me (but for months he wasn’t talking nicely to my face so I didn’t want to upset him) but I asked him if he could change over the laundry since our kiddos peed on a blanket and I said if you can’t before you leave for work I can do it later. He tells me no I can change it over and I asked are you not going into to work it’s getting late and he said he had some assessments to do this morning so he was gonna leave a little later. Not out of the ordinary and then he helped me get the kids inside the car and never let me see his face. He didn’t leave a note. When I got home later that afternoon I checked and he had changed over the laundry little did I know he had been gone since that morning. But I felt so loved and now I asked myself did he not love me or think I didn’t love him. Like that thought kills me. He didn’t leave a note, but part of me wonders if he pushed me away so that it wouldn’t hurt when he decided he was gonna take his own life. I found out after he took his life that not only did he struggle with alcohol but he was doing adderall and cocaine off and on his whole teen/adult life. Vaping thc, and taking his depression meds which weren’t doing anything with this mixture with alcohol. I feel like I failed him, missed something, should have loved him harder, better, should have said come upstairs. I feel like I should have been able to help or why didn’t he tell me about the gn. He had a history of childhood sexual abuse, introduced to alcohol and porn at a young age. He was cheating during our time together which was very hard on the relationship for me and caused alot of trust issues.

He told me he was a sad sad dude and I tried to get him to open up and talk but he would only get angry and say hurtful things like I never wanted him or push me away. I don’t feel to blame but I do all at the same time like why couldn’t he open up and say I’m hurting hey I think I want to end my life. Like he knew I would have supported him I told him I supported him if he needed meds, therapy etc. I’m just so lost without him most night I don’t sleep or can’t stay asleep. Even though it wasn’t perfect and our system needed some oil and help he was my safe place being next to him and in his arms.

1b3o83x;I wish I had known about this community sooner;pompoususername;I lost my older sister to suicide back in October 2021, when I was 19. I had practically no one but my mom to support me (on a daily basis, that is) as the friends I had at the time abandoned me because I “never seemed to enjoy myself when we hang out as a group anymore” and it made them “uncomfortable”. I felt so lonely, so alone. She was supposed to be there for me. I wanted to run to her for comfort but I couldn’t. My mom and I joined a Survivors of Suicide (SOS) support group, which was great, but it was 95% parents who had lost children. It still helped me a lot, but there wasn’t anyone who’d lost a sibling like me.  So I wish I’d know about this group bc I think having people who experienced the same thing as me would’ve really helped at the time. This experience uprooted my entire life, and I had to learn how to replant myself from scratch.I guess the point of this post is to 1) vent, and 2) find people who can relate in the sibling department. If you’ve gone through the same thing (or even if you haven’t), feel free to comment, vent, or start a conversation. I never know how to comment on these types of posts, if I’m even giving good advice or if I’m talking about myself too much, so I want this post to be a space where you don’t have to worry about any of that - just comment whatever you feel you need to say.;I lost my older sister to suicide back in October 2021, when I was 19.

1b3lzoa;One year tomorrow;samsir0;"Tomorrow (March 1) marks one year since my father committed suicide.  I took the day off from work back in January just in case I felt like I needed it.  I’m still not sure what to do with the day off, though.  I have a surprise birthday party to go to in the evening, which I am really looking forward to.  It is a welcome distraction because I will be surrounded by some very close friends who understand the significance of the day.  And they are the type of friends who will NOT bring it up… which is exactly what I need.I have typed and deleted so much more after this, but nothing sounds right.  I’m just at a loss.I thought I could act like tomorrow is just another day, but I’m already a mess tonight.  I have a dark sense of humor, so I keep joking to myself about the Leap Year skewing the timeline.  Honestly, the joking helps.  My dad would’ve laughed at that remark.  He would’ve chuckled if I had said, “Well, what day do you want us to mourn you next year?!!  It’s a Leap Year; you just freakin’ complicated it for us!!”But I am dreading the clock tomorrow.  I, unfortunately, remember the exact time I got “the call.”  I don’t remember the exact time it was when the police confirmed to me and my husband that my dad was gone, but I have such vivid memories of that night.I’m not posting for any other reason other than… I have nowhere to air this out in real time right now, and I am feeling very fucking sad.  I think tomorrow might suck, and I resent that possibility.Too many days have already been bad days for “no” reason.  I am going to do my best to enjoy my day tomorrow in honor of my daddy.Sorry to anyone who is visiting this sub.  I love you.  I’m sorrry for what you are going through.

I have not written this as any type of advice, these are just my thoughts.This is where my head is. I know he didn't mean to hurt me or any of my family. I know he would be devastated about the pain that he has caused us. I will never agree with what he did, but I will myself to have compassion. Even to respect his decision.I believe that to truly honor him is to live the life he would want for us.I never want to be angry at him, because I feel that he is the true victim.But here is the problem, I seem to be frozen in time, unable to see the future. To picture the future is to accept a world in which he isn't. I don't even move day by day, I move action to action.

1b34z6b;Can I tell you what happened?;Guilty-Store-2972;I can't bring myself to think about it and really feel it most of the time, let alone can I tell someone. My family and partner knows but in the 3 years since it happened I just haven't opened up about it. I can't show them my feelings, I can barely connect to them myself. It's just too much. I just want to tell you guys all that I can bring myself to say so that I have said it and can feel some support. My Dad died when I was 19, 3 years ago, he was 37, and he took his own life after a psychotic episode. He struggled his entire life with his mental health and I never knew until he died. Before he died, I didn't check on him for two weeks, because I thought he would be okay, and I feel like it's my fault he's gone. He was all I had, I had no family growing up because my Mum isolated me from the rest of my family and I never really felt like I had a Mum, we don't even have contact anymore. We moved schools constantly so I never kept friends. All I had was my Dad, and he wasn't perfect but he actually cared about me. And then I learn when he died that all he had was me, he was totally isolated and his family never supported him. The doctors didn't help him with severe mental health issues. He was such a kind and loving person and he didn't deserve the life and death he had. Now I am able to talk to my family, and nobody was even with me when he died, and they don't talk about him. It's like everyone's forgotten about him. I just want somebody to care. All I could do for years after was nothing, I shut down and I still can't process it. I haven't even told my therapist. I'll be fine, I know how to cope, I have hope again, even though things are hard. But he wasn't fine and it's not fair. He didn't deserve any of it. I'm not looking for advice, I just want to be listened to and heard, I just want his death to be recognised. It was real and everyone acts like it's not. He died and I still can't believe it.;I can't bring myself to think about it and really feel it most of the time, let alone can I tell som;;12;50;2024-02-29 16:49:59;2024-02-29;Thursday;16:49:59;1934;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:11.716937

The numb blanket that is known to wash over people who are in the initial stages of shock was no stranger to and embraced me eagerly and tightly, enveloping me. Today I cried for the first time, the first real emotion I’ve felt since receiving the news, I finally gave into it, the fact he was no longer here.Yesterday I went to spend time with some friends, the whole night felt like a charade. I thought it would help to distract myself, but really I couldn’t focus on anything other than my best friend. I’m still grieving over the sudden death of another childhood friend from last year, this is compounding.I’ve done that thing, where you look back through all your social media accounts in the hopes to find some fragments of conversations, some old pixelated photos. I think that’s what finally pushed all the emotions out. I dunno what to do next, I guess be there for my friends who are also mourning. I feel so lost and sad…;My best friend is gone.

1b315i9;My brother is gone;Nice55661234;We always had a good relationship. I took care of him our whole lives. This past Saturday 2/24/24 my brother(22) took his life. He knew I was supposed to pick him up for work that morning. I got there and he never answered the knocks. I realized the door was unlocked which was very wrong I went in the house and checked his room and the bathroom and rest of the house I didn’t look in our mom’s room. I left thinking he got  another ride and went to our mother’s job to ask if she could call his manager and see if he made it in. I’m always worried about him. She said he was MIA she hadn’t been able to get in touch with him. I immediately knew something was wrong . I picked up my stepdad and we raced to their house he went to check my brothers room and  had a weird pulling sensation to go to my mothers room. I saw his legs on the bed the lights were off I punched him and said “wake the crap up your gonna be late dude” . He didn’t wake up I turned on the lights and was in complete total shock my brother had literally “blown his brains out” not just small head shot. The blood and brains were everywhere I can see it even when my eyes are open. He didn’t leave a note. He posed himself on our mother’s side of the bed before he did it. To look like he was resting until you saw his head was nonexistent. When my mom made it home I had to basically tackle her to the ground to keep her from going inside she didn’t need to see her baby this way. I don’t understand. Did he hate me? Why did he want me to find him? He knew I was the one coming. Why didn’t he leave a note? He had been suicidal in the past 3 different times every time he called me I would drop every go get him and he stayed with me and my husband and kids. We fed him, clothed him, took care of him. Offered him help we tried countless times to get him help we even offered to fully pay for him so he didn’t have to worry about that but he didn’t want to go. He didn’t call me this time. Why didn’t he call me? I don’t understand . I tried to do everything I could think of to help him. To help him see that he was loved and cared for. I found out he had called our grandparents and told them he loved them the night before. Stayed up till 3 am to tell mom he loved her. Contacted everyone on his discord to tell them he loved them and he was sorry. But not me I don’t know how to cope with this how to even breathe since this has happened. I’m trying my best I’m a mom to a 6 and 3 year old but it’s so hard to complete anything without balling my eyes out everywhere I look in my house has memories of my brother. I’m probably never going to be the same and I hate that I hate this happened. I hate that I hate him for doing this I feel like such a complete pile of crap for feeling that way. He told me he was getting better and he lied to me I was always so worried about him . To make my suffering from this even worse my family is too weak to even plan his funeral so I’ve had to step up and do it. Listening to my mother scream at the funeral home because they couldn’t show her my brothers face one last time. She doesn’t even know he doesn’t have one left and I am going to have to live with that forever.I’m sorry to whoever reads this if it causes you anguish or brings back past traumas I just needed to get it out.

We went on a walk, he listened to me talk about work (I’m a freaking probate paralegal) and he let me go to bed that night without mentioning anything. He hadn’t been sleeping in our bed for going on a year now (said it was because he liked to watch tv at night to fall asleep while I didn’t). Then that morning, he didn’t hug or kiss me goodbye. We just did our normal yell as I ran out the door trying not to be late, “love you, have a good day”. He always added “be safe” since I commuted to work.

Or so I thought anyway. I keep thinking about those 5 minutes that he was here with me. And the one thing that sticks out was that he acted SO normal. Like absolutely nothing different about him. Other than the fact he swung by on his way to work which he had never done before but other than that he was perfectly himself. He might have been a tiny bit in a hurry but I just assumed it was him needing to get to work. He took a cup of coffee to go, said I love you as he left and took his life 20 minutes after walking out my front door. I was the last person to ever see or speak to him again. I was his very last hug. I just can’t stop thinking about what was going through his mind when he was here. HOW did he manage to remain so calm and so normal knowing the reason why he was here. He knew that he was here to say a final goodbye, he knew this was the last time he’d ever be in my house or seeing me. And he knew that as he hugged me goodbye that later that day I’d find out the most traumatic, devastating news of my life.But he just stayed so normal and so calm that it’s so hard to think about how much pain he was in while he was saying goodbye. I hate that he was hurting so bad right in front of me and I didn’t even see it.Did he not want me to worry? Did he feel like he was doing me a favor by taking his life and that’s why he was so himself? Did he even have the mental capacity in that moment to even think about anything else other than saying goodbye to me and finishing what he had planned for the day?These questions will eat at me forever. Being the last person someone chose to see before ending their life is a heavy honor I will carry with me forever but I will always feel terrible that I didn’t notice anything was even slightly off with him that day.;I struggle with this every single day since my boyfriend ended his life.He came to visit me and tell;;36;122;2024-02-28 21:24:48;2024-02-28;Wednesday;21:24:48;1917;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:11.730284

1b2ffkg;coping?;Cute-Car3031;ill keep it short April 11th, 2022 my father went missing, left notes, clothes he wanted to be buried in, along with 2 swiss army knives for me and one for my sister. knew he wasnt coming back, i knew he was dead.April 12th, 2022he was found. not only was he found, but found in the place where i told them to look repeatedly. but noone listens to the 14 year old.i mean i know its hard to believe, but during those 14 years my father was more than a bestfriend to me, he really was you know- everything to me. i wish i could describe my bond and relationship with him here. although we fought like dogs we loved eachother more than anything. shared my music taste, interests, everything with him. he really was my first love and first man to break my heart. it never really hit me until a good while after it. i guess being 14 but emotionally mature for my age i was able to pull through better than anyone else, i guess im just “mentally strong” because i knew he wouldnt want me to be upset about it. im 16 now. i know you cant change the past. i know all these things. but why do i still long for him, why cant i go one day without thinking about him. why is this world so cruel. my family just want to send me to therapy but thats not what i want. im his daughter, like him i just “thug it out” as he did but we seen how that played out. the support was immense from everyone at the timing of his passing. but now i feel like noone cares. i did become a horrible person when he passed i can admit to that. ive grown more and matured from losing someone i cannot replace.recently its just been getting harder, noone understands how i feel. im in no way suicidal, im just sad and angry that he left. i understand with time comes change, and you dont heal you just accept it. but how like i dont understand how. i dont know how ive lasted this long being able to ignore it, yes im still numb from it-  but like i geniunely dont have words anymore. i need advice on how to cope and make it easier for myself to accept it. i cant tell if its been ten days or coming up to 2 years. he was geniunely my bestfriend, my protector, my reason. like youre telling me i have to live the rest of my life without him. im still a kid, i never emotionally relied on anyone apart from him. its painful to know my father died in his darkest mental space, surrounded by sadness and memories. to be honest, its no suprise it left me in disbelief and complicated grief. it irks me. im not looking for attention or validation, im just looking for advice on how to make coping easier. thank you.;ill keep it short April 11th, 2022 my father went missing, left notes, clothes he wanted to be burie;;3;14;2024-02-28 19:48:22;2024-02-28;Wednesday;19:48:22;2576;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:13.076782

1b2c747;How do I forgive myself;Educational-Leek5446;My girlfriend killed herself…When I was 14 years old I lost my virginity to this girl I’d like to keep anonymous. she was my buddies sister .. this is in chronological order. we dated on and off a couple times in high school but my senior year she starts dating my little brother.( they were the same age and I no longer lived next door so she was his girl next door now. ) Well her and my bro break up she moves away back to her moms 2 hours away.  she ends up having a kid with this kid who I think was a druggy he’s dead now from overdose . So then she’s single and has an almost 2 year old baby and she says she’s pregnant with my kid cause now we had sex like 3-4 times at first I was happy . At that point in my life my only skill was selling weed honestly. I started freaking out and yeah I ended up leaving the state changing my number everything .. not even my family knew what happened to me . But after about a month I checked on her and she already had a new bf and they were calling her his on social media . Well I told her I was going to stay out the way honestly i regretted it I was a terrible alcoholic and pot dealer . So now her and this new guy she has a baby already and my daughter is born and she passed away at 3 months old from sids.. it drove me further into alcohol . Looking back now I see where she tried telling me then she was suicidal . So our daughter is gone and she has another daughter with this new guy he cheats or whatever so she’s single again . Even after I leave her high and dry everything she says she wants to come over and see me .. I end up spending 3 nights with her and she wants to move in with her two kids and we agreed she was going to move in . And so a few days later after she’s left back home I start thinking maybe we’re moving too fast .. so I ask my mom and tell her I feel like it’s all moving too fast and she says yeah you should probably tell her . So I do I tell her we need to talk and that I don’t want to breakup or anything but maybe her moving in is too fast . And she responded with “how could you do this to me again” because during that 3 day stay I had came in her one time . Well the phone went silent in text and I went home and drank and really thought about her moving in and everything and by the time I went to sleep I decided I was going to call her in the morning and tell her she should move her stuff in . In the morning my mom called me to ask when the last time I had heard from her was and I said after we talked and I told her I was about to call her and that’s when my mom told me her father called her and said that she had hung herself that night . I was so sick when my mom told me that .. It felt like a nightmare . I was so depressed and honestly suicidal. Her mother texted me saying this is my fault and that I’m the last one to talk to her and basically saying all of this is my fault . But honestly I don’t think that’s fair to say because her brother raped her and our daughter passed and she blamed herself so she had trauma .. a lot of it . But she rarely came to town and she like brought my mom a plant and went to see everybody which was nice but rare so hindsight I really feel like she was coming to tell everyone bye and her coming over to me was actually sudden and might have changed her mind .But Iv taken responsibility for my actions.. I ran off on her and the fact she still loved me I felt like one day I could fix the situation with our daughter I never expected her to pass away so suddenly and then her committing suicide . There buried next to each other now and I really want to be buried there too but her family would never allow that  ..Iv never actually got to say the whole story before . I know this is long .

1b1w27y;Goodbyes you didn’t get to say are the hardest. ;Jeepsandhoes;I used to work at a coffee shop and made a lot of “relationships” with regular customers. I’d talk to them about their life, weekend, everything. We’d chat for as long as they’d stand there. I quit and moved almost a year ago but still regularly talk to my ex coworkers. I found out today one of my regulars killed themself and I’m genuinely heartbroken. We had nicknames for each other, I’d go out of my way everytime he came through to go say hi to him. Literally would be elbow deep in dishwater running to the window to tell him hi. They’d even let me know he was there if I didn’t have a headset on. He gave me a stuffed animal that I keep on my shelf. He was genuinely one of my favorite people and always the highlight of my day. I’m honestly so distraught. I know it’s not my fault, but I can’t help but feel like if I hadn’t left maybe I could’ve been there for him. I can’t imagine what he was going through to feel the need to do what he did. I’ve had suicidal ideations since I was in kindergarten but have always fought through them. I’ve made it a point to always be kind to everyone and listen to them when they’re down because that’s what I needed in those times but no one was here for me. Everytime I lose someone like this it feels like a chunk of me goes with them. I’m so unbelievably heartbroken. I should’ve given him my number. I should’ve reached out. I should’ve stayed. I should’ve done something. I didn’t even get to say goodbye to him before I quit. I didn’t get to say goodbye before I moved. I didn’t get to say goodbye. I didn’t get to tell him that he made my terrible days so much better. I didn’t get to tell him that he made my life worth living sometimes. I didn’t get to tell him how truly amazing and genuine he was. I had moved to another state when I worked here and was the loneliest I have ever been but these customers really made me feel like i wasn’t. I know it’s not my fault, and I truly doubt I meant as much to him as he meant to me. But it doesn’t make it any easier. I’m so sorry Jimothy. You truly deserved better than that.

I'm still very confused about the circumstances in which he lied and manipulated his friends, but was made aware it has been ongoing for years. I shouldve known that this was his way of crying out for help. I ignored it out of anger and feelings of betrayal.  I shouldnt have abandoned him in his time of need.

1b1ajv0;I may need to remove myself from social media at this point…;Pycharming;With Aaron Bushnell publicly killing himself, people in my social circle are praising his actions and posting pictures of him ON FIRE in their instagram stories and Facebook posts. There’s already artistic graphics of him. And while I’m pro Palestine (not interested in debating that here please) suicide is suicide. My brother killed himself in the same method these folks are touting as “the ultimate sign of protest”. And I’ve spent months tip toeing around it, feeling guilty when I overshare, and being afraid to truly talk to my friends about what happened because the only reaction I’ve gotten so far is “fuuuuuuck!” and visible distress. But these people casually share these photos like it’s a picture of a water melon. And don’t get me started about the discourse. Based on what I’ve seen today I can expect to see a lot of people saying the most ignorant things about mental illness as a way to not detract from the free Palestine movement. I’m seeing people say that he could not be mentally ill because of his job… where he held a position that’s pretty much the same as mine, and I’m very much mentally ill. I just lost a distant friend last week who held a similarly job to suicide.

1b17sg8;Almost seven years ;Responsible-Ship7346;Hi, my mom commit when I (21F) was 15. It’ll be seven years this year. Woah. Crazy to think that I’ve made it this far after she died. I’m not a girl anymore. Well, I wasn’t really anymore after it happened. I didn’t really realize how much of girlhood I missed out on because she died, you know? And everybody did their best with the shitty hand she dealt us, but it’s still so lonely sometimes.It’s like my brothers all shot in 3 different directions, and so even though we all lost our mom it’s barely the same trauma for all of us. And then there’s my dad. And I love my dad, he’s done so many wonderful things, but he’s also said some of the worst stuff that I’ll never forget. And it still hurts. And I’m still figuring out how to grow up without a mom. And it hurts. It really feels like I’m navigating my life all by myself. The only girl in a house full of boys. I love my brothers but I feel like a fish out of water with all of them sometimes. Then again, they seem to tell me the same thing. Maybe it’s just some hard conversations keeping us from being a closer family. I still want to call her all the time. I still remember the smell of her hairspray and her labtop and how she’d sit under the covers. She was such a good mother. Such a wonderful, wonderful mother. And she had an abusive mother, who had an abusive mother, and she decided she didn’t want me to have any of that. She nurtured my interests, let me decide when and how I wanted to try things like makeup and buying my own clothes and doing my hair. Even when she didn’t understand, she trusted me to follow my own path to joy. And I will never ever forget that.And I’m a junior in college now. And I still have days when I’m suddenly hit with that wave of realization that I carry a grief my classmates don’t share. It’s lonely. I feel lonely a lot. And the world feels grey. But I’ve made it this far, so much farther than I ever thought I’d go. And there’s still so much life to live, so many more unconventional paths that my mom would think are so strange but she’d never say it, she’d trust me to follow my own joy. I hope she’s cheering me on from heaven. I could really use a cheerleader like her right now. And she was, she was a dancer and a cheerleader. And a damn good mother.I miss you mom.

1b13kfh;EMDR Therapy;Lynch52358;I wanted to mention EMDR therapy to everyone in here. When I tell people about it, almost nobody knows what it is. With the trauma we have all been through in here, it might help ease the situations we are all going through. It stands for Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing. Basically how it works is with a therapist they will have you think about the trauma much like watching a movie in your head. You have your eyes closed and hold these little vibrating paddles. What they do is make your eyes go into a REM type state and forces your brain to think about your trauma differently, in a different area of your brain, which helps you heal the trauma. I cannot say enough good things about this type of therapy. My therapist is a leading specialist in my area for this treatment and I had some things from my past I couldn’t even talk about. Now, I can, and do and in a positive light that I never thought was possible. To say it is INTENSE, is an understatement. You will cry, be mad, whatever you need to do, but you will feel a thousand times better. They usually do like 3 minute sessions and then you take a little break and talk about it. Before you start, you will rate that trauma on a scale of 1-10. 10 being the worst. If after the break and if you’re still rating that high like an 9, 8, 7, whatever, you will do another 3 minute session. You will literally not even understand how the hell you feel better, and a few hours typically for me after my sessions I couldn’t believe how my brain kept processing and digesting that trauma. Then, one day you realize that holy hell, you haven’t thought about it or when a memory comes up, it just comes and goes but it doesn’t kick your ass like it used to. Do a little Google research on it or talk to a counselor about it. There is an EXCELLENT book about it called “Getting Past Your Past” It is by Francine Sharpiro, who basically developed the method by accident. Sorry to ramble on, but I am telling you, it WILL change your life. Love to all. ❤️;I wanted to mention EMDR therapy to everyone in here.

1b0vl1p;It  feels like everyone just forgets;Lonely-Drink-1843;I didn't mean for this to get so long sorry. You can skip to the end for questions. My ex girlfriend took her own her own life, it's been 7 years (to the month but not day). I reached out to her parents every year. This year however they both requested I no longer try to get in contact with them. Something about me being in the past. Something about what was written in the letter her mother couldn't get over. It feels like everyone just forgets or moves on. Including me. I play our music (specifically our song). I used to get drunk and prêtend to dance with her. I know weird. I get it.  But now I play them and feel nothing. I used to go to where her ashes were sprayed (it was a special place for us as we would go there sometimes and just talk) I used to go there a lot after it happened and just talked with her. Again, you can judge me for being crazy if you want.  I recently went to that same spot and nothing. I thought about our time together and feel like I am remembering someone who isn't me (but of course is). Let alone who she was at that time. I haven't thought about her in months. I used to dream about growing old with this women and now I struggle to even picture a face. I went into a bit of a hoe phase aftwards and every time I got laid it felt like I was cheating. Now, I don't emotionaly connected with women as my brain likes to go into defensive mode. Long story. Pretty self explanatory. The feelings of betrayal and 'im cheating' is gone and I hate it. I hate it takes me months to remember her. I hate that she is gone. I hate that my life has just seemed to move on. Like the world didn't realise it lost a good one. It feels like we have just forgotten her. Like she didn't exist. Like I didn't get my heart broken. Like she didn't take my dream of being a footballer with her. She would drive me to all my practices and support me from the sidelines. Shed bring a new sign to every game. She even turned up to some of my training sessions and cheered. After she went, playing didn't feel the same. I also took a bad injury which didn't allow me to compete... I'm rambling. I hate that when she was here I had a dream and a carrier and knew what I wanted to do with my life and now that she's been gone. I don't. And it's been 7 years. 7 dam years. I should have some kind of idea. (Yes I have a carrier and hobbies. I'm not a bum... but nothing like it was back then. I was driven. I just go to work to go to work now.) When it first happened I was angry and burnt/deleted all of our photos separate and together. All the presents she gave to me, I sold, donating the money to suicidal awareness. Which looking back on, I needed and should have kept at least some of that money... I did a lot of stupid shit when she left. So I can't look back on those. I have been through my own battles with suicide (and surprisingly won) and fixed my life up partially. I'm not here for sympathy or any 'im sorry' messages. Or the 'you just got ptsd' ones or the 'congratulations on improving your life' ones. I have had too many of them already. It feels like the world has moved on and doesn't give a shit. No one asks about her anymore. Or how I feel. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it shouldn't. I get I'm always going to feel sad about what happened. I get people just don't ask about past events, especially such emotional ones...questions... What do you do when the rest of the world has seemed to forget the person ever existed? How do you remember or honour someone who been gone for soo long? A person you hardly remember or picture...I tried bringing in her anavsary with a friend that never knew her and it felt weird. He was only there for me and the alcohol.How do you go about remembering someone you find hard to remember yourself? I feel so alone when her anavsary comes around. I don't know how or what I'm suppose to do on her anaversary. As I age is she going to just become some distant memory? I don't know how comfortable I feel with that.

1b0uck2;Do they not wonder about who is going to find them ...?;silentgardeneel;I lost my younger sister a little over a week ago.We both studied in the same city, but lived a 45 min public transport trip apart. We met up every other weekend or so, and didn't text much in the meantime. It was usually me who initiated meetings to get lunch, go shopping, watch a movie sometimes. But we were close. She cared about me a lot and so did I about her. She was deeply depressed, I knew that, but not to what extent.As I now know is not uncommon, she seemed to get better in the past weeks before her passing. Tried out new sports, ate healthier than before, we had some plans for an event in June, there were still games coming out I thought we both were excited about.My birthday was not even a week before she must have done it.I suspect she did it on Valentines day. I found her a few days later, on the 17th. She hadn't replied to my messages and didn't return calls, so I went to check on her.I called the paramedics and didn't go in myself, but the day was no less traumatic because of it. Standing in front of her door and having the worst feeling, calling her name and already suspecting. I already started wondering about what I'd wear to the funeral while I was still walking down the street to her apartment complex. Why did my brain do that.And why did my sister not consider that most likely, I'd be the one to realize she is missing. Our parents live two hours away from our city by car, not too far, but they'd ask me to check on her even if they had noticed first. She didn't have any friends in our city, just online far away. I was the only person she consistently met up with...I keep wondering if this was a sign, a message to me to punish me for being a selfish sister at times. But her fridge was full of my favourite chocolates... several bars. I saw it when we cleaned out her fridge two days ago. I had mentioned I'd like there to be smth for me to snack on next time I come over to watch anime with her, that last time was Jan 15...There was so much chocolate for me.I just don't understand her and that hurts too. I don't want to second guess what I thought was a really close sister bond, but now I wonder if she secretly hated me? It sounds so stupid to even write out. She showered me in gifts on my birthday.

1b0ld2q;Abandoned by everyone ;LadedaLorinne;It's coming up on almost 4 months since my long term boyfriend shot himself in the head right in front of me with no warning. He was a long term alcoholic that was always trying to recover but anyone who knows addition, understands that battle. It was my first day at my new job, which he pushed for me to get. It was actually at the same place that he had been employed for 8 months. The switch was based on better work/ life balance for the two of us, having a similar schedule so we can spend more time together, and me being less stressed so I could enjoy my time outside of work. I got home, he was asking me about my first day as we started heating up food for dinner. I had leftovers from eating out together the night before, and he put a lasagna in the oven. We shared a left over croissant, he gave me a kiss in-between questions, and then he walked away to his computer room and came back with his gun. That's when he did it.The trauma is unreal. The abandonment has been even worse. Not only did he leave me all alone in this world we built together, but he left me financially stranded. His life insurance policy was left to his mother and his family has refused to help me at all since it happened. They want all of his belongings and tend to forget what he was in my life. They took almost everything from me that was my comfort. Then I had to move out of the house we lived in together because I could not afford it alone. I had nothing. My own family has been so unsupportive and lacks basic empathy for the situation. I have been forced to move into a bedroom of a house with a stranger, behind on all my bills, depressed beyond comprehension, and I have to do it all alone. I can't believe the person who I supported through their addiction left me like this. I feel like a piece of trash left out on the curb that no one wants to deal with. It takes everything for me to get through each day. The thoughts never stop. The day replays like a high definition video over and over again. I just want to be able to make it in life but everything is aimed against me and I feel like no one wants to see me succeed.;It's coming up on almost 4 months since my long term boyfriend shot himself in the head right in fro;;13;36;2024-02-26 16:14:55;2024-02-26;Monday;16:14:55;2128;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:13.108404

1azn5v9;Can anyone else please discuss their experience with memory and memory loss potentially after trauma? ;makingbutter2;Im specifically about 1.5 years out since my mother passed away.  My morning shift coworker I’m sure thinks my work performance is poor.  Sad thing is I’ve been there 3 years and he’s the new guy 😩. My mother died. Then the estate took about a year. Then I had to have my mother’s pet put down this last holiday season. My therapist said, “ don’t be surprised if you start having memory issues” because I’m coming out of fight or flight for so long. So as far I’m concerned there was mom’s death, the estate, pet euthanasia, and I just finished painting the interior of the home myself this month February.   All of this is tied to my mother’s suicide.  I’m just at the point where I can check mark off ok two huge projects done ✔️ today is 2/25.  So really just 2 weeks down even though people moved on with their life months ago. Anyway my memory I feel is like crap.  I work at a hotel and I forgot to do my cash drop till last minute.

1azh3mt;Retraumatized;QuirkyLength6140;"I am marking this as NSFW simply because the image that is now burned into my brain is NSFW and I feel like any description may upset others...so, there's your warning. It's been 3 weeks since my person left this world and today I decided to go for a walk in the park where he shot himself. I believe that you can get closure (some or all) from going to places of trauma and sitting with whatever emotions, energies, etc. that you feel in that space (I did similar with my own father's death - my first job out of grad school was in a local ER and one of the MDs had suggested I go sit in the trauma room where he died during a lull in the overnight action. My dad died when I was a little kid so it was an experience I can't really explain besides I was able to explain to my inner child what happened in that room and I was able to use my adult knowledge to finally grasp that everything really had been tried to keep him alive and that my mom and grandma absolutely had to make the final decisions they did after all else failed). Anyway. I went for a walk in the park because it was sunny and kids were out playing and I just needed to get outside. Plus, closure. I knew the general area where my friend died so I walked around all the other areas of the park instead. However I found myself slowly drifting in that direction and finally was like ""Okay, it's been 3 weeks. It's rained and snowed in that period of time. Plus, you don't exactly know where and should be fine as long as you stay on the trail."" So, over I drifted and I did stay on the trail and watched a herd of deer wake up for their afternoon snack, squirrels running around like crazy, and there were even some cardinals up in the trees. One of them was exceptionally bright, so I watched it swoop down to hop around on the ground when I noticed the ground was markedly different in color and texture where it'd just hopped, just about 10 feet off the path. It was the spot. I knew it as soon as I took a few steps towards it and smelled that smell - if you've ever smelled old blood/an older deceased body (I unfortunately have w/ my line of work), even roadkill, you'll know the smell. I didn't walk any closer but noticed there was still clear evidence of him there - clotted, slimy cerebrospinal fluid mixed with blood and other matter and leaves that were still slick with rust/black colored blood. There was also a bit of tree bark at about the 5-6' level that was chipped off that would be consistent with an exit trajectory. I wanted to vomit because it made it all that much more real (he was cremated so it's been easy to trick myself into not believing the walnut shoe box on a pedestal wasn't ""him""). But also because this is a public park and it's, just, there. Wouldn't the Medical Examiner and/or my city's EMS clean that up? As I mentioned, kids play in the park and people have their dogs out off leash all the time - especially in the trail areas where he was (people describe it as ""woods"" but it's not really - there's a pond with a path around it and then some trees every 7 or so feet before the trails lead to baseball diamonds). I just couldn't believe that there was this 2'x3' soaked in but viscous puddle still there in the mud/grass with death stench wafting off it. Looking around, I took in what his last sights would have been and that, combined with the spot, just bummed me out even more. He got to look at a beautiful park in the middle of the city that he spent a ton of time in with his kid when his kid was a toddler and the police station only 300 feet away, which is why he must have hid behind the tree and hoped no one would hear his shot or see him once he fell - it seemed to work since it wasn't until the next day he was found. And then I started to get really upset - sad, angry, panicked. Like, it's awful that he's gone - and right in the middle of everything but also hidden from everything...but then to just leave all that behind, too? I don't know, it just feels disrespectful and irresponsible. I want to take a bottle of bleach over there and dump it all around but with my luck, I'll end up killing the aforementioned wildlife and make things even worse. A city worker was out and I found myself asking him if he could ""deal with all that"" and he walked right over and said oh, that they had put a tarp and a log on top of the spot and had just taken it off today, hoping it'd soak everything up (Is this science I have never heard of??) but that he'd talk to his manager as the tarp-log approach had only preserved the spot and that the smell would start attracting ""things."" I found myself getting angry at the fact that he was more concerned about animals/vermin and not that my friend's literal life was still there all over the ground. I didn't yell and didn't take my anger out on him, I just said thanks and that I'd really appreciate it. It all just really upset me. I know he didn't do it in front of me and I didn't find his actual body. I know it's not as bad as it could be - but man it's still bad, and I've seen some serious shit in my life.

1azci6j;Today is “officially” 7 years;homeostasis555;If someone reads even a bit of this that’s cool, but I just need to write somewhere & feel connected. I feel so disconnected from others. Only my partner & mom acknowledged my sisters death.TW: Hanging, coma My (life-long foster) sister hung herself. She was found 30 minutes later and went to the hospital. She was then in a coma for days until her biological mother decided to pull the plug.I know it was the right decision because even if my sister came out of it, I know she would not be the same due to the neurological damage those 30 minutes did to her.I really can’t believe it’s been 7 years. I wasn’t given access to the way I wanted to grieve in the beginning. Since we weren’t biologically related, I was blocked out. Her biological mom felt negatively towards the mother who raised us together for so many years. She wouldn’t let me into the home to gather anything. Even a shirt would’ve been nice. At the funeral there were all these boards of photos with friends & family and none of them included me/our foster family. Nobody asked me for pictures. We weren’t sat with the family section (which was fine, but just felt like another dig that I wasn’t her “real family” despite living over a decade together as minors and a lot of time together, willingly, as adults).I know I am not owed anything, but that aftermath really complicated my grief. I really can’t believe it’s been 7 years. I started today well and as time passed I kept getting sadder and sadder. Tearing up or intrusive thoughts but kept it pushing. I am finally having a (needed) big cry. Sending love to you all.;If someone reads even a bit of this that’s cool, but I just need to write somewhere & feel connected;;19;50;2024-02-25 02:16:55;2024-02-25;Sunday;02:16:55;1596;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:13.122999

Why didn't you give us any clear sign?Out of anyone, I would have been able to understand how badly you were doing and helped if you had told me how serious it was getting, or so I tell myself.I always thought if one of us left the world by choice, it would be me. You knew how close I was to it once. I never told you how serious it was but I know you saw the tabs on my ipad. I'm still ashamed I forgot to close them before asking you to watch something with me. But I couldn't bring myself to do it, in part because I had a therapist I could never lie to, and in part because I thought it'd ruin your life forever, and my mental health issues already ruined our family and burdened you enough, didn't it?I thought if anyone in our family would ever commit, it would be me. Honestly, I think everyone agrees. When mom told our grandparents that night, they both thought she misspoke and meant me.But I am the one who found you. I am the one who noticed you hadn't gotten my messages from the night before, that your phone had been turned off for at least a day already, the one who drove to your place and rang the doorbell of all neighbors and called the ambulance when nobody opened. I am the one who called our parents that night, and who helped clean up today even what the police left in the middle of the room without warning, and who has to write your speech tomorrow.It's not fair that you died. It's not fair that this whole time everyone worried about me including myself, while you were so much more desperate than me.I wish I could tell you how sorry I am that I didn't see. Even though you tried to tell me. I was busy with my own issues again as I've always been and you were overlooked, not taken serious enough, and it didn't help that you never liked burdening anyone else with your issues.It's not fair that the one who you comforted lives, while the one who always gave their all to be there for me is...It's not fair they call me brave when really you were always so much braver.I am trying so hard to make amends by making the last ceremony as beautiful as can be but I am so exhausted and a letter would have meant so much. Why didn't you leave anything? Was it a decision of the moment thing? Just a ""I am sorry"" or ""I didn't do it because you burdened me with your relationship issues and ocd and anxiety"" would have been enough for me. But nope.

I can't focus on school, giving in half assed assignments, leaving so many fucking people on delivered for days or weeks, so relationships are getting strained. I can't even sustain conversation sometimes. and sex becoming a coping mechanism of sorts doesn't help.my perception of love is twisted as well. because i realised that he was the only one who actually showed that he loved me. as painful and grueling as it was. but it was toxic, a trauma bond, and my mood was always dependent on how he was doing or whether or not he was safe. especially recently, a lot of things have been reminding me of him, and I'm finding myself crying in class a lot more. it doesn't help that I'm studying to work in the social care field, so talking about suicide prevention or how to recognise it isn't an unusual topic for discussion.

1ayrj09;I believe that the cleanup persons stole my son’s personal belongings.;Gold_Bite_2237;UPDATE: I prematurely assumed that crime scene cleanup had something to do with taking my son’s belongings. Since my original post, we have talked with the cleanup crew several times and they have been as helpful as they could possibly be. They even provided the pictures that they took when they were there for the cleanup proving that my son’ s belongings were definitely in his apartment at that time. The company owner took the initiative to call the police himself and the crew all gave statements. I hate that I doubted them in the beginning due to the shady property manager’s behavior.Last week, the property manager (after completely dodging our calls) finally contacted my husband to tell us that there was a “misunderstanding” and that the maintenance men thought that they were supposed to clean out the apartment (despite being told TWICE by crime scene cleanup that it was NOT a full clean out ). So they had the missing items in their storage shed. My husband went with the police to pick up the items - which were all thrown into trash bags by the men who stole them. We were able to recover all but one item that we know for sure was missing.As of today, felony theft charges have been brought against one of the maintenance men (who admitted to taking the items) and charges are in process of being brought against the second (language barrier with the second). We plan to deal with the property management company in civil court as well. I am so thankful that I am now able to share these belongings with my son’s best friends and loved ones. I know they are just things, but they are a part of my son and it was so important to me to give these things to the people he loved most. And I am extremely grateful that these thieves will now have to live the rest of their lives with a felony record.ORIGINAL POST:Let me begin by saying I’m quite sure I’m still in shock. My son took his life on February 8, 2024. We discovered today when packing his property that several items are missing. Of course, due to the nature of his death, crime scene photos were taken. We have verified with the police that the missing items are pictured in the photos. A crime scene cleanup crew was brought in by the property management company the week after he died. The funeral was held out of town and we are just now getting into the apartment to begin removing his belongings (property manager refused entry until after cleanup). Today we realized that several  items are missing from his apartment, no signs of break in, door was locked, etc. My husband filed a police report.I know his things won’t bring him back to us. But they were his and during the worst imaginable event of our lives, just the thought of people rummaging through his entire home and taking whatever they wanted  adds another layer to this nightmare that I never thought possible. I’m just wondering if anyone else has dealt with anything like this and what you did if so.;UPDATE: I prematurely assumed that crime scene cleanup had something to do with taking my son’s belo;;43;78;2024-02-24 10:34:35;2024-02-24;Saturday;10:34:35;2949;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:13.127616
1ayoi37;I post a lot in this sub but it brings me comfort. ;yeetedbacon;I (f23) don’t know if anyone can relate but it’s nice to be in this subreddit. I lost my brother (m14) to suicide last October and it brings me a level of comfort knowing other people are going through similar situations. I miss my brother so much, he was my best friend and i will forever miss hanging out with him. We would play video games, watch YouTube, movies or spend hours on the phone talking about random things and sometimes I would just sit there and listen to him talk about what he’s doing at school or his plans for the weekend. I miss him everyday and when he died he took a part of me with him that I will never get back. Sometimes I catch myself going to call him then realise he won’t pick up. The last thing he ever said to me was a text message he sent on the night he took his life. He said “you’re the best sister ever”. It was short but it’s something I will never forget and it’s also painful to think that one of the last things he did was text me. I just really miss my best friend and brother. I don’t have any other siblings he was my only brother but he was all I needed.  It’s also so hard to think that someone so young could carry so much pain. He was only 14. He had barely lived, no 14 year old should ever go through what he went through. He was so private in his struggles. He struggled with his sexuality and identity and never told anyone..ultimately it killed him. I myself am queer and he knew that, early last year he came out to me as bi-sexual and I was obviously supportive of it and said that there’s no pressure for him to come out to our parents and he can do that in his own time. But what I didn’t know is how deep rooted those problems were for him. It’s like he couldn’t accept it himself. I kick myself everyday just thinking why he didn’t come to me about his problems. I would’ve got him the help he needed. I’m sorry for the long tangent but it feels good to get my story out there.;I (f23) don’t know if anyone can relate but it’s nice to be in this subreddit.

1aym7z1;Writing to deal with grief;Money_Freedom_6568;I wrote this vignette after my friend committed. We weren't very close at the time, and it breaks my heart that I didn't know how he was, and honestly hadn't for awhile, until my best friend called me to tell me that he had shot himself. I was boarding a plane back to my hometown to visit for spring break when I got the call, and this is one vivid memory I have, I've lost a lot of them due to dissociation even though it was only a year ago. The day after his passing, my childhood friends and I bought flowers to take to his family. I think about him a lot, and have been struggling since his death. Especially now that he should've been turning seventeen soon, and for the first time I'll be older than him. I'm not religious but I hope that he might be happy somewhere. Miss you.Paper straws pop through lids while ice dances in clear cups. Soft jazz and the buzz of tattooed baristas fills the café. Conversation built solely on nostalgia bounces around the table like a foosball. Why would we want to talk about today? We laugh, recalling childish fun, but it tastes a little sour. We wouldn't be sitting here together if bad things hadn’t happened. But we still smile and scribble on napkins with black gel pens. The reflection of sunlight through the windows projects golden silhouettes across our table. They sit next to us and listen silently as we travel back in time to trading halloween candy and biking to each other's houses when they were just streets away. When we wanted to have double sleepovers and secretly watch scary movies. When those were the only things that kept us up at night. Old memories trickle down the drain. The pause is filled with the once mute ghosts. They have become overwhelmingly loud. Our drinks dwindle down to drops, and we pile in the car. We write notes in the back seat, tucking colorful slips of paper stacked with words of love and grief into our pockets as we pull into the lot. Baby’s breath, roses and lilies roll across the belt as the cashier smiles at us. We stare at our shoes, but she asks questions anyway. “These flowers are so beautiful! What are you girls buying these for?” Her eyes well up with our answer. We tuck our messages gently between silky white petals approaching the ghostly house, pristine bricks, carefully clipped palms and sparkly memories. The sun shines down on us in the driveway, but somehow it feels ice cold. The grass reaches above our ankles as we lay our flowers down to rest. Nothing could make this beautiful house any sadder. Our prayers leave our hearts in silence, and our eyes in tears. It’s hard to imagine a heaven in this cloudless sky, but I hope it’s there. I hope he’s there.;I wrote this vignette after my friend committed.

1ayldtm;Playing detective is exhausting;cht97;My brother took his life on Feb 5. He was only 24. He didn’t leave a note or anything. He was depressed but so private, we had no idea how badly it was. He had actually stopped drinking alcohol in the month of December for over a month and seemed really happy lately. The night before he took his life, he had around 6-8 beers which was the most he had in a long time. Whenever he’d drink alcohol, the next day he’d hate himself and became really dark. More than “just a hangover”. My mind won’t stop playing detective and it’s exhausting but I can’t stop. I’ve gone thru his MacBook and iPhone after spending hours unlocking them to find nothing. I’ve searched his room and did find a few depressing things but nothing recent. My mind is jumping 24/7 - was this planned? Was it impulsive? Did he wake up mad that he drank the night before? Was it just a bad hangover because he also didn’t eat the day before, coming off shift work? Was it planned? I don’t know how I’m suppose to live the rest of my life without these answers.

He left no note but did send me a text right beforehand and wouldn’t answer my return calls (I was out of town at the time). I knew his marriage to my step mom wasn’t great, but I had no idea the pain he was in.. And just like that he was gone.On one hand, he was a pretty amazing person. We had a lot of fun together while I was growing up. Lots of fishing, and he worked his ass off to make sure we could spend time together after he and my mom got divorced. I have always appreciated that and have a lot of respect and admiration for his work ethic and priorities in life. I’m also proud to say that I have his sense of humor. I feel very fortunate to have had the time I did with him, and I’ll cherish those memories forever.On the other hand, what the actual fuck man. You’ve missed everything. You missed my wedding. You were supposed to be my best man. You’ll never get to meet my wife. You missed getting to hear that you’re going to be a grandpa. You’re missing your granddaughter being born and you will never get to know her. She will never have the privilege of getting to know you. And you chose this, you did this, and I fucking hate that. I’ve had points where I’ve hated you for what you did. I’ve had points of understanding. I’ve had points of not caring. I’ve had points of denial and utter devastation. To anyone going through this process of grieving, please know you’re not alone. The pain comes and goes.

My younger siblings who don’t live here are still convinced it was a heart attack. It’s not. There was a note, there were other things that made it very obvious that he followed through with a plan, and planned this over a matter of days.

But he was still my rock underneath it all.I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know how to feel this. I don’t know how to describe to anyone that I’m angry, feel guilt, and also have immense feelings of relief at the same time. The relief is hard for others to grasp. I feel so sick.

1axx72p;Struggling with anxiety and fear or abandonment following my mums suicide nearly 2 years ago;Jb77119;My mum took her life in April 2022, leaving no note or goodbye following a very hard year with her mental health during which I had practically no relationship with her.I coped suprisngly well for the first year and a bit, think I had so much going on with life my body didn’t let me process everything. These last 4-6 months have been really hard, I’ve developed anxiety out of nowhere. Started having panic attacks and mild symptoms of agoraphobia. I find leaving the town I live in terrifying, staying away from home terrifies me and just generally find life anxiety inducing and scary. I also find myself constantly overthinking the past and the future, particularly having intense fears of abandonment and being alone. I’m so scared of my girlfriend of 5 years one day leaving me because I don’t know how I’d cope without her. Think after losing my mum seemingly out of nowhere one day it makes you worry that anybody could just leave one day and there’s nothing you could do to stop it.I’m having therapy and trying to work on all these issues, but it’s hard and overwhelming at times.

1axr1fh;It feels so unreal;xSuccukittyx;"My dad hung himself a day ago. I've never lost anyone to suicide before. Any time I hear a male voice at the door; a police officer or family friend offering condolences, for a second my brain thinks it's my dad stopping by and I get ready to run downstairs  until I remember he is gone. I just want to ignore everything and hide in my room.  I've been hiding away from people's attempts to visit and feel scared of the funeral and not being able to hide away from everything anymore. For now I haven't cried in front of anyone except my cat and quickly wipe away my tears when I hear my mom coming.I keep feeling guilty too. A few weeks ago my dad stopped up to talk to my mom. I couldn't hear much but from what little I did hear I had a sudden drop in my stomach and thought something bad was going to happen. I quickly ran downstairs to give my dad a hug as he was already leaving out the door. I did get to hug him one more time but it hurts thinking was he not going to hug me one more time or say goodbye in person? Did he not want to see his daughter one more time? I brushed away my anxiety about something bad happening away at the time because I overreact and misread things alot.

1axn22q;Our bodies are designed to survive…;Ok-River5817;Think about it, every cell in our body is working to protect and sustain our lives. We self protect, self preserve, fight off foreign bodies and all without us even thinking about it. So when someone loses the will to live and would rather self destruct- we as a society must pause for a second and grasp what is really happening. Why do cancer patients receive more compassion? When someone dies by suicide they have died by a ‘cancer’ of their thoughts…every day gets worse, the thoughts multiply at an alarming rate…if left untreated ( and the treatments are way more complex than chemotherapy) they eventually perform the ultimate act of self harm- they’ve reached a point of so much agony and pain that suicide is their last ditch effort to stop the spread. The more suicide remains a stigma, the less we can openly and honestly discuss what our loved ones have gone through…no matter how sane they appeared to be, no matter how rational and level headed their notes sounded, no matter how functional they appeared to be at work, how happy they seemed- I truly 100% believe that every single person who dies by suicide (except the obvious few) were very sick. My husband wasn’t not some guy who just couldn’t handle a little stress, or that committed the ultimate sin, or that whose funeral arrangements have to be rushed because you don’t want the shame he brings to ruin your family name. He was kind, loyal, passionate always wanted the best for everyone. He was just sick and lost his will to live that day, went against biology.I just want us to get over this stigma- because if we don’t it will just continue to destroy more lives.Thanks for listening- in the real world no one understands.;Think about it, every cell in our body is working to protect and sustain our lives.

1axjzqg;It's been 4 weeks today ;Carofine88;"Four weeks ago today I found him.Four weeks ago today I was wearing the same shirt I am wearing now. It's one of his.The night before he was half amused and half annoyed I was wearing it. I'd wear all his shirts because they're like dresses on me. He had just brought this one. He said you can only wear it if you can tell me the character on the front. I can't remember my answer but it was wrong, he laughed and corrected me. I still can't remember who the character is. I woke up with a bad feeling four weeks ago today. I just knew. I opened the garage door and first thought he was standing there. Then I realized he wasn't, he was hanging by his neck. Our son's were standing behind me. They're 8 & 5. I shielded them, they didn't see. But they heard my screaming for god knows how long. Fifteen minutes? 20 minutes? Longer? I raced them to the neighbours. I came back to see if it wasn't too late. It was too late. He was ice cold. His eyes were open looking towards the door. His beautiful bright blue eyes. His feet weren't off the ground. They were out in front of him. He just sat into his noose.Took off his apple watch.Flattened a box underneath him. He was still wearing his shoes. The first thing I noticed when I opened the door was the smell. I smelt it before when my step father died of a pulmonary embolism at home. So I knew. We've survived four weeks. The stress has been debilitating. Living purely off adrenaline. Eating is a struggle. I look like I've aged a decade. But I don't care. But I know how worried he'd be if he saw me right now. He came to me the other night. The kids sleep with me in my bed, both wrapped tightly on either side. I was wide awake. I can't sleep without a light on now. I turned to face my eldest son when I saw so many dim lights come together at the end of the bed in an already lit room take his shape, then when his shape appeared, he appeared and was just looking at me. He looked more than at peace and happy, he looked vibrant, full of the universe. He walked closer to the bedside table towards our son, and each step he took his face changed, it got younger. And then he disappeared.I wanted to say don't go.I wasn't even surprised or shocked to see him.I felt nothing, no fear, no happiness, no peace. Just maybe grateful he visited. But the anger and rage I carry for the burden our son's carry. The sadness and brokenness I feel that they no longer have a dad.The brokenness I feel he felt so broken. There isn't a memory I can find of my adult life that doesn't have him in every corner.He struggled for years. He said for years it was a fight to be here every day.His dad did it too. But he was 21. He knew the burden it held over his life. And now the burden has been passed on. The complete emptiness I feel is difficult to describe. The multiple times a day thinking ""I'll call him"" or ""he is going to find this funny"", then a body slam of emotions hitting like a Mac truck remembering my reality. I don't know how we've survived. I don't know how we will survive. I just want to fast forward my life to the end. Hopefully it's when my sons are grown and independent, strong, resilient men. It's so fucking unfair. Apart of me died with him. That's probably the best way to describe it.I feel dead.But I have a responsibility to our sons. So I have to show up.It's so complex. So many things and people to blame. So much emotion. So much emptiness and no emotion. The waves are the sizes of tsunamis. So much anxiety. So much wanting to block the pain. So much keeping busy. I used to be so afraid of dying. Now I welcome it. But only, only when my sons are grown.Their tragedy possibly can't be doubled.

1axiysh;I’m angry with friends/family. I feel so alone in my loss (how bout you?);Mierkatte;I lost a loved one who was very dear to me. I imagined we’d have so much more time together. My loss (I guess) is deemed as “secondary” as I am the aunt. But my loved one and I shared conversations of struggle. And we talked openly and honestly. In a way that I have never had with any of my siblings. I just feel really lonely in my loss. Of course I’m 100% available to my sister (my loved one’s mother) and my loved one’s brothers. But the rest of my family — my siblings — are just completely silent (e.g. one sibling sent me a valentines card in the midst of the aftermath, a few weeks later, no mention of our loved one and our shared loss).I feel like I don’t know my family of origin. My father is deceased. My mom is in advanced stage dementia. All the sibling relationships are so fragmented. All my siblings are scattered across the states. There was no shared funeral. Or shared grieving. They don’t return texts or emails. I was the only sibling who showed up to help my sister, be present to spread the ashes of her son, etc. It just feels so wrong. Like my whole entire family didn’t show up for my nephew, for my sister, their family. I hold so much anger. And feel such loneliness. It’s making me bitter. And making me isolate.I’m angry with friends to whom I’ve bore my loss to. Explained my sadness to. Shared about my relationship to my loved one. And this is one response (I rec’d a text from a friend who said):I feel so sad for you. Question: are you available to work?Idk. I just question humanity. And wonder, Who the fuck am I related to? Who the fuck are these people I’ve been calling “friend”?(Back to family rant) It breaks my heart for my nephew. For my sister. In the worst imaginable tragedy people don’t show up. They behave so callus. So removed. I just don’t want to spend energy on those who can’t open their heart. I see how they behave and how all their children are witnessing their behavior. And that they might accept or witness that as the norm.I do know this has changed me forever. My perspective. My goals. Who with and how I spend my time. It also makes me incredibly attuned to and feel connected to suffering and the people who are willing to show up with their hearts.Can anyone relate?;I lost a loved one who was very dear to me.

Other times, I just can’t even acknowledge it without breaking down.I’ll come across a letter she wrote me, or just hear a song from a band we saw together, and I’m just ruined.My husband has to Google every single tv show or film that we watch to see if it has any mention of suicide (I didn’t know he was doing this). The one time he didn’t, someone died in the same way she did and I was absolutely broken.Today, I was at work and someone went off on a tangent and started talking about suicide. I’ll obviously ALWAYS think of her now when I hear that word, but today I got so angry - how dare you talk about suicide? When I’ve been through what I’ve been through? And am actively hurt and heartbroken?But the reality is - I’ve never met this guy before and he knows nothing about me. On the face of it, I know my feelings were irrational. But here I am feeling like he was just so awful, and I’m on the train home fighting back tears. I know it’s completely irrational.Other times? This kind of thing hasn’t touched me.I know this is a lot of words, but I’m a bit lost and don’t really feel I can talk about this openly with people in my life. We’re all hurting.Do things start to get a bit more normal? A bit more linear? I miss her so much, my heart aches when I think about the pain she was in and her last moments.

1axa4kn;PTSD due to my 14 year old brothers suicide ;yeetedbacon;Hi I (f23) have recently been diagnosed with ptsd due to trauma I experienced surrounding my brother’s suicide. Last October my beautiful baby brother committed suicide in the middle of the night. In the early morning of October 29th a family member called me and told me he is going to be picking me up because someone serious had happened. He wouldn’t tell me what was going on but I knew it was about my brother because I had gotten a weird text from my brother the night before. When I had got to my dad’s house he was out the front crying and his face was puffy and red like he had been crying non stop. For context I have only ever seen my dad cry maybe twice in my entire life. Anyway I ran up to him and asked him what’s going on. He said that my brothers dead. That he killed himself. I went into shock. I actually didn’t cry for the first day I found out because I was in such a state of shock…I relive that entire day everytime I wake up. I hear the cry’s of agony from family members, I relive having to call up members of my family and having to tell them the news. I remember calling my best friend and pleading and begging with him asking him what I’m meant to do with my life now that my baby brothers dead. I remember walking into my brothers room and seeing my dad in the fetal position crying and sobbing for his son. I remember the police coming to the house and questioning me. I remember reading the note that my brother had left for me and my parents. I remember staying over at my dad’s that first night and not sleeping and hearing my parents wail and cry. I remember having to go to the funeral home the next day to discuss what is happening to my brothers body and pleading with the funeral home to get my brothers body out of police custody so my parents can see there son one last time. When will it end. The flashbacks.

1awmzsy;My worst fear is that he didn’t mean to. ;Pycharming;My brother killed himself back in October. He suffered from schizoaffective disorder and had started hearing voices last year. He had several persistent delusions that he was the devil, anti christ, possessed by demons. He had made several attempts last year, listening to command voices, but the final attempt was very different. His previous times had all been with pills. He also had been caught googling how to die quickly via car accident. No one expected the way he choose to go since he was clearly still avoidant of pain. The failed attempts maybe fed into the delusion that he was immortal, so perhaps he felt he needed desperate measures. Late on October 12th, the night before Friday the 13th, my brother doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire. He was found and evacuated to a hospital in a different state because he had burns on 90% of his body. Even the burn center who treated him said that the worst case they had seen survive was 70%. He passed the next day. I just think the worst part is that he could not have made this decision clearly. He had been dealing a swift painless death and instead suffered hours of some the worst pain conceivable. I just hope that shock and the pain meds prevented him from feeling the worst of it. But I do fear that he was so deluded that he didn’t just not consider the pain, but thought he could survive , and be rid of his “demons”. The timing of it is not lost on me either. Is it bad that I hope he truly wanted to die?;My brother killed himself back in October.

1awmn77;Painful reminder;No-Instruction-5159;Today, I came across an article about how the suicide prevention net was completed on the Golden State Bridge. I read an article that chronicled people who both supported the construction of the net, and those who opposed it. I believe that some have well intentioned criticisms. However, the article had another quote about someone who felt the net desecreted the beauty of the historical landmark. That last opposition stung. In my own grief of losing my baby brother, I have so palpably felt other’s discomfort with my grief-ridden reality. I’ve felt pushed and boxed away, as if my reality was too painful for others to even acknowledge. That opposition to a wire netting that’s barely visible from far away reminded me of those feelings of being pushed aside for other’s comfort. Even the smallest public visual reminder of the pain and tragedy of suicide is too uncomfortable for some.;Today, I came across an article about how the suicide prevention net was completed on the Golden Sta;;3;9;2024-02-21 20:37:11;2024-02-21;Wednesday;20:37:11;891;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:13.213948

1awe12n;Advice on where to donate ;siphontits;My younger brother passed in April of 2022 and in a state of shock and confusion we made a gofund me for his funeral. Looking back I’m always confused why we did this because my parents had money to pay for it but I think my sister and I did it kind of as a way to let people know about his passing. I remember people were starting to comment things on his instagram about him being gone and it angered me that people were like admitting that he was dead when we had only just found him, it was confusing on how people were finding out idk. I regretted making the gofundme almost immediately. I wish we would’ve just made a memorial post announcing his funeral but I also try not to blame myself for this things I while did in the shock of grief. Anyway, we used the money to pay for his funeral and a memorial bench in a park near our house but since then I have just had the money sitting in an envelope. Our plan was always to donate the extra money but I’ve been so stressed that I won’t give it to the right cause and for some reason that really stresses me out. So moral of the post- does anyone have any recommendations? I feel like AFSP is such a big thing that I worry his money won’t really go to a helping someone. He was a really really talented artist, he was a really good writer and often talked about wanting to write shows or movies when he got older, he LOVED kids, and was very passionate about advocating for LGBTIQA+. Are there any things or programs that I could donate to relating to those things? Like maybe an art program that’s brought to kids or something? We thought about donating movies to the residential hospital that he stayed in a few times because he said they only had like two movies. Would that be a good idea? Any ideas are appreciated, thanks guys <3;My younger brother passed in April of 2022 and in a state of shock and confusion we made a gofund me;;2;2;2024-02-21 14:57:24;2024-02-21;Wednesday;14:57:24;1790;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:13.223990

I consider this a blessing, as well as my close friends that have helped me chart a course to a more productive life. I can’t tell you all how much you have all helped me. Everyone should have at least one true best friend.. mine is the best I ever had.”I will never know why he did what he did, and it hurts.

1avxugw;My dad committed suicide yesterday.;peeta_is_useless;I said this in a grief group, and somebody told me I should join here too. I just needed to talk about it.Yesterday, 2/19, my dad killed himself. He went behind the dumpster in our yard and shot himself. Everyone was home. Our property is split, with one house on one side of the driveway and another on the other side. I’m 18 and I live in one house with my mom and younger brother, while my dad lived in the other with his fiancée and her son. No one saw this coming. We all heard the shot, but thought nothing of it because the neighbors shoot their guns all the time. His fiancée found him a couple hours later.He’s suffered from depression for a long time, but he’s always had a lot of people loving and supporting him. He was just such a likable guy. Everyone loved him so much. Even people that didn’t know him well. He was also very proud plus an alcoholic(sober for about 20 years) and took care of other people rather than letting them know he was hurting.It was the worst day of my life, standing out there with my family while the investigators and cops searched for the casing. They hadn’t even taken him yet- he was just covered up behind the dumpster still.It’s still the worst day of my life. I feel numb. I keep thinking I’m going to wake up from this nightmare and it never happens. I feel like I’m moving more slowly and I just can’t concentrate on anything. I can’t go ten minutes without crying. I’m not hungry. I feel sick and shaky.Since I’m his oldest and he wasn’t married at the time, I’m legally his next of kin. On Thursday we’re meeting with the funeral director and I have to give my consent to cremate him. It’s just a lot. I’m overwhelmed and confused.One minute I’m angry, then I’m feeling guilty for being angry, because I know my father. He would never do this unless he was hurting so bad. I’m glad he has peace now but it hurts so much and I just want my dad back.My brother, dad’s fiancée and I watched the hockey game yesterday after the cops left to think about something else. His favorite team broke their scoring record and he would have been so excited about it. We were supposed to watch it with him. The last time I talked to him, it was Sunday night about fudge. The last time I saw him, it was Saturday and he was helping me plan my summer trip. Last night, his fiancée brought me some books he got on Sunday for my trip- he didn’t get to show them to me himself.I just hope he knew how much I loved him but I can’t help but think I should have told him more. I was so close to him. I was like a mini, female copy of him. I love him so much. It feels so messed up that life goes on around us, but his family has to start over and figure out how to live without him.Edit- he left a note with sections for his fiancée, my brother and I, and his parents. I haven’t gotten to read it yet because the cops took it, but his fiancée summarized it for us. I want to read it because it’s his last words to me, but at the same time, I’m scared to.Edit 2: Thank you to the commenters.

1avm6hk;Unable to be close to anyone now;Emotional-Day-4425;I (34F) don't know how to be close to anyone after my best friend (33F) committed suicide in 2022. I grew up with a very psychologically abusive mother and my father was never there due to being in the military. I experienced CSA at about 11 and since then had been in a pattern of violent relationships until I met my now husband about 7 years ago. Since abuse started so young I have always had trouble socializing (a lot of the things I struggle with present similarly to autism but it's expensive to get a diagnosis and I don't think it'd be all that helpful at this point so my therapist and I are just working on PTSD stuff). My best friend and I met when I was 13 or 14. It was my first day at a new school after moving and little did I know it was her first day there as well. She walked up to me like we had known each other for years and we had been inseparable ever since. She was the FIRST and ONLY  person I felt safe around in my entire life (until my husband). Because of how bad my relationship was with my own mother at the time, her mother took me in for a lot of my teenage years and raised me and I still call her mom so I think of my best friend more as a sister because she's the closest to family I've ever had. It felt like we were put here to look out for each other and we did. We always shared the ugliest parts of ourselves with each other. I blame myself a lot because I feel like I failed her in some way to make her feel like she couldn't tell me she was going to do this or was struggling. We also shared a heroin addiction which I got clean from in 2020 and she was attempting recovery shortly before she passed. Even though she wasn't clean I never cut her off (but did create boundaries), never judged (how could I? I had been in the same place.), and always encouraged her. I was so proud of her for getting into a sober living house, but now I feel like I left her behind when I got clean. I spend a lot of sleepless nights sort of going over every interaction we've had in over 20 years of friendship like a rolodex in my head trying to pinpoint where I failed and where I let her down. I have withdrawn pretty much completely from any social life and have no interest in it at this point. I think subconsciously I feel that I am completely unable to be close to anyone until I find where I let her down because I can't stand the thought of ever letting another person down in the same way. I also feel like I don't deserve to be loved again after what happened and almost like maybe I never did deserve to be loved in the first place. Because of addiction, almost everyone I used to be friends with and some exes are dead. I feel like some radioactive monster that destroys everything it touches. I feel that no one is better for having known me nor do I bring anything to the table. People have tried to love me through this loss and honestly they've been amazing, but I won't let them get too close or see my pain. Simply put, I love them too much to let them love me back or get too close. I was already in therapy when she died working on PTSD and doing EMDR which I've still continued. We've been trying to break this fundamental belief that had been instilled in me since childhood that I deserve less than everyone else. I had made progress before she died but now everything's gotten exponentially worse. If you've read this far, thank you for even caring enough to spend time doing that. If you're in this sub, I'm assuming you're also in an extraordinary amount of pain and I hope life brings you some peace and comfort. I don't even know what I hope to gain making this post, but any advice would be appreciated. It feels hopeless at this point. I can feel her absence in everything and it feels wrong to be separated from her, but I can't stand the thought of ever putting my husband in the same pain I'm currently in.;I (34F) don't know how to be close to anyone after my best friend (33F) committed suicide in 2022.

1av950x;I’m haunted by her blank stares;hangingdenim;I constantly find myself thinking of the many blank stares my sister had in the years leading up to her suicide. I recently saw a tiktok of a guy on his birthday right before he committed suicide, and I felt chilled to the bone because he had the same exact blank stare on his face that my sister would have.

1av6ojw;It’s my best friend’s birthday;ProlificPizza;It’s been a little over a year since she died. The second birthday without her. She never turned 30, like me. It’s weird that she’ll never get there. We always used to stress about getting to our 30s.In tribute, I drove around her hometown today, past the place she used to work, went to a spot she showed me years ago, ate at her favorite restaurant for lunch, and I felt ok. I thought maybe I was healing because I didn’t sob all day. It wasn’t until I settled down into bed a bit ago that it really hit me and I came unraveled. Her last words and the text I didn’t send days before her death still haunt me. I know I’ll never know what she was thinking in the moment, but damn do I wish I did. I miss her so much. I can’t believe we won’t grow older together and that I’ll never see her again. None of it feels real and it’s like I’m back at the start, emotionally. I don’t know what I hope to achieve with this post, but I had to put words out into the universe. Thank you for reading.;It’s been a little over a year since she died.

1av1r2z;Is it normal to stop living for a few years after it happens?;Guilty-Store-2972;My dad killed himself when I was 19, almost 4 years ago (Holy shit, does not feel like that long ago), and basically since it happened my entire life just kind of stopped. Things still happen but extremely slowly. I just kind of stopped, I guess because I disconnected from my emotions and other people. Basically spent most of those years doing nothing, I have felt unable to even make food or get out of bed for a long time. Its improved this year but still, it's hard to get back into doing. I have barely thought about him or processed him because it's just too much. I'm going to therapy and I decided today I'm going to start talking through the death, hopefully that helps, I don't really know what else I would do.Is it normal? I don't know because everyone else who knew him I either barely know or totally shut off from it themselves and never talk about it. Most I know just act like it didn't happen but I feel stuck.

1ausl60;I’m rambling;QuirkyLength6140;I keep finding conflicting information regarding commonality of notes/letters and it’s starting to stress me out. I feel like my friend definitely would have left at least one to his child but at almost 3 weeks out, I don’t believe anything has been found. I also don’t know how much cleaning/searching has happened at the house either and don’t really want to ask. I guess I’m frustrated (and stressed) because of course this would be the one time he doesn’t say anything and leaves more questions than answers. This has been a -100/10 experience and do not recommend to anyone. I have had two other best friends die but both of theirs were related to accidental ODs. Which doesn’t make them easier to handle, but I do think that somewhere in my brain I had already started to mourn them since they were both active users who had then had long periods of sobriety before relapsing and going with doses they couldn’t handle. Whereas with this death, yes we talked openly about our shared depression and anxiety and made morbid jokes (someone I know said that the “casual suicidality in the way Midwesterners joke” has always freaked her out and it made me stop for a moment), but we also talked about coping skills and supports and therapy and protective factors (like his kid and a handful of friends).

1auqumw;I'm Tired;AdMiserable6582;"I'm so tired of feeling like this. My Dad's suicide has tainted everything. I had a lot of issues with depression, anxiety, and feeling suicidal for a long time until I was in my early 30s. Once I actually started to find peace even in the face of huge amount of stress and trauma I was dealing with, he does that. We're approaching two years and it only seems to get worse and I don't see the point to anything. I go to work and deal with a huge amount of stress, go home and rot on my couch because I literally can barely operate because I'm so drained. I can make dinner and walk the dog and maybe do a bit of tidying up. I feel tainted and broken. It's so evident now that most of the people who I considered friends couldn't give less of a shit if I lived or died honestly. No one tries to connect with me and I'm done trying. My two so called ""best friends"" only care about their relationships and seem to have time for their other friendships. Weekends are so lonely. I don't do anything usually. No one wants to be around me. Doing things alone hurts so bad because I see other people with their friends and loved ones having a great time and I'm just a loser staring at them. I'm divorced and I'm pretty sure no one is going to ever love me in the way I need in my situation. I don't try to weigh my problems on other people. I have always tried to make things light and easy. When I do talk about my feelings, everyone just says to get help for depression. I go to therapy, and I've been on enough medication in my past to know that nothing will work for me even if I wanted to do that.

He had been abusive and controlling which is why i cut ties with him.But suddenly ive been hit with a flood gate of grief and emotions and dont know how to process this. I thought i hated his guts, but i never wanted him dead. and all ive been able to think about is if it was my fault or not, could i have prevented it if i had gotten back in contact with him, would things be different? I just don't know what to do with everything im feeling. Sure he wasn't a good person, but he was still a person, and he died alone thinking nobody cared.I just don't know what to do. Currently im talking to a lawyer about all the legal jargon that comes with this, and trying to get his body transported down so he can be buried in the place he always said he wanted to be buried, since I feel like that's the least i can do.But i just, dont know. Does anyone here have any similar experiences? Everything online wasn't about adult children grief or about the complicated feelings of being an abuse victim of the person who committed suicide so I just..

1au20k1;Reflections on my friend's birthday;snowy_skye;Today is my friend Johnny's birthday. I love them and miss them. They were the most funny and creative and kind soul I knew. But I want to talk a bit about how their death has impacted my life.Johnny died by suicide in June 2023. After their mother called me to tell me the news, I was the one to tell our friends. This task gave me some sense of purpose and accomplishment, and although I could hold and support my friends while they cried, I could not cry myself. Johnny's death happened a few months before I moved cross-country to start grad school. I feel like the combination of these two events has changed my life so profoundly. It was difficult for me to grieve until after I moved when it suddenly hit me, away from family and friends and my partner. My depression came back with a vengeance and my long-distance partner did not or could not understand - he visited me when I was at my lowest and we got into a big argument that destroyed my trust in the relationship. I've never felt so isolated. Thankfully, I started getting the help I needed and I still am. I started making local friends who I am gaining emotional intimacy with. However, I just broke up with my partner earlier this month. I did see that he was trying to understand, but I never felt able to fully gain his love and support and the distance seemed to grow and grow.I think about Johnny nearly every day. I don't suffer from guilt or anger, but I do feel this sadness mixed with an intense need to protect others from hurting themselves and a fear of never seeing someone again. It's hard for me to know realistically that I can't control these things and that there's no amount of vigilance that can prevent bad things from happening. I hope others in this community can understand these feelings, because they are powerful and scary. Thank you for listening and wish you healing and peace with your own grief <3;Today is my friend Johnny's birthday. I love them and miss them.

1atvc1r;My Feelings Are (VERY) Complicated;thee_runningrebel;I found out my ex-boyfriend ended his life this past Monday. I was the last person to talk to him and he likely did it after our last conversation, which was an argument. This has been the longest week of my life. I have a slew of emotions and sensations (as you can probably imagine)—anger, overwhelming sadness, lots of guilt, anxiety, more overwhelming sadness, fatigue, but also one you might not anticipate: relief. My ex was significantly mentally ill, an alcoholic, and my abuser. He abused me emotionally, verbally, psychologically, and even physically towards the end of our relationship. I had to get out for my own safety and survival. The thing is… I feel guilty about the relief part. Towards the end, I was constantly on edge. Worried that he would do it. Worried he would break into my home (again) or harm me or other people I care about. The level of trauma I had been through in just a few weeks was significantly impacting my cognitition. I was dissassociating for weeks at a time. He had threatened suicide a good part of our relationship, so getting that call was my worst nightmare.Yet, when I speak about him in public and to other people who knew and loved him, all I can bring myself to share is how much of a “light” he was and all the good things about him. I’m too afraid to talk about the hell he put me through. I’m ashamed that a glimmer of me is glad he’s dead even though I’m grieving. For the first time in months, I feel free… but I’ve been crying myself to sleep almost every night.How do you mourn your abuser? How do you hold space for your painful experiences with them without “speaking ill of the dead?”;I found out my ex-boyfriend ended his life this past Monday.

1atrxa7;My best friend committed suicide back in June of 2023 and I feel like no time has moved at all.;SpaceCases__;"Hi everyone, my friend, like the title says committed suicide back in June. He left behind his parents, sister, and brother.My mom and I had found him outside of town. Someone on Facebook had seen his truck and his sister sent the location to me since she wasn't close by. I went there with my mom and we had found him. He had been out there for a day, so the blood was dry and his skull looked intact, despite being a gunshot wound.I still remember the early onset of flies, how the skin was cold, almost like something being in the freezer too long, the ligaments stiff, and the swollen and discolored face and eyes. I had a couple nightmares, some pleasant dreams of him after, and then it faded for a bit.Every day I still think about him, in some way or another, but lately it's been taking hold a lot more stronger now. For instance, I started drawing the scene of how we found him. It's not a very good representation, but I feel like I need to get it out. If you've seen Hereditary, it's like the scene where Annie sculptures Charlie's death for a ""neutral view"" of the whole thing. That's how I feel.Of course, I still feel my What-Ifs, my regrets, what I needed to have done. I don't think those will ever go away. They take up so much of my time, that I didn't realize it's already been 8 months. 8 months and I feel like I'm still reliving the days after we found him. 8 months and only a day or two has passed, if that. I'm not entirely sure what to even do anymore. I don't think life is pointless, it doesn't feel pointless, but there's still somehow that pointlessness is all there is.";Hi everyone, my friend, like the title says committed suicide back in June.

1atpfvd;Feeling guilty for feeling happy ;Ivy0420;It’s been six weeks and sadly life goes on. Not in the sense that I feel like I’m moving forward. I might be eating, going to work and showering now but that’s basically it. Working from home really let’s me embrace my isolation and as much as I know better, I don’t care. I went for brunch with my mom and she was like you need to get over this, like it was just that simple. This is the same woman who watched me cry for two months when me and him just simply broke up the first time when I was 21.  like what does she think, another 19 years of loving him happened after that. I’m never going to be the same. Everyone else expects me to be okay so now I just live in a world of make believe where I cry myself to sleep every night, begging for the angels to bring him back to me, giving up only when I see the sun rise at 6 am. Time marches on and I’m sitting completing cegep applications with your daughter, she asks me if we can get the dog out of foster care when she comes to live with me in the fall.

1atiulz;We didn’t just lose her we lost her children too;Kayyaks;"In November 2022, our family suffered a profound loss with the passing of my sister-in-law. Her journey is a testament to both strength and sorrow, as she navigated a tumultuous relationship with her ex-husband.My sister-in-law was a remarkable woman, dedicated to securing a bright future for her family. She worked tirelessly, investing in businesses and properties to ensure her children's financial stability. Despite her efforts, her ex-husband, whom she had supported both emotionally and financially, proved to be manipulative and abusive.After enduring years of mistreatment, my sister-in-law finally made the brave decision to seek a divorce. Despite her ex-husband's deceitful tactics, she was awarded majority custody of their children. However, the legal proceedings were far from equitable, leaving her burdened with a heavy financial strain while her ex-husband retained the business she had purchased for them.As my sister-in-law struggled with depression and loneliness, she found herself isolated and betrayed. Her ex-husband's callous refusal to allow her to see their children on their birthdays only added to her anguish.Tragically, just two weeks later, my sister-in-law took her own life, leaving behind a void that cannot be filled.The situation took a darker turn when the new wife, who had initially expressed disinterest in caring for the children, suddenly adopted them. Despite lacking financial stability and already having a child of her own, she severed all ties with our family and forbade us from seeing the children.Our concerns deepened when we learned from the children's teachers about the neglect and mistreatment they were enduring at home. From failing to do homework to providing inadequate nutrition, it was evident that the children were suffering in their new environment.To make matters worse, the parents showed little concern for the children's well-being, even asking the court to have them pay rent (at age 7 and 5) and expressing intentions to spend their inheritance frivolously.Amidst this turmoil, news of the new wife's pregnancy further divided our family. We were left feeling helpless and heartbroken, mourning not only the loss of my sister-in-law but also the loss of her children, who were being torn away from us by greed and neglect.It's a devastating situation that continues to weigh heavily on our hearts, but we remain hopeful that justice will prevail and the children will eventually find the love and stability they deserve.Every day, we find ourselves gazing at her photographs, longing to catch a glimpse of the children she loved so dearly. We wonder what they look like now, what their voices sound like. Our last encounter with them left us unsettled; they seemed so withdrawn. We were told they are not allowed to speak of their mother. Our hearts ache with the absence of their laughter and presence in our lives. The pain runs deep, and we find ourselves wrestling with a maelstrom of emotions. Amidst the sadness, there's a simmering anger towards those who have caused such turmoil. We can't help but wonder when they will face the consequences of their actions, when justice will be served. Adding to our frustration is the realization that we don’t live in a state with grandparents’ visitation rights, leaving us powerless to reconnect with the children we miss so dearly.In the midst of this turmoil, we cling to the memories of our family and the way things used to be. We miss the warmth of togetherness and the joy of shared moments. Despite the darkness that surrounds us, we hold onto hope that someday, somehow, we will find solace and healing.These circumstances are undoubtedly unique, but I feel compelled to share our story in case someone else out there is grappling with similar challenges. It's crucial that no one feels isolated in their struggles, especially when dealing with the aftermath of a loved one's decision to end their life. The collateral damage can be profound and far-reaching, affecting not only immediate family members but also friends, extended family, and the broader community. My hope is that by sharing our experiences, we can offer support, understanding, and a sense of solidarity to others who may be navigating similar journeys.";In November 2022, our family suffered a profound loss with the passing of my sister-in-law.

1atevli;He was able to leave on his own terms;polkamyeyeout;I have been finding a very weird comfort in knowing that he left this world on his own terms. He was hurting and in so much pain that unfortunately this was his only way he knew how to escape it. He didn’t pass from a car crash and was just driving around blissfully happy about his life and then someone took him etc. He was struggling with life and work stresses, that not even his love for me and his loved ones could keep him around. I’m starting to think that the grief I’m feeling is gut wrenching but is slightly relieved that he was able to leave the world on his terms. He got to tell me he loved me one last time and make sure that he was able to give me all the closure he knew I’d need.The more I think about it, the more remarkable of a man he is. How strong of him. I can’t imagine what he was feeling and he never once made it evident. He never wanted anyone to worry. I wish he would have told me but I truly think there was nothing I or anyone could say or do to stop him. His mind was made up.

1ataegs;It just doesn’t stop;TranslatorOwn6364;Last night I had one of the worst bouts of crying i’ve had in a while. my dad committed suicide 6 years ago and it’s been rough(obviously). I have come to realize that I live my life in sort of a dissociative state. I know my dad is dead and I know that he did that to himself. In my head I feel like i’ve simplified it down to “I just can’t see my dad anymore for whatever reason.” I get these really rare moments where the reality of my situation breaks through and it’s I can’t seem to shove it back down. It is the worst pain i’ve ever felt in my entire life and I can’t make it stop. Normally I can quell these feelings with drugs or alcohol but recently it seems to be making me worse. How am I supposed to cope with this tragedy? I was 14 when my dad died and now i’m 21.    Last night I just couldn’t stop weeping. I cried for 3 hours non stop. I’ve just woken up as I am typing this i’m weeping. I miss my dad so much. I feel like a child calling out for her dad. I miss my father, I want to hold his hand again. I want to kiss him on the cheek before I leave the house and feel his whiskers poking me. I want to sit on the couch and watch a movie with him. I just wish I could call him. For the rest of my life I will never be snake to talk to him again.

I'm 24 and have been dealing with lost questions for what seems like forever now. I never dealt with the news in a healthy way, because my mom didn't tell me until I was 12, and I don't blame her, it's such a hard subject to bring onto your teenager. I knew he died when I was 6, but never knew how, only by ""gunshot"" and you know, when you're young you don't connect the dots like you normally would when you're a teenager going through a pool of emotions. There was nothing left behind, we don't have any answer to the ""why's"", ""if's"" or countless questions we keep ourselves awake at night with. I always feel like there's a piece of myself missing and it never heals, but I've learned to treat it through therapy.   It's so hard to make sense of any of it sometimes, because he should be here. He should be here to see me and my son, his grandson, and my sisters. I go through the sadness, the anger, rage, hate, love, all of it but I feel like I sympathize way too much, like I think and feel he regrets the decision he made, and while I'm sure he does, I hope he knows that if I were to see him today, I'd hug him no questions asked - because I get it.  Suicide fuing sucks. I've gone through it, seen it several times in my life and have had 2 important people close to me pass away due to it, and nothing is ever redeeming about it, nothing. It doesn't help when I go to family reunions and such, and I've had people cry because I look like my dad. I don't know how to react, I didn't even know him that way, I have no memories, just whatever I feel with my gut and that's hard to trust sometimes.

But the contours of grief continue to take shape. It's gotten easier to manage in some ways and harder, trickier, more insidious in others.I often find myself numbing out, avoiding vulnerability, seeking as controlled an environment as possible, one that separates me from the risk of feeling pain like that ever again. It's like a comfortable hole--safe and stable and also a fucking hole. I still can't believe he would do this to the people who loved him. I can't believe I've spent three years of my life fucked up over it. I hate that three of my ""prime dating years"" (I'm 35) have gone down the drain. (I just can't bring myself to take dating seriously, or believe there's someone else for me out there, or risk being hurt like A hurt me.)Sometimes It feels like he took a part of me with him.

1asg6u6;Feeling very responsible ;Ok-Butterfly2984;"Hey everyone. I lost my mom to suicide in July of 2022. I guess I’m wondering if anyone else feels like this. I really feel like I’m responsible for her death. In many ways, but for specifically one reason. The day before she died she tried to jump out of a window. I was home alone with her and when I saw what she was doing and confronted her she denied it. I should’ve called 911 right then and there as she tried to commit a month before that but instead I called my dad and froze. He came home and talked to her. She was in intense treatment for depression and was going to the hospital the next morning for treatment. My dad also tried to get her to go that night but yet 911 was not called. She killed herself the next morning by driving off when we were asleep and took a bunch of pills. If I would’ve called 911 when I saw her doing that she would’ve been alive probably. I’ve been told it wouldn't have mattered anyways as she seemed to have several plans going at once; one of them being the window (found by her search history). Her suicide was easily preventable by both me and my dad. I don’t blame him. We both ended up being blindsided in the end. Now I just feel like a murderer because of how easily I could’ve stopped this. Most of the time I try to ignore this feeling of being so horrible. I feel like I don’t deserve anything because I let her die. I didn’t think she’d do it even though she tried a month before. I know I’m rambling, but I see these posts being like “watch out for the signs of suicide” and it almost makes me laugh because I knew she was depressed and suicidal and yet it still happened because of my inability to react. I try to think of my friends/ and other loved ones knowing what I did, just letting her die and I feel so ashamed.

1ars85u;friends bein weird;LeekLegitimate9600;it’s been 7 months, almost 8 since i lost my dad. The first 6 months i was so extremely depressed. it was soooo hard just to do daily tasks. I ended up getting straight A’s in my first quarter of grad school simply because I had no will to do anything else. I didn’t feel like seeing anyone or talking to anyone or watching anything on TV. Absolutely 100% nothing sounded appealing, so I just did school work because I had to I guess. I think the holidays were just so so difficult and I reached just such an extreme low that once they were over, my brain just shut off to everything that happened. It’s like I went on defense mode and subconsciously decided that if i am gonna survive this, I can’t think about it anymore. It’s like a flip switched. And now I just haven’t really thought about it as much. It just became too hard to think about. I just started kinda starting to feel like myself again maybe this past month. It’s very fresh. I can enjoy things throughout the day again. I can listen to music again. I was happy enough to sing along some days recently. I graduated in June with my bachelor’s, so all of my friends graduated and moved away to new towns. During this time it’s been so hard to stay in touch with everyone and some of those friends have not been understanding. They haven’t reached out to me hardly at all. Before all this, I was always so extroverted and I was so much better about staying in touch. But it’s all different now. Some of them I think haven’t been reaching out to me because they want me to reach out to them, totally not understanding how hard this has been for me or how depressed i’ve been. I feel like people my age just haven’t been through things like this before and are not being very supportive.;it’s been 7 months, almost 8 since i lost my dad.

1arof4x;I miss you, James;Tiberius-2068;"It's February 2015, and I'm at my workplace when I receive a call from my best friend's wife. Answering with my usual lighthearted manner, I expect a typical conversation. However, her somber tone immediately sets a different atmosphere. She urges me to take a seat and mentally prepare myself. Given my role in security at the time, I find refuge in a closet to avoid prying eyes.As she breaks the devastating news, ""James passed away; he took his own life,"" a heavy silence fills the air. Her tears begin to flow, and my usual humor fades away. I'm left in stunned silence, struggling to catch my breath. My knees weaken, and an overwhelming numbness envelops me, as if a powerful blow has struck me directly in the gut.James was more than just my best friend; he was like a brother to me. Our bond was unbreakable, dating back to our days in 1st grade. Fast-forward to age 28, and he was suddenly no longer a part of my life. Even though I hadn't seen him for a couple of weeks, we spoke every day. Not once did he mention anything was wrong. He was there one moment and gone the next. While family is something you're born into, friends are chosen, and James chose me. Now, he's no longer with us.As I approach my 37th birthday on the 22nd of this month, I find myself reflecting on him daily. The loss of James hit me harder than anything else ever has, and the pain is still raw. Even now, I have moments of breaking down. Today marks the anniversary of his departure, and the notion that time heals all wounds is a falsehood. Time doesn't heal; it merely teaches you to coexist with the pain.";It's February 2015, and I'm at my workplace when I receive a call from my best friend's wife.

1arayvd;I’m handling grief in the worst way;miniwhoppers;It’s been a little over a month since he died. We had only been dating for about six months. We were not serious, but I cared about him very much. What started out as a deep sadness has turned into a full-blown depression. I spent the first month obsessively reading through our text messages and news articles looking for answers to my questions. A couple weeks ago I stopped doing this and pretty much everything else. I withdrew from my classes this term. I only work one day a week and I’ve managed to do that. But otherwise I am only doing the bare minimum. I spend all my time playing mindless games and smoking weed. Otherwise I’m crying. I cannot read or play my fiddle or do the most basic things…I keep telling myself that tomorrow I will! But it isn’t happening. He was estranged from his family, so we never met. He only met my parents once. So the only person I know that knew him was his roommate. That has been the loneliest feeling. Since then I have been in minimally in touch with his sister. She sent me the details for his service - March 2nd.Every day seems to last forever, but I get nothing done. My doctor upped my antidepressant. I have a lot of support and minimal responsibilities…so why am I feeling worse? I was thinking that the service would provide some closure for me, but now I am worried about keeping it together emotionally.This sub has been very comforting, as sad as it is.

1aqjox4;My brother committed suicide and I will always blame myself.;PassiveAgressiveSigh;So yeah… heavy title. I want to start off by saying I don’t really post on Reddit much, but I felt like maybe this would help somehow. I tried to post this on r/depression but they removed it and I was told it fit better here so here we go...    Hi all, for context I am a 23yr old woman. I have been diagnosed with depression, numbering and sorting OCD, and BPD.     I am the eldest of 3 siblings. There was me, my middle brother (P), and my youngest brother (G). At the time this all occurred we were 17, 15, and 11.     Me and my brothers grew up mostly in separate households due to our abusive parents. I grew up with my grandmother for the a little over half of my childhood and they stayed with my mom. This is because when I was a baby, before either of them were born, my grandmother went to court and fought for custody of me to get me away from my mom and dad who were drug addicts. Nobody even fought for the boys like that… now to be clear being with my grandmother wasn’t exactly peachy. We were dirt poor and she was an alcoholic with violent tendencies when she got depressed. This caused me to want to move out when I was around 11 and I went to live in another state with my mom, and for the first time in my life, my brothers.     Before this I thought she had cleaned herself up, gotten away from my dad, and was doing better.. that was a lie. I quickly saw she was still a drug addict and alcoholic. She couldn’t hold down a job and we barely survived. There were weeks at a time when all we had were powdered milk and those 99c hot dogs. The things we went through… are unspeakable. Our mother engaged in sex work for money to buy drugs and would shop lift from the local stores. She would throw parties in the apartment full of people who were doing drugs and drinking and having sex. She would allow her boyfriends to beat us. I remember a time when I came home from school and my brothers couldn’t sit down without wincing. I had to force them to show me what was wrong and they’re lower backs and butts were purple with deep bruises. My mother would get drunk and threaten to crash her car. There was a time she thought I ate her valentines candy that a boyfriend had gotten her and she dragged me up the concrete stairs to our apartment by my hair and punched me in the stomach over and over, and bit me until I gave her the phone my grandmother gave me for emergencies. One time she slammed my finger in the door and ripped the pad of my finger off (yes I have a crazy scar). I was sexually assaulted by one of her boyfriends right next to my sleeping mother.     I tell you this to illustrate that things were REALLY bad. And these are just a couple of the things that happened to me in the couple of years that I lived with her.     Eventually she was caught shop lifting at a local grocery store and was arrested. During the arrest they found meth on her so she was also charged with possession. Suddenly our world shifted again. I went back to my grandmother and the boys went to live with my other set of grandparents.    For the next couple of years I was a shell of a person. I couldn’t really eat or sleep… I couldn’t shake the demons that haunted me when I closed my eyes. Me and the boys fell out of touch…. We were kids… i thoughts we had all the time in the world. I dreamed that when we grew up we would reunite… buy houses right next to each other.     Then in 2018, on February 25 we got a call…. P had shot himself and was in the hospital. We drove there immediately. There is not a lot I remember from this next part… I remember getting to his floor and asking the nurse at the station where his room was. I remember turning and taking a few steps towards his room… the moment I got a glimpse of him I collapsed in the floor… he did not make it.     I have blamed myself every day since then. It will have been 6 years in a week and a half… and it’s still all consuming. I will never forgive myself for not getting the boys out of there sooner. For protecting my mother instead of protecting them. I’m the oldest…. It was MY job to protect them… and I failed him. I feel like if only I was more present after our mom was arrested, maybe he would still be alive... A little word of advice from someone who knows... It is so easy to fall out of touch with family. You move away and get caught up with life, especially when you are younger. You may think you have all the time in the world with the people you love but the truth is... you never know how much time is really left.     This time of year is just very hard for me, I guess. I miss him every day. To anyone who has experienced loss like this… how do you cope? How do I cope?     Fly high P ❤️EDIT-Hi everyone. I just wanted to hop on really quick to thank everyone who commented/messaged me in the last day or so. It is incredibly easy to feel like I am so alone in the way I am feeling and the grief I’m experiencing. You have helped remind me that I am not. Thank you. Side note - a couple of people have brought up getting therapy. I went through some pretty intense therapy for years after everything happened with my mom. I stopped going maybe 6 months before my brother died. Perhaps it’s time to go back.Again thank you for the support and love in a moment I desperately needed it.;So yeah… heavy title.

Yesterday at work there was so much chaos, mu brain reverted back to the day she died. I was in fight or flight mode. As soon as I stepped outside of where I work after I clocked out, tears started falling. I sobbed for a solid 30 minutes because all I could think about was that day.

1apufdy;I’m only 5 weeks in;NoriSheet1010;My dad committed suicide on 1/7/2024. My mom and him, were in the midst of their divorce after 30 years of marriage. He was supposed to move into his own place that day. He made a bed for himself in his little pickup truck and left the car running in our family home garage, an empty house that carried so much good and so much trauma. The same garage where my mom was attacked 2 months prior by a burglar, hit with a brick across the face. The same house where all four of us survived a home invasion when I was 12. A childhood friend found him, while he was on the phone with my brother.He was everything to my brother, they were best friends. The image of him hanging onto that casket at the funeral consumes me. I’m so broken - I find myself looking at my hands, my knuckles look just like his. My smile crooked, just like his. My eyes squinted like his when I really “smile”. He was struggling so much - we tried so hard to get him to get help. He was consumed by christianity, trying to find refuge in something that does not correlate with our lifetime. My grandma (80) on my mom side, who inflicted so much trauma and hurt on my mom. Discharged herself from the hospital the day before my dads funeral - decided to drive 6 hours telling no one. She was in an accident and passed away that evening. It was chaos. I dissociated. My mother does not deserve any of this, my heart aches constantly for her. This is our new reality.

1ap9uru;How to help my best friend;tmart42;"I am in a band, and we're all a very close family at this point. We've been touring on the road for almost a decade and we are successful and highly regarded in our genre. Last Friday, we were setting up for a sold out show, and our lead singer got a call from a friend of his who had gone to check on his wife. During the call, I heard him say ""Is she dead?"" a few times...and when he hung up he very energetically confirmed to us that she was gone. She had hung herself at their home dressed in her wedding dress, and had used lace around her neck to protect her skin from getting marks.The ride home was rough as hell as one can imagine, and we supported as best we could throughout. As I said, we are all very close, and I'd consider myself and another band mate to probably be closest to the singer. I sat next to him and held him on the ride home as he sobbed, and I sobbed with him. It's something else to hear someone yell for their wife and stumble over words about how they couldn't protect their baby girl. I am tearing up right now typing this out. It was harrowing.Since then, we've been in triage mode, and today is day three. She was Catholic, so we are meeting with a priest today to plan her services for this Saturday, and a celebration of life for Sunday will happen with all the friends and loved ones. Someone has been sitting with him every night, because he will wake up screaming relatively regularly, and the mornings are horrible of course. He has as big of a support network as one could ask for, and there are a ton of people rising to the occasion amongst our friend group here in town. His family immediately came up, and he hasn't slept in their house of course. Just staying with friends or at an AirBNB. We are moving to get the house they lived in emptied of all of their belongings and move that all to storage, but he has stated that he wants to walk through the home before we do that. I am leading a lot of this effort along side his family, and along with a few other people including the man that found her hanging. I suppose I'm here not only to ask what I should be doing for myself throughout this process as I support him, but also if there is anything specific that helped anyone here out during their process that I and the friends/family have not thought of in order to help our friend and brother as he grieves his wife in such a circumstance. Please feel free to give any critique or suggestion in the comments, as I am looking for anything that will help this man and ourselves.

1aoy9sl;She planned it for so long;Additional-Willow435;My best friend ended her life 3 weeks ago. I've been heavily involved in the process that followed, including organizing a memorial at university we both attended, writing parts of her eulogy, talking to the parents and so much more. I'm absolutely exhausted. But I still wanted to come on her and ask if anyone's had a similar experience of finding out a loved one planned this for very long.She left almost no answers but there are a lot of notes and audios her family has been looking through. She left several letters, including a very long one to me as well as an audio version of it where she reads it to me. It's equally comforting and haunting because she sounds absolutely calm and reflected, talking about all our memories together and how much she loved me and explicitly stating that it's not my fault and that she wouldn't have stayed as long if it hadn't been for me. Again, both weirdly comforting and haunting.Slowly some things are falling into place and while everyone was taken completely by surprise by her suicide, she apparently planned it for almost a year. She never planned the exact date, just always found a reason to live a little longer, a concert or something else to look forward to. With exams coming up and the next big event 10 months away, she said it wasn't worth it anymore so she left. At some point she also made notes on things about her funeral and such, including picking her own pictures.She also wrote the letters months ago and continued to act normal around us. We celebrated her 21st birthday and my life was very hectic that month but she wanted me to come so bad so I did and we all had a great time. She already knew it'd be her last. I don't understand how she could possibly let nothing slip all that time and it's so horrifying to think she was in so much pain for so long and noone had a clue.

1ao711g;One of my closest friends is dead;the_ms_shiva;"Tw: Obviously suicide, but also dv and physical child abuse threatsMy friend had been circling the drain for the last 5 years. It was obvious he had a substance abuse problem that he would lie about (think not telling people what he's taking or how much) which he developed after the birth of his two kids because he resented them. He also was in a ""everyone's toxic but me"" mode which pushed a lot his friends away. He hasn't worked in a few years and his family was struggling because of it. His now ex girlfriend kicked him out of the house because he threatened to strangle their youngest son (who is 4) because his son was ""being manipulative"".When he left, he refused to take his insulin and heart medication. He deleted all of his social media accounts and turned off his phone so we filed him as a missing person. This was two weeks ago and they found him an hour away from his house dead in his car. We know it was suicide. I mourn the man he once was and am horrified at the man he became. I'm sad that there's no chance for him to do better.

1anup8q;I don't know how to do any of this;QuirkyLength6140;"I know I'm repeating the same things as everyone else in here, but I just don't know what to do or how to move on from any of this. I've tried my support system but most of the are equally as traumatized and grieving, so it's been difficult. My very best friend in the entire world killed himself last week - he used a firearm on himself and no one seems to know where it came from. All we know is that that day he purchased the bullets to go in the gun and then wasn't seen until the next morning when he was found by a city crew in a park - a park that was equally between his house and mine. That all of us drove through multiple times while out looking for him for 14+ hours. He was adamantly opposed to guns and if he had his way they'd all be melted down, so it's just shocking that this is the way it all went down. When his wife called me last week to ask if he'd spoken with me or come to my house (we texted daily and he was on foot and I live nearby) and then added he was armed - my immediate thought was with a kitchen knife or something like that. When cops came to make sure he wasn't at my place, I laughed in their faces and said if he did have something gun-like, he'd sooner wave it at them so they shot him than he'd ever do something to himself. Clearly I was wrong and didn't know him nearly as well as I thought I did. I mean, I didn't even know he was planning any of this either and until now, I truly believed he told me everything - even when he'd felt down and had thoughts to end his life in the past (most recently over the summer of 2023). He was seeing a Psychiatrist and had family support. He was actually making moves towards happiness and was excited to see his child graduate from high school in the next few years. I had never seen him so future oriented.But instead he's dead and I'm going through years of texts to see what I may have missed and just really missing my friend like I've never missed anyone before. I keep calling and texting his phone (not recovered) just hoping there's a reply. I know he sent his wife and child a group text and that was the last they heard from him - I don't believe there were notes or anything left, although there were multiple unaccounted for hours on his last day so I'm surprised by this (too). I keep beating myself up that I failed him and I""m also selfishly sad that he didn't even say goodbye. He didn't say anything. The last thing we said to one another was the night before when I did a quick grounding technique with him (he'd had a bad day at work) and he heart reacted it and said he loved it/me. And that he looked forward to hanging out in a few days. He gave no indication that none of that would happen and I'm just crushed. I don't know how to make friends and I'm terrified to let anyone even remotely close to me now. I'm rambling and I'm upset, I know. Tomorrow is his service and I threw up in my car when I drove past the funeral home while attempting to run errands. I don't want to go because I don't trust that I won't pass out or scream or something. I just love him so much. I hate this.I'm also a mental health professional so that's adding to my grief and guilt - although friends have been quick to add that I wasn't his therapist, I was his friend. But when I see texts that say ""you make life easier to live"" or ""When I'm with you, things don't feel so impossible"" it's still hard not to feel that weight on my shoulders. It's also making it hard to find a therapist to see for myself as in one way or another I know them or they knew him, so it's just very frustrating and I am on reddit until I can hopefully find someone not touched by this.I don't really think I'm asking for any advice. I think I just needed to yell into the digital void for a moment. Because I just don't know how to get through any of this. I wake up every day and just want to disappear. Besides my pets, I don't have a partner or kids and I just don't see the point to life when someone who felt like sitting in sunshine to be around and had so much going for him didn't see it either.

1anixrd;My boyfriend chose me to be the last person he saw;polkamyeyeout;My boyfriend died by suicide earlier this week. To say that it has devastated me beyond comprehension is an understatement.While I didn’t know it at the time it was happening, he stopped by my house to see me in his last few moments of life. It was odd for him to stop by on his way to work but he had been a lot more needy and affectionate the weekend prior, so I just thought he was maybe thinking about wanting to move in together or something and take the relationship to the next step.He told me that he came to tell me he missed me whenever he wasn’t with me and I hadn’t been answering my phone in the past hour (it had been on silent so I didn’t hear it) and he wanted to make sure I was safe because he would worry when he would go an hour without hearing from me or answering his calls. He was overall in a good light hearted mood. He kissed and hugged me goodbye as casually as ever, told me he loved me with a smile as he shut my front door. The whole visit lasting 5 minutes or less. And 30 minutes later he was gone. I have been wondering what they call that when someone chooses you to be their last goodbye? Is this common? Is there a meaning to it? Was he looking to me for something? Why did he choose me?I just have so many questions and I just can’t help but hope that I was able to provide him every ounce of love and comfort he was looking for in those last few minutes when he must’ve been so scared.

1ancch1;Skewed Memories;imafruittt;My mom died 9 months ago. Ive had this very odd problem recently while greiving my mom. We had a pretty rough patch the last 2ish years before she died. Im 19 so those years were pretty monumental to me and I feel like thats how I remember her most. I realized Ive been kind of changing her in my head to when she was even the smallest bit healthier and happier than she was most recently. Like when I talk about her, sometimes I stop and realize that she wouldnt have done that or wouldnt have liked that or wouldnt have talked like that. Ill be listening to a new band and swear she would love it and we would have such a blast, but the reality is we probably wouldnt have. As if Im skewing how she really was in the end. Its been very difficult because Ive only known my mom to be mentally unwell yet Im still altering her in my mind to be someone that makes me feel the happiest. Even while typing this I want to write that she was the best, but she wasnt the best. She was an amazing mom but those last few years were very rough for our relationship. I think im maybe blocking out those years just to cope. Just to remember her as good, and not remember her as the pain and anger.

Feb 10th.After going through the experiences of the past 2 years, I have realized it is one of the most triggering days for my PTSD. And I know this may sound like the least relevant problem here, but the fact that I get triggered by my birthday is so inconvenient. And I'm so freaking tired.I've been trying to get friends and family to understand that it would be better for me if we could just not fully acknowledge my birthday. But they react like I have just asked them something completely crazy.For context, birthdays are usually a big deal for people here. Like, a big big deal. And I get that they don't truly understand that when I say PTSD, I mean PTSD. I mean getting triggered badly and being at risk of relapsing. Being at risk of going into heavy dissociation again. Being a risk of very real panic attacks, heavy depressive episodes, etc.But I just wish they would listen. I know they aren't listening. I know they have plans to celebrate regardless of how many times I asked not to.I feel like a jerk. But, to be honest, I'm angry. And I want to ruin whatever it is they planned because I'm angry.I won't do it, I won't ruin anything, because I know they aren't purposefully trying to be awful. But I am so tired and the fact that I am the one who is going to have to deal with the fallout of them not listening is making me sick.Because I am the one who is going to have to go through the pain. I am the one who is going to have to try and keep my grip on reality for the next couple of days. I am the one who is going to have to work my head off so that I don't relapse.And she's dead. I'm alone in this because she's dead. Because we were a team, and now it's been 2.5 years of not having a team and facing everything by myself.... I want to run away and start over someplace where nobody knows me. Where people don't expect me to be someone who died with her.

1an1v9s;Four years. I struggle with so many unanswered questions but am coming to peace with knowing I’ll never get the closure I want.;magaloo202;Today marks four years since my husband died. Or is it actually tomorrow? One of the loose ends that will never get tied up. The 9th was the last time that anyone saw him. We found him on the 10th so legally that is his date of death. I know it was on the 9th though. He went outside of the place he was staying and got his climbing backpack from his car, obviously with intention. That was the last time anyone saw him. I’m riddled with questions I’ll never know the answers to. Was it spur of the moment or did he think about it the night before, waking up committed to the task? Did he sleep at all the night before? None of these questions really make any difference in why any of it happened. I think maybe I feel like if I knew the answers to them I could be there more with him. It makes me so sad to think of how alone he was when he decided it was time to go. His suicide was unexpected, but it wasn’t a surprise. It seemed he was doing so well. We thought he was taking his meds. In his room we found so many full bottles littered around the room. Why did he bother to fill the prescriptions with no intention of taking them? As his mental health deteriorated, our relationship became so toxic. His family was trying to help me get a restraining order to get him out of the house. He finally left. Our divorce was supposed to be complete the following week after his death, but our relationship had been dead for years at this point. I had gotten an anonymous text from someone who clearly knew me with a screenshot of his tinder profile. How humiliating. His mania flew off the charts. He spent thousands of dollars on toys. I’ll never forget my mom coming to visit and how she started to cry when she saw his room filled with toys. I finally convinced him to go see a psychiatrist, found him one, and accompanied him there. He continued to go up until the time he died, but clearly was not being entirely honest with her any longer. I got him connected with a CTE study at Children’s that he never followed up on after the first visit. I know how sick he was, but it made me feel so mad that it felt like he wasn’t even trying. I know how it really works, though. Ultimately, I know that I did everything I could for him, and honestly probably more than I should have. That he did it the week before the divorce felt like such a slap in my face for me… but it was also on my mom’s birthday. I’m sure he didn’t remember that but it makes me so mad he has brought me such sadness on a day that I want to celebrate someone I love dearly.I never really know how I feel towards him. Some times apathy. Usually rage and resentment. For the way he damaged every single person in his family. His little sister, who was only 18, was almost the person who found him, but thank god she wasn’t. She went on to spend months in inpatient psych. The way it destroyed his stoic father— I have never seen him just dissolve before. The way I will never be able to forget one single second of that day. The way I still have such intensely real flashbacks to that day. Remember getting the call from his dad at 7 am asking if I knew where he was. I knew immediately what had happened. Desperately calling friends to see if they knew where he was. His dad calling me back wailing “he’s gone!!! He’s gone!!!!” His dad crying next to the bed we put him on saying “my son! My son!” His dad saying things to me I’ve only repeated to my therapist, like “he could have just stood up”. The thought just makes me want to pass out. There’s so much more I will have to live with for the rest of my life. I have so much hurt from learning that he had been telling everyone lies about me. Often stupid things like “oh I’m late because she was screaming at me and wouldn’t let me leave the house”… when I wasn’t even in the state. Dumbass lies like that to cover his ass but completely maligned me. I can’t believe he had the audacity to do that when I had been trying for so long to help him.When I looked back at pictures of him over the years, I can literally see the light and the life die in his eyes. I was still letting him come see the dogs, and the last time he saw them right before he died he started crying. I thought he was just lonely or sad but now I realize he was probably saying goodbye to them. All of these thoughts just make me want to vomit. I have so much sorrow for him. None of this had to end this way.;Today marks four years since my husband died. Or is it actually tomorrow?

But he didn’t about how he actually felt. I got a load of his clothes and aftershave, I miss his smell. They were all in bags and all I managed to do was put them into suitcases and keep a few tops out. I just miss him, nothing feels the same. I miss hearing him n baby playing then hearing ‘Let’s go see what mummy’s doing’ and then just appearing wherever I was. I start therapy in couple weeks and they asked what I was hoping to get out of it and I just had to say I don’t know. Other than bringing him back I’m not actually sure what will help.

1amw4ja;Anyone else experience intense grief 8 years after;ELWillmurr;Hi all,I'm sorry that you're here for the same reason as I am. My friend took her life 8 years ago. I think I grieved as expected. It was definitely a different type of grief, more complex. This year it is hitting me really hard again- almost as intense as it was when it first happened. Anyone else go through this? Can anyone with a few years ahead of me tell me if this is typical or not? Thing is, she took her life just after turning 40 and I'm turning 40 this year. I'm guessing that maybe there's some subconscious thing going on. I've never done counseling specifically for this grief. I did six months of cbt for a different issue a couple of years ago. I'm sure I brought it up, but never specifically did grief counseling. If I was to do some grief counseling now, I wouldn't even know what to say. What would I expect in a session? Is there anything helpful in grief counseling? What words can I even say all this time later? It's just pain and sadness that won't pass.;Hi all,I'm sorry that you're here for the same reason as I am.

1amp6ds;My wife suffered so much;Expensive-Tadpole451;She was raped and beaten nearly dead when very pregnant with our boy. He didn't come home from the hospital. She has her face messed up, lost some use of her fingers. Needed a cane for awhile. She never talked about what he did, never. Left me around a year after. I finally got her to do therapy for it, hoping maybe she talks about it finally. No. She killed herself instead. But she left me with a note, said it explains everything. It took me almost two months to read it. Finally I started.My God. It's worst thing I've ever heard. In some ways it helps lots. His DNA wasn't in system and my wife was very rude and uncooperative. They never got him. I have his name now. There were no signs of breaking in and my wife didn't answer the door alone unless she knew someone was to come. My sweet innocent wife was making a salad, went to her garden to pick fresh ingredients. Making a healthy meal for our boy. She didn't lock the door. He snuck in and came up behind her when she was making her lunch. Now I know why she quit gardening, quit cooking. I've been picturing how it could happen for years. I feel calmer knowing. But that means he was watching her! For how long! Few weeks before it happened, our house had two doors. We never used the front only said. Guests came to side door to. Few weeks before my wife said she thought she heard someone opening the front door. Says the dog barking scared them off. I thought it was mistake, didn't take her seriously. I left the dog at my brother's when I went out of town, didn't want my pregnant wife dealing with him alone. If I'd left the dog maybe he scares him off again But other ways it's not so good. I haven't finished it. Made it through she's talking about first time he did it to her. He hasn't started beating her, she hasn't gone into labor. The happiest part of this is my wife describing her rape. It's fucked. I wasn't expecting how much detail she goes into. I should of because that's my wife, how she was. But reading the things he says to her. She describes what he felt like inside of her. How scared she was. It's sad she says if it'd stopped there she wasn't going to tell me at all. Didn't think I needed to know. Why couldn't she of talked to me about it? She says she didn't think she was allowed to be upset about the things he did to her because of what happened to the baby. That was lots worse. She says she was very upset because it was important to her to not be with anyone but me for rest of her life. Did she think I thought she betrayed me! I never think of like that. Some of these things he said to her, she tried to bring up in bed. It makes me a little sick. Her friend told me to reconnect with her, she needed help. Said she was dating abusive psycho and thought it was because she needs to recreate the abuse to control it. Reading this, knowing that, she was right. I wonder how far she took acting it out. It helps reading because I'm glad she doesn't have to live with these memories any more. Wherever she is, it's somewhere this didn't happen. I hope she's at peace and with our boy.  Getting to be his mother. I give her credit for not doing this sooner. Getting out of bed every day must if been so hard. After it happened she couldn't be alone. Had panic attacks if she was home alone. IDK if she ever got passed that. No more panic attacks for you now my love. You're safe.

How can anyone say that they could have stopped another person's choice to die if that person never told anyone?I'm beginning to feel bitterness set in.

1ammj6r;why did he leave me;throwaway917160;i feel so empty. it’s been barely over 24 hours since i called the police after he sent me his suicide letter. i was the last text he sent before he shut off his phone and did it. he bought a fucking rifle last week and nobody knew. i only knew him for a short amount of time, but the amount of love i have for this boy is more than anyone will ever know. i fell in love with him, nobody i’ve ever met is like him. it’s selfish to think like this right now but i’m worried i’ll never find anyone like him ever again, i’m convinced this boy was my soulmate.we lived in different states. i met him online, i literally slid in his dms because i thought he was cute. never would i ever have thought i’d make a connection like i did with him. he talked to me about his mental health struggles, but i thought he was getting better. there were times where he’d disappear for a few days and not reply and he’d come back so apologetic saying he was just depressed. i supported him, we worked through it. 2 weeks ago he completely ghosted me and i don’t know why i was so fucking stupid to think it was just because he didn’t want me anymore. he reached out a week ago, sent me song lyrics saying something about how he was afraid to die. at this point he had already bought the fucking gun. i didn’t know. i replied, no answer until i guess now 2 days ago. he said he had something to send me and i was so irritated i thought i got ghosted that i was being short with him. i’m so fucking stupid. he asked me how i was doing, all i replied is if he’s sending it to me or not. if i had known it was his suicide note i NEVER would’ve said that. i could’ve stopped this. we didn’t have a good last conversation, i would do anything to turn back time and be with him again. when he sent the letter he had driven over an hour away from home. he was at his suicide spot. he picked it. he planned it. i can’t believe this is real life right now.his whole letter was him telling me how much he loves me. how special i am to him. how he’s sorry he did this but we’ll be together in another universe. i am completely fucking shattered i feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. i want to think that he’s at peace and in a better place but i’m struggling so bad at believing in an afterlife right now. i want there to be us in another universe. he said “until we meet again”. WHY THE FUCK DID HE LEAVE??? i could’ve helped him i don’t know i’m so sad i feel like such an idiot. why didn’t he tell me? he loves me so much, why did he leave? i have talked to all of his family members now for the first time and i’m flying out to meet them. i never met this boy in person but the way he made me feel is unlike no other. i’m convinced he was my soulmate and i’ll never find anyone ever again. i’ll never be the same. i’m only 20 i can’t imagine carrying this weight for the rest of my life, mourning him, mourning what once was, mourning was could’ve been, i miss him so much i wish i could bring him back all i can ask is why did he leave why why why i keep screaming and crying nobody understands. i’ve read his letter a million times over, i can’t believe i was the last text he sent, i think it was because he knew i’d be able to talk him out of it. he sent me the longest message too. how the fuck am i supposed to move on i know grief is just love in a heavy coat but i never want to love again all i want is him there’s nobody like him he made my life complete i’m so shattered fully ripped to shreds inside;i feel so empty. it’s been barely over 24 hours since i called the police after he sent me his suici;;1;6;2024-02-09 11:58:49;2024-02-09;Friday;11:58:49;3501;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:16.631816
1amlgi0;It feels like I’m not really alive;Illustrious_Ad1887;In a couple days, it’ll be a year since my little brother committed suicide. He was only 20 and started having psychotic episodes from smoking weed heavily which led to getting Schizophrenia. It was bad but it got so much worse in such a short amount of time. At first he was praying at night to God for hours when he wasn’t religious at all, then he thought people were whispering about him on the street, then God or another being was speaking to him and telling him to do things, then the cops were called after he almost stabbed my mom saying God is telling him to chop her limbs off. It all happened so quick. From weed of all things. And I know, I know he could have gotten Schizophrenia anyways later on in life but there’s also a chance it wouldn’t have. But we’ll never know now. I let him smoke what I had sometimes. I had a medical marijuana license for a chronic pain condition and he was fine at the time. He had other ways to get weed but our culture and what I did and let him do normalized it for him. I blamed him for his actions because I didn’t know he had Schizophrenia, and whenever I’d tell him to stop smoking he’d laugh it off saying it’s just a plant. The cops would take him to the psych ward and he’d be let out in 2 days. My dad let him stay at his house for a couple months but he was terrified. At some point me, my dad, and my mom all had to cut contact after his last hospital stay and a couple days later, he hung himself in the woods. He was probably living on the streets for several days before finding himself in a youth shelter. They said he never spoke and one morning just left. I told my parents not to contact him and I ignored all of his calls. I can imagine him hanging from the tree so vividly it’s like I was there watching it happen. I didn’t know I could get PTSD from something I didn’t even see happen but my therapist said it’s possible. All I have is guilt. Guilt from every stupid fight we ever had, guilt from that one time I went to disneyland for a school trip and when my mom and him came to pick me up I didn’t let him go because he’d take all the attention from my mom away for himself, guilt for not calling him one last time. The last time I ever saw him was when he was having a meltdown in front of the cops as he was arrested. And I have so much rage at the cops and the hospital. They did nothing for us. The last psychiatrist told my parents if they signed a form, my brother would be inpatient for up to 75 days. That was our holy grail, our last hope. But the next day, he said my brother will be released because he wasn’t showing any signs of hurting himself or others even though he had just told my mom he was going to end his own life and he was there after he almost killed my mom. We both begged the doctor to keep him in the hospital showing all the evidence we had that proved he would 100% kill himself or someone else. He ignored our calls after that and released him. A couple of days later, he was dead. I spoke to multiple lawyers who all said they wouldn’t take the case. It’s a system problem they said.The only reason I haven’t killed myself is because then my parents would have no children left. It feels like everyone I see is going through life while I’m stuck in this deep dark hole of suffering. I don’t know how to live. If I’m happy, I feel guilty. If I’m sad, I feel guilty. All I do everyday is do anything to distract myself from feeling this guilt and pain.;In a couple days, it’ll be a year since my little brother committed suicide.

1amhakk;I haven’t let myself grieve.;Anxious-Pea988;Right after Thanksgiving this past year, my(23F) dad(45M) got a call from my half-sisters’ (13 & 15) grandma. She had found my previous stepmother hanging in her garage. I didn’t have much of a mom growing up, she checked out when I was two. So when my dad met (Stephanie) a couple years later, that was mom. After two children between her and my dad, an engagement, our first house, it all fell apart. She had a heavy drinking problem, started treating me poorly and my dad told her to leave. He confessed since this happened that the reason he never moved on fully was because he was waiting for her to get sober and come home. I never understood until this point why he continued to entertain her and not my mother. Having to be with my dad when we told them their mother wasn’t alive anymore, I’ll never get their screams out of my head. The way they begged me to be lying, that they will never see them have kids or be married, how they just need to see her one last time. And then having to break it to them that she hung herself, and they cant see her. It was all over again. We always made jokes growing up about who had the crappier mother. Their mom was very obviously an alcoholic but never confessed to whatever else she was obviously using. It was always easier for me to one-up them because my mom moved two thousand miles away and never looked back, their mom lived a couple of blocks up the street and still was present in their lives. Now, I don’t even know how to comfort them because I was always able to relate. This time I can’t, I wish it was me instead.

1ameuw0;4 weeks ago he learned he was dying;HistoricalButterfly6;I had been estranged from my biological father for 20 years, he still talked to my brother occasionally. On January 9th his doctor told him his stage 4 cancer had metastasized and he was dying. My brother told me, and I called our father immediately. He said all the things you’d want an estranged parent to say: it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t deserve the way he’d treated me, I was perfect and the best thing that ever happened to him, he was so ashamed of himself and so sorry. I weeped talking to him, and told him I’d forgiven him years ago but owed him an apology too- I had needed to stop talking to him for my own mental health but knew it broke his heart. He accepted my apology, told me I had nothing to apologize for, and we started to get to know each other again. He said it was the best day of his life. Three phone calls were great- he was 5 years sober. A different man. Promised he would never leave me again. But the cancer in his spine was keeping him awake at night and the doctor prescribed meds for sleep and for the pain. He didn’t want to take them- he was so proud of his sobriety. But he was dying and in so much pain. And he started sounding like an addict again. I had to pull back a little and told him I could talk once a week. He was upset and wanted to talk more, until I reminded him of all the things going on in my life. I said I could for sure commit to Saturdays, and we could try other days. Saturday he called to say he couldn’t talk. Sunday he called twice while I was busy, and he begged me to call him. But he sounded like an addict and the calls were starting to kill me- he regretted his whole life and had no time to change anything. It was horrifying to listen to, I would get off the phone and sob on my floor, imagining his pain and fear. It was too much to do every day for this man who never parented me. I was going to call him Saturday. Wednesday January 31st they found him. He shot himself and didn’t leave a note, or a will. We’ll never know what day he died- between the 29th and 31st. He had packed up the entire house. My brother and I, by law, will get it. It’s worth almost a million dollars. His bedroom and refrigerator were covered in our photos. I had to fly out bc both my brother and I live out of town. A stream of people I’d never met came to the services we’d set up. Told my brother and me how much he had loved us and that he spoke of us often. I genuinely don’t know what he would have said. I really did love him, and also he brought so much pain into my life even before this. Now I feel nothing, but I can’t think straight. I don’t recognize my brain.

1amema3;Two years in april.;imlearningagain;We lost my son’s father April 10, 2022. i had made him move out about 8months prior due to emotional and mental abuse i couldn’t handle anymore. i had started videoing it i guess because i was afraid. i even resorted to not saying anything because when i did it just made it worse. he was so angry with me leading up to it. i had just message after message that some didnt make sense but i was trying no contact to hopefully let him calm down. i made him go to his brothers. on the 9th they asked him to go to the store and he hadn’t come home, they called me asking if he was there and he wasn’t i thought the sound i heard was my door settling but now i question if i heard it when they called. i had spent many night waiting on him to get home worried bc he was drinking and driving. i was on my way to my moms, and their uncle called me and said they had found him, his brother and nephew had found him behind the shed in the yard. he had wrecked his brothers car and walked home gotten his grandfathers hunting rifle and took his life. i wanted him to get better so badly. that’s all i had ever wanted. i tried so hard but he was hurting me so badly and in front of our son. not physically but i think if i had let him come back again like i desperately wanted to i don’t know if me and my son would be here right now. and his brother thought the same thing. i feel so much guilt. it still hurts so much. my son remembers the yelling, he’s asked me about it. he’s said “did daddy yell at you because he didn’t love you?” my heart breaks.;We lost my son’s father April 10, 2022. i had made him move out about 8months prior due to emotional;;1;5;2024-02-09 03:31:38;2024-02-09;Friday;03:31:38;1542;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:16.639797

1amb26p;Lost a friend today;Wolf_Gang_13;My friend's body was found at a hotel. Unsure which one but her mom texted me it. I tried to work today so when I read the text, at work, I had a breakdown and asked to be dismissed. After work, I went to Walmart to get a box to put her cloths in it. I kept a few things and a jacket, some how it fit me. I guess I've lost so much weight and I didn't notice.I took my mom with me for moral support but it kind of made things worse. I used a gift card that my friend left me, and my mom is just adding pointless things to the cart. I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her even though I tried to tell her not to get pointless stuff.feels weird as is using the gift cards she left me. Feels so gross using them but I understand that if they don't get used, they'll expire. Also, she did verbally give me permission to use the gift cards when she was alive. Makes me sick to my stomach. All I needed to buy was a box, packing tape and something to eat for myself. Food could be looked at as pointless, but she knew that when I was depressed, I couldn't eat, I had to force myself to eat food. Sometimes she even cooked and brought food to me when she knew i couldn'teat but i still tried. I miss her so much, i loved her so much.

1amasd6;My dad killed himself and all that he left are questions….;TapDisastrous7662;This is my first time ever using Reddit.. yup I came to the point where I have no answers to my questions so I came here. My 52 year old step father (who’s been in my life since I was 8 so I basically call him my dad) committed Suicide on 1/12/2024. He shot himself in the head in the back yard of his house. He left no note, no will, nothing. Nothing but questions that I seem to never have the answers for in this life time.Back story: My mother and step dad were together for 15 years. It wasn’t the best marriage in the world. They would fight. My mom cheated like 11 years in. He “forgave” her. They ended up divorcing end of 2022. He loved my mom, he loved our family with my younger brother that they had in 2007. He loved us as a UNIT. It was obvious that he never got over my mother. He loved her no matter what and strongly believed that divorce was never an option. Years go by obviously he’s still working and living day by day. My brother continued to live with him, my mom moved to P.A.I would say 4 or 5 months before his death, he started becoming obsessed with his face. (In prior years he would have ingrown hairs on his beard area and pluck and mess with them until he basically developed like a facial infection) So my step dad claims that he has made and basically discovered a serum or cream or product (never knew exactly what it was bc he would say that if anyone knew that they would come to kill him) & the discovery that he made has been clearing his face at a fast rate and that it was incredible. He would state that that there was going to be a facial outbreak and people were going to get this infection and only he had the cure. He would take pictures of people on CNN to send to me and say l”ook at their face they have it!” Again, he claimed that if “they” or government knew of this discovery, they would have to come and kill him. On 1/10/2024 my brother (he’s 16) calls me and says “dad is acting weird.” “He’s scaring me, I even brought a small knife to my room and called 911” 911 had came but claimed they couldn’t do anything. He says that dad was also sending him weird pictures of Egyptian mythology stuff. 3rd eye stuff. That he was telling him to get him the car with him late night and my brother didn’t want to. Just erratic and not normal behavior. He begs me to pick him up, (I live 45 min away) I go there to get him and he runs out the house with 4 layers of clothes on him and 2 bags of his stuff. (My step father and brother were best friends! They did everything together. He was my step dad’s life! My brother is a good kid. He doesn’t really go out. He does what he’s told. So it was strange for him to call me and say all that he did and to even run out of the house like that) My brother stays at my house over night. Before that, when we were on the way home. I thought we wouldn’t even get 20 min down the road before my step dad would call and ask where he went! It isn’t a big house. It was relatively easy to know if he had left. No call ever from him. The last thing we heard from him was a text message that he sent my mom at 4am. Reading “baby, I miss you. I now know you were so much close to god than I was. No more talking, come home now” My 48 year old uncle (his ex brother in law, my moms brother) who is disabled also lived in the house with my step father and brother. His disability is more where he thinks he’s younger than he is you could say? He doesn’t drive. He rides a bike. He can’t really cook for himself and do things like that. Anyway, we find out that my step dad has choked him with a long painting pole that has like a paint roller at the end. He’s punched him in the face, kneed him in the chest and pointed a gun at him.Now this was an absolute SHOCK. I mean my disabled uncle wouldn’t hurt a fly so my step dad most have just run up on him and attacked him. For what reason? Idk. Later that night is when my step dad went outside and shot himself in the head in the back yard. Why? Was it because he loved my mom so much and he couldn’t bare not having his family? Did he feel like he couldn’t come back from what he did to my uncle? Was he going crazy? Why Egyptian mythology ? Why was he trying to take my brother somewhere late at night? Why text my mom that? These are questions I will never know. I just had to share some of the story because there’s definitely more that contributes to it but my only question is why wasn’t my younger brother enough for him?? Why would he do such a selfish act. He was a good man! He was a college graduate. He was smart. He had a drone company I mean this was a guy that would just talk to a random person in a line and make their day better. He wasn’t a sad, negative person. To end this, you’ll never know what someone else is going through. Never. You’ll never know the demons they may be fighting. It’s the people you’ll never guess that do stuff like this. I’ll ever get how he was able to bring that gun to his head and pull it. That is the last person in the world who I thought would be capable. RIP to the man that raised me. I’m sorry I couldn’t help you.;This is my first time ever using Reddit.. yup I came to the point where I have no answers to my ques;;20;91;2024-02-09 00:24:12;2024-02-09;Friday;00:24:12;5098;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:16.643539
1ama82i;Grieving my dad;Beautiful_Map_6474;My dad took his own life when I was 12, 7 years ago. I had always thought that by now the grief would have subsided, and although it has in a way, it’s still constantly there. It’s always there, constantly reminding me of the life I/we could have had together, making me question every little memory I have with him wondering wether I could’ve done anything, wondering if he loved me, if it was my fault etc. I don’t actually believe it was my fault and I deep down know I couldn’t have done anything for him at 12 years old but that doesn’t stop me thinking about the fact I knew he was acting weird that day and I didn’t even ask him “Are you okay?”, I didn’t even bother telling my Mum that he was being weird. I still picture the sight I saw when I walked in his at-home office and saw him there after school. That day I had passed my maths test and I knew he was ‘working from home’, so I rushed home to tell him just to find him there all by myself without a clue what to do. The memories are in my dreams at least once a week and I can’t stand it. I’ve been going to bereavement therapy since he passed, but it hasn’t helped but I hope one day it will. In my opinion, suicide is the most shocking, confusing and  saddest cause of death, to grieve and I don’t truly think i’ll ever recover from the trauma it caused me.That isn’t to say that it hasn’t gotten easier, it most definitely has but it’s still just as hard some days.

1albth5;Grieving Someone I wasn't really close to;TryingOutNewThings12;"I'm not sure how to feel honestly. A couple of months ago a friend of mine killed herself and we weren't really close. The thing was when I saw her, she always seemed so sad it feels like I should have done something. My memories include us sitting together in our english lessons when I would play with her hair or seeing her at the airport once by coincidence and I waited with her and her sister for them to get their bags off. I remember how much she used to like to hug.I left the country I had lived in with her and her sister slept over at our house. The girl came with her mother to pick up her sister. I remember the too-light shade of concealer she was wearing, the red shoes and blue jeans she was wearing all too well. She had asked me what subjects I picked for my studies to see if we would be in the same classes.I reminded her I left the school and it had left her mind, she just went 'OH RIGHT!' Seeing her in my house away from where we used to go to school was so strange; as though she wasn't meant to be there. I was in an old pair of pyjamas and honestly I didn't know I was going to see anyone.I like to think it was planned for me to see her before she had committed for some kind of closure. I just hate myself for thinking everything bad I did about her. We only had fleeting interactions and smiled at each other in the corridors. When we would have lessons together she would just sleep through them, I would think that she must be tired. I know it's not my fault but I wish I had pushed for her to talk.The hardest part was when I found out. I had no one here who would understand. My friends were all back home and I remember telling my mum and her telling me that we weren't that close so I shouldn't be this affected (I know she didn't mean it in a bad way) but it really hurt. The harshest aspect is I understand her perspective but why is it I cannot get over this?I dreamt about her the other day, I was in my old school and she was going up the stairs as I was going down. I saw her hair and she was surrounded by her friends at school. I had thought (in my dream) so she's not dead? And I just continued on with my life.I woke up and wished I had spoken to her in my dream. I miss her but I think after she had come to my house that one time I probably wouldn't have seen her again/ spoken to her again.I wish she is resting peacefully now. I think back to all the times we would talk about aspirations for further education and all that's in my mind is she is forever 16.I do not know how to move on, I honestly don't think I ever will. I've known many people who have attempted, including those close to me and just seeing her do it it so painful.Forever 16, I miss you.";I'm not sure how to feel honestly.

We haven’t been in touch since 2019. One day in January 2023, he came across my mind so I decided to look him up on Facebook that’s how I found out about his passing. This grief journey has been complicated. We met on IG fall 2014. We bonded through old school music. There were feelings. I wanted more and he wanted to remain friends which caused strain in our friendship. We were kindred spirits. He was a private person. Before his passing, he was sick which I had no clue. I thought he was avoiding me and abandoning me. One of the last times we contacted each other, he told me that he was going through a rough patch and it was over he promised to reach out to me which never happened. We never got a chance to go to a concert together. I’ve just been feeling alone and this has been difficult to navigate. The pain is fresh.;Hi, my friend’s birthday is February 16.

Yeah, my friend died by suicide on leap day.I’m fine! No, I totally don’t have a completely deranged hatred, fear, and complete inability to deal with anything leap day related. I SO haven’t demanded every leap day since off everything, or just blew it off. No, no, I didn’t start shaking and almost throw up when it came up at work. I wasn’t really glad to work from home because I let some tears slip.Except I did, I did all that, and a lot of other completely irrational things. I’m not an irrational person! I realize that I just passed my anger onto the day, and my grief, and maybe some OCD. I get really worried that someone might die as it approaches. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t focus. It’s been 16 years! My grief is nearly an adult. Even knowing that I made some strange association with the day, I can’t shake it. I’ve been trying to hold it together since maybe mid December, but I feel like I’m holding on with a pinky finger and someone’s just dropped oil on it.I also know that I’ll push through. I’ll start to emerge from the winter doldrums like he didn’t. I’ll remember how I compartmentalized and I’ll pack it away. I’ll tell myself that I’ll get to it, eventually. I do have 4 years.Then I’ll glance over at it, this trauma sitting in a box on a table in my mind, and it’s huge! How in gods name did it get so big?! So I go in another room and I shut the door. It’s my mind, I don’t have to go in there if I don’t want to. I might peak in the room but I won’t face it. Then it’s been 4 years, and it’s back for the regularly scheduled breakdown. I’m almost certain it’s just stuck in there now, and I’ll cart it around until I die. No, I am certain, but I would like to coexist with it peacefully.

She is the only daddy's girl and looks just like him... I met him on his 17th birthday and we got together a year and half later on my 19th birthday.  He died just a little over 2 weeks before what would have been his 27th and his funeral was a few days after.  The night before he died he said ""I thought we were going to grow old together.""  I was looking at birthday gift ideas for him and 4 days later I had to pick his resting place... Now I have to raise two kids and grow old without him. I don't care much for holidays but I always try to make birthdays special. I've been missing him a lot more these last few days and it just really hurts getting all these preparations done without him. He had near death experiences before. First time from an accidental overdose when he was a teen. Second time about 2 years ago when he unknowingly took a fentanyl laced pill and the third time about 1 year ago in a car accident.  I used to tell him that God had multiple guardian angels working in shifts to save him from trouble. I tried to call and get help to him before he shot himself but it seems like everything that could go wrong that day did and God finally took him.  Sometimes I wonder if he died one of the other ways that losing him would hurt a little less.

1ajwihs;I found my husband (39M) hanging 12 days ago;Carofine88;I had a feeling something wasn't right. I opened the garage door and for a moment thought he was standing there. When I realized he wasn't I slammed the door and started screaming. Our 8 & 5 year old boys were standing behind me. I'm not sure what they saw but they saw my reaction. I grabbed them and we ran out the front door to the neighbours. My screams brought people out from everywhere. My neighbour grabbed the kids and took them inside her place. Someone rang the police. I ran back in to make sure it wasn't too late. But the smell, that distinct smell. His skin was icy cold and his tongue black. He was taller than the noose was high so at any point he could have stood up. He used the anchor point for the boxing bag gift he brought for our sons to tie the strap through. He flattened a box and put it underneath him. He took off his apple watch I had just brought him because he knew it called 000 if it detected no heartbeat.So deliberate. No note, no nothing.I am so numb. In so much disbelief. Surviving every minute. My children thought I saw a burglar and my screaming was a reacting to that.

1ajtbjr;Auto Claim;Lynch52358;On January 21st, my Step-son committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a 9mm handgun. He did this in his brand new 2023 Dodge Ram Lariat. He had Geico insurance. Paid up, no problems there. Geico is denying the claim because it doesn’t meet the definition of Comprehensive due to there being a fatality. It also doesn’t meet the criteria for Collision since there was no exterior damage to the truck. So they are saying he didn’t have coverage that would take care of the interior. I just can’t imagine they haven’t had to deal with this before. They act very confused on how to process the claim. Has anyone else had to fight this battle? The truck was leased through Stellantis and they told me Geico would probably deem the truck a total loss and then they would work with Geico and make arrangements with them for the truck.

1ajc731;My first step towards gaining peace;sladenoire;"As we all know, the loss of someone by suicide is never a loss you fully heal from due to the complexities of their death. August will be two years since my ex passed and this year, I will seriously begin healing from his absence. My first step is to slowly remove my attachment from items I have from him, even if it means I have to get rid of it. Today, I traded in my phone for a new one...I've had an unhealthy, near-sabotaging attachment to any item I owned I received from him but most specifically, my phone. The current phone I've had for over two years, I got to match his and he bought it during a good period. After his death, my phone felt like a bridge to him. I had called him on it, taken photos and videos of us with it. Recently, my phone's issues have been increasing and I finally accepted it may be time to let it go. This time, I had little tears and guilt about it. I called my friend to talk it out a bit as it's still an emotional act for me, but I know it's for the best. I am not a bad person for wanting to move forward and work towards lessening the pain's effect on me. I know it's just a phone but for the past year and a half, it's been a bridge to him and the ""us"" I like to remember. I'm really proud of myself for beginning to separate material items from my emotions. It just gives me a small amount of peace towards him and his decision to leave like he did.

1aj2cbp;We got the note back;Massive-Anteater8964;We found out a few weeks after my brother passed away in sept 2023 that he had left a note. It was being used as evidence in his inquest so we didn’t hear anything about it for a while. During that time, I did so much research into other loved ones and their experiences with suicide notes and found out that it is quite rare one is left and majority of the time the contents tend to be extremely vague and or incoherent. My dad got my brothers back a few days ago and showed it to us today and I’m just shocked. It is extremely coherent and well thought out. He detailed his wishes for his things, his funeral and gave an insight into what was going on in his headspace. He also said that he had attempted before in early 2019 and we had ZERO idea. I just don’t know how to feel. He was studying to be a mental health nurse and both of our parents work in the mental health field. I guess maybe he felt like with all the knowledge he had he still would’ve been better off not being here? He stressed that there was absolutely nothing anyone could have done but I just can’t believe that we had all missed this over the last 4 years of his life.

I came home late and found you up in your chair, working on your laptop, past your usual bedtime. We talked a little, you said something like ""Goodnight, I love you."" I don't remember what I said back, but I hope it was something like ""I love you too."" I hope you knew that regardless, but maybe you forgot, or it was pushed to the back of your head. I don't know.I only am realizing a little bit ago that this bug was in your head for a long time before you finally gave in. You worked late, you were tired all the time, the smallest things were so irritating to you. When Mom tried to separate, you just acted on it. To your credit--I guess--you were thoughtful in every step of it. Took a short walk into the woods, called 911, had an ID on your person so that we would not have to identify you. It's like you just vanished that night, and I never saw you again. You left us a note. I have it saved, though I can't bear to look at it. I could tell just how little you thought of yourself. It's painful, to know you felt that way. None of us had any idea.I'm realizing that you hadn't been happy for years. You'd just been going through the motions, together with your family, and when the situation changed and that family seemed on the verge of splitting you just saw no way to go on. And I don't know what to say about that. I don't know if any of us were equipped to help each other. I don't know if I should say sorry, if I should be angry, whatever. I don't even know if, had you made it through that week, you'd even be happy now. You would probably be so miserable.Still wish you were here, though. I have lots and lots to tell you.I like to think you're still around? Or listening, or feeling, or something. It's just impossible to me that you could just be totally gone. Hell, I expect to see you half the time when I come home still. I hear you in my own voice. So you're still here-ish. I bet, being on the other side, you'd regret what you've done. But if you are still there, and watching me, I just have to take this as the next best thing. I know if you thought you'd had a choice, you'd have stayed. So stay with me until we meet again someday.

I only talk to him when its about the child. He said he badly wants to visit and I told him… a few weeks is too soon to prove you’ve changed your.Without communication often, he hanged himself just this Monday. Leaving us letters.It hurts, I’m mad, I’m devastated to see people make up stories when I’ve always informed his family and friends of his own struggle. I have always been transparent and at his death, they dare say that they do not know what happened…I hate his friends who caused us to be more divided in the final days… I wish we both have better support systems but I only knew this method to resist him 😔I miss him now.

1aiebrz;I’m not doing okay;An0n444;My mum and I spoke for almost 2 hours and she was shocked that her youngest gave her such advice. We have a complicated relationship. It’s been tough having her as a mum but I do love her. Trauma disturbs shit. I’m just unsure whether to let her in but I know that I want the best for her. In or out of my life. I told her this was always me but I guess she’s just started to properly listen to me. My brother knew me though. Losing him has destroyed my entire world and balance. He truly was my entire world. He was my brother, best friend and dad all in one. I always told him that rather than my dad, that I don’t really have a relationship with, I’d want him to walk me down the aisle and now that can never happen. Life is apathetic though and makes you build anew. I’m not new to losing and having to rebuilt. Now I have to restart. Life doesn’t make sense without him. He was my best friend and still is. I’m an annoying younger sibling and everything I like and enjoy is cause he shared it with me. Everything. I wish I could tell people how fucking scared I am. It was in September and I’m already thrown into the deep end. I fake it so well and I just don’t know what to do. I still sleep like shit, the only difference is that I sleep less and wake up early. I hate feeling like a burden to others but I’m so fucking sad. I’m heartbroken. I wish people checked in or phoned me. Tried to make an effort. I feel like I’m on autopilot but crashing all at the same time. I have to work, finish uni, be a friend, girlfriend, etc and there’s never no time for me. I don’t even allow myself to have that time and I don’t know how to change that. I’m just scared and pissed off. Never at him but everything that isn’t him. I’m really sad and I’m so lonely. I’m “strong” but it’s so lonely. I just wish people checked in and gave me a hug they weren’t looking forward to end. Like comforting me isn’t the top priority but the fact I’m here and sharing my feels was enough. I feel like an inconvenience a lot of the time.My brother made you feel present. He made you feel safe. He’s the person that lets you cry, hears everything, hugs you and brings you tea simply because. I miss how comfortable I was with expressing my feelings to him. He’s the only person I felt safe with to cry. Now I feel like I’m holding people prisoners and they’re just waiting for it to stop.

It made me think about what I was going through helping my husband battle bipolar disorder for many years and the toll it has taken. One night when my husband and I were talking, I brought up that I didn’t think he would’ve been here for me like I’ve been for him all these years. I mean, he constantly abused me, cheated on me repeatedly, and turned into a very terrible person when he was manic…it was always hard to decipher if he really did love me or just loved how loyal and caring I’ve been through it all. Anyway, when I told him that he got really quiet….he didn’t say I was wrong or try to change my mind about it- he just kinda shook his head and we changed the subject…I’ve been thinking about that conversation since and deeply regretting it. I’m upset that I let my mother’s words get to me the way it did…I shouldn’t have said that to him. If I had known the extreme pain he was going through at the time- I wouldn’t have.

1ahofh3;I miss my mom.;imafruittt;Im a 19yo woman and only child. My mom committed suicide last april. It seems like the depression faze of greif is hitting me now. Ive felt so alone recently because I feel like no one around me understands how different it feels to lose your mom, someone who knows you inside and out. I spent every moment with my mom. We were codependent. We loved eachother but would hurt eachother alot too. She was the person I would lean on because she understood those hard feelings that I had.  My dad tries to be comforting but it just isnt the same as Im sure some people here could understand. All of my family is greiving and remembering my mom as someone she was 20 years ago when she was healthy and happy. Its hard because I only knew that version of her when I was very young. Sometimes it feels like my 10 year old self is greiving the hardest. Like Im blocking out the bad parts of our relationship. Im curious how some of you have learned to live without someone so important to you. How do you fill that hole that was left. I cant imagine my life without her, without her coming to my softball games or going to my wedding, or seeing me get my GED even.

1ahj589;Scared of everyone I love committing now…;Minute_South_2543;I lost my dad to suicide last June. I don’t feel like I need to explain to you all what that’s like, so I’ll leave it at that. I am the oldest of 5. In the months since my dad died, 2 of my siblings lost friends to suicide. Yesterday, one of those siblings called me and told me he was concerned about a friend. I recognize we are hyper sensitive right now because of my dad but he had legitamite reasons to be concerned and I wanted to out his mind at ease, so I offered to drive him over there. We pulled up to his friends house and his car was in the drive way. My brother had told me he usually leaves his front door unlocked so we weren’t surprised to find it that way and walked in when we got there. My brother was walking through the house yelling his friends name with no response. I knew something was wrong so when he got to his bedroom door I told him to wait and let me check. I cracked the door and stuck my head in and saw his friend laying on the bed dead from a gun shot wound (the same manner as my dad). I shut the door and said “he’s dead we need to call the police.”  He was in disbelief and tried to open the door but I was screaming no and telling him to back up. I called 911 and while I was on the phone he continued to try and get past me and eventually he did. He opened the door and had a brief glance before as able to pull him back. The look on his face really got to me for some reason. He looked so pale and shocked and dazed and like he’d pass out and it just made what we were experiencing so much more real. We waited for police outside at that point. I remember every detail of that. There was no smell when we walked in the house but when we opened the door it hit me hard. In some ways, this made me appreciate my dad more. He drove to an empty parking lot, got out of his car and walked away from it. He left a note and a video apologizing and trying to explain - he didn’t want to hurt us, he was just hurting and struggling so badly and couldn’t handle it bc he was t in his right mind. I understand on some level and I feel he did what he could to try and spare us in some way from seeing it, from messing the car, from feeling like he didn’t care. He used a pistol and the funeral home believed they could make him look presentable. They did, and we were able to say goodbye. This was not like that. It was a shotgun. It was horrendous. Dehumanizing. Traumatizing. I can’t find the right words. He left a note to an ex girlfriend of 6 months… nothing for his family. He did this in his bed knowing his roommate or someone he knew would find him. I have so many conflicting feelings. Something about knowing my brother saw it hurts me so deeply, my little brother who i wanted to protect. I wished so badly he hadn’t. I am hopeful his mind will fully block it out… it was only a second he saw and he mentioned yesterday that he was already beginning to forget. There is another part of me really struggling feeling alone. I feel guilty for feeling this way bc it was his friend, i didn’t know this guy well. But it was so disturbing and shocking it feels so wrong and isolating to have these thoughts in my head. I have the urge to describe the graphic details to others so they understand how horrified I am and the degree of severity. I dont REALLY want this, I dont want to traumatize others… I dont really know what I want. Sorry this is all over the place. It’s still hard to think straight. I feel hyper vigilant right now… the world feels so dark. I’m so scared of everyone I love dying similar horrific deaths and feeling even more alone than I do now. I want to feel close to the people I love but I don’t want to drag them down into this dark place with me.;I lost my dad to suicide last June.

1ahckkm;For the record I really appreciate your friendship.;Badge9987;Just found out a few days ago that a long time friend of mine killed himself.  We never met in person but we talked or texted almost every day.  He always struggled with losing his mom at a young age and would have bouts of depression that would come and go.  A couple times throughout our friendship he told me he was going through some things and if he’s quiet for a while that’s why.  I’d always give him his space and he’d come around a week or two later and things were fine.  He texted me something to that effect a couple weeks ago, and I hadn’t heard from him in a while.  Worried, I searched around online and there it was, his obituary.  He died 4 days after we last talked.  I wish I could have done something or been a better friend.  The title of this post was his last text message to me, and I just keep staring at it and it hurts so much to know that’s the end of it.  He left behind a teenage daughter who was everything to him and I just hope she doesn’t have the same struggle he did.;Just found out a few days ago that a long time friend of mine killed himself.

1ah3b4o;Lost my best friend last year;riverirvine;I'm coming up to a year since my best friend took his own life and while I'm struggling more than I ever have in my life I have a weird sense of rejuvenation within life. It's a very conflicting feeling as id much rather my best friend still be here and while I get dark periods when I feel angry, upset, hurt or feeling like I have to live with a huge emotional scar, I also have learnt to love and cherish everything more. I've opened up in ways I never could have and will never take any relationships for granted. To me I'll never be able to tell my friend how much I love and care for him so it's my driving force to put that energy into the people around me. By no means am I ok with this all but I suppose I just wanted to share how I've been dealing with things these past 10 months and hope that people can find some comfort in that bereavement isnt all dark and gloomy and I've managed to gain some positivity from the worst experience of my life.A bit of context my friend and I were best mates for 20 years and he tried on multiple occasions where I helped him recover various different ways. I've lost a part of myself that I will never get back and while he's physically gone he remains a fixture of my brain which can be comforting and torturous at the same time. He was on medication, in therapy and was even turned away from a mental hospital and in the UK you can be seen to be doing everything in your power to improve your situation but it still isn't enough. I just wish we could go back to being 7 where things didn't matter and all we did is play football together against the wall outside my mums house.;I'm coming up to a year since my best friend took his own life and while I'm struggling more than I ;;9;21;2024-02-02 13:10:28;2024-02-02;Friday;13:10:28;1627;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:16.713479

1aguwef;Hoping to get some guidance;anon_123_pleze;Hi,I lost a very good friend of almost 15 years to suicide a little over two weeks ago.He was an ex boyfriend with very deep feelings. We wanted different things in life. I wanted kids and he did not. Other than that we were perfect together and complimented each other well. I broke things off because I didn’t want to forego children. We stayed very close.He moved his girlfriend in during Covid and proposed a little over a year ago after an ultimatum but had no plans to marry. I stopped responding to him in July in order to let myself fully move on, him be happy, and also out of a little spite/childish behavior on my end. He last reached out to me in October and I didn’t respond again…He chose to end his life on January 13th. I have so many questions that will go unanswered. So many regrets. So many what if’s. I also found out he had tried three days before and the fiance didn’t tell anyone. So many people would have come to help. I didn’t know but he had been in a deep depression for the last 6 months and I can’t help but feel that I contributed. One more person who moved on from him… I also found out his father died by suicide when he was 13. I knew his dad died but he never shared the exact cause- just always said his dad had been sick for a very long time. I suspected suicide but was never sure. It was very secretive in his family and he had no outlet. I now know the reason he didn’t want kids was because of this. He didn’t want to pass this on to them.I feel so terrible. Have so much guilt. Have so many regrets. Am heartbroken. I almost reached out tohim the day before he did it, but decided against it.I just don’t know who to express all of this to. Thank you for listening. I miss him so much and wish I could do so many things differently.;Hi,I lost a very good friend of almost 15 years to suicide a little over two weeks ago.He was an ex ;;1;2;2024-02-02 04:12:26;2024-02-02;Friday;04:12:26;1775;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:16.714730

The cat moved as we drove past. I screamed, it was agony. I had to get my daughter to school, but I drove back by the scene to see if I could do anything for the cat. It was clear that the poor thing could not be saved. 2.5 months ago my brother shot himself in the head. He had red hair, just like the tabby’s. I knew the cat would be a trigger, but I was so determined to face it and not let it hurt me. Unfortunately, I now realize that it’s not my choice.

In the video his last words were “I love you, I’m sorry, oh god.” It replays in my head over and over. Of course, he would never have meant to cause that pain by posting it. He called his friend, who lived out of state, and his friend heard him die on the phone. I just feel so sad, and I get flashes of that imagery.

1agsd9q;Maybe something that could help others?;Impressive-Thing-483;Not getting into details here, but long story short, I’ve lost two close family members to suicide (my dad from alcoholism at age 46 (I consider this suicide, you don’t have to), and my brother at age 18). My whole immediate family has been suicidal, and I’ve attempted as have my brother and possibly my sister, though I’ve never asked her. We are stable now, still depressed sometimes but overall in good places.I just wanted to say that, if you haven’t been suicidal, it might be really hard to understand that moment of truly considering taking your own life. For me, I was 13. My older brother was 15 when he attempted. I can’t speak for anyone else, but for me, it was blinding. I wasn’t myself, but I felt like the most “myself” I could be. It felt like the entire world was collapsing around me and the only solution was to remove myself from it. And I knew my family might be sad, but they’d move on. (Side note: they do not move on, not really.) It’s really something indescribable for me, but it also helped me understand my brother’s death. In that moment, and other moments before that, the only solution, in his head, was to die. It didn’t matter if he could have help, that he had things he wanted to do, places he wanted to see, etc. Nothing mattered except that goal of not being here. The best way to describe it is tunnel vision—you see nothing else but that. And if you do something you can’t take back, it’s not possible to get help then. I’m not sure if this helps anyone, but maybe someone can read this and know that someone taking their life has nothing to do with how loved they are, how much support they have, etc. It is something that you feel you can’t escape, even if there’s an answer/solution/someone to help. Your actions or lack of actions have nothing to do with it. It’s a really hard thing to accept, and I’m still struggling with it.Please note this is just my experience, I don’t speak for everyone or anyone except myself 🩷;Not getting into details here, but long story short, I’ve lost two close family members to suicide (;;2;9;2024-02-02 02:02:50;2024-02-02;Friday;02:02:50;1964;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:16.723806
1agosxc;Don’t know how to cope;Icy_Imagination_2081;My boyfriend and I immigrated which is a tough one as it is. My uncle and aunt were the ones who helped us get here and we have been staying with them. Less than 2 months after arriving my aunt committed suicide. We’ve both just started new jobs in a new country. My boyfriend and I had gone away with some friends for New Year’s Eve and were coming home on New Year’s Day when I got a call from my uncle to say come home there’s an emergency. I could tell something was wrong by his voice but the phone signal was so bad we kept driving to try get signal at first I thought something was wrong with him, eventually the lady from the ambulance service messaged me from his phone saying there was an incident with my aunt and to come home as soon as I can, then she also called me and at that point I still had no idea what was going on as she didn’t tell me. We were about 30 mins away from home drove as fast as we could with every possible thought running through our heads but not once did I think suicide. We got home saw so many police cars and ambulances outside the house, it still didn’t register in my brain, got inside and the look of absolute devastation on my uncles face is something that will haunt me forever, still didn’t register what was going on, everyone was in the lounge and the ambulance staff looked at me and said do you know what’s happened I said no, they took me to another room and told me and I just kept saying I don’t understand and I still don’t understand. They had a fight in the morning over something so stupid, both of them said horrible things to each other her and then separated as you do when you’ve had a fight. My uncle went downstairs and was cleaning and my aunty went upstairs to their bedroom. About 45 minutes passed my uncle went upstairs to say sorry and he found her, she was already gone, she was already cold. She hung herself. I just don’t understand. She was such a kind hearted person, so full of life. I absolutely cannot wrap my head around it, why she would do something like that over such a silly fight. The police handled it terribly, at one point on the day the policeman held the dressing gown belt that she had used in the evidence bag right in front of all of us. The officer had asked for a charger for his work phone and in a daze my boyfriend went upstairs to grab one and he saw her on the floor, I don’t understand how they let him go upstairs. The coroner took my uncles phone instead of my aunts (without even telling us) and I spent the next couple of days phoning around desperately trying to figure out what happened to his phone. When we came back to the house about a week later we were cleaning up their bedroom and my boyfriend found the note that she had left, we knew my uncle couldn’t see it because she was so angry when she wrote it. It was such a traumatic thing to go through, we are both so young and had no idea what to do. I just feel that should have been something that the police should have looked for instead of us finding it. Who knows what would have happened if my uncle found that note on the day. I just don’t know how to cope with all of this. My mom committed suicide when I was a baby so at least I don’t remember anything I guess but amongst the many other traumatic things I have gone through in my life how do I get passed this. I just keep asking why, the note was not the why we were all looking for either. I held my uncle whilst he cried shaking morning and night and I just don’t know how to process all of this. Why did she do this to us. She was so excited for us to move here, it was only the beginning and now she is gone.;My boyfriend and I immigrated which is a tough one as it is.

I miss talking to him about happy moments in my day, and telling him that I wished he was with me to experience it. I miss him telling me about a beautiful thing he saw at work, and wishing I was with him to see it too. I miss that feeling of wanting to share good moments with someone simply because they feel good, and you want them to feel good too. I don’t miss him because he’s dead necessarily, but I miss him not being around. Like if your best friend went on a vacation somewhere where there was no wifi or way to contact them. You wish you could talk to them about everything but you can’t because there’s no way to, so just wait for them to come back. Except that vacation is forever for me and him. I just talk to the sky now, hoping he can hear me talk about the pretty flower I saw, or the movie I just watched which I know he would have loved, or the new song his favorite artist just dropped, or the two birds I saw fighting.

I’ve had quite a few people ask me what happened to him. I’m struggling with how to respond. His smile could light up any room, he was always the life of the party and everyone wanted to be around him. So it makes sense that they want to know - even if they haven’t spoken to him in years. How do you respond when asked what happened to your loved one? Do you just say they died by suicide, do you say it in another way?;The love of my life died by suicide at the end of last year.

1agfvxt;My heart hurts;pink-dustbin;"It's been 2.5 months now. One of my best friends took his life in a violent and abrupt way. His wife left him, he had a falling out with his best friend and lived alone in a different country. I knew he was suicidal, i think i was the only person he confided in about his previous attempt and ideations (his wife won't talk to me now). I checked up on him everyday. I talked to him the day before. I texted him the day after and got no response. Literally on the only day I didn't text him he went and did this. I told him ""okay take care"" on the last text I sent him, after wanting to say ""i love you"" but didn't say it. I wish I had. I know everyone says you shouldn't blame yourself but realistically only i could have done something. Only i knew.

When did you notice you were coping better?I seem to think things can’t get any worse then I have a day where it is, I know it’s still fresh but are we talking months, years?I’m really struggling, there’s a drop in group session for people bereaved by suicide on the 12th I’m going to try and go too (depending on childcare) and I have an assessment for some 1-1 work next week. They asked me what I needed help with but I don’t actually know? Other than somehow finding a way to bring him back I don’t know what will help me right now? I seem to be thinking way in the future the past few days, like when our boy is talking and asking where’s daddy? He probably won’t asl that question for a good couple years so I don’t know why I’m so focused on it. I just want him back, nothing and literally not one single bit of my life makes sense without him. Everyone thinks I’m holding it together but I’m not? I’m just on autopilot, if I didn’t have our son to look after I literally wouldn’t be getting out of bed. I’m not just getting on with things because I want too, I have no choice?

1ag469d;My sister;No-Special3090;"(I apologize in advance if this is a bit incoherent, I am not the greatest writer and I'm doing this with a lot of things racing through my mind)She had called me one day after work (I'm a high school grad on a gap year) after not talking to my family for about a month. She told me she had attempted to commit suicide in early December, taking a bunch of Benadryl, which ultimately failed and left her hospitalized for 8 days. I was the first to know of any of this. My sister and I were especially close as children, we played with our stuffed animals, played Minecraft and were cast in Peter Pan Jr as small children together. When I got to high school I felt we drifted apart, I was obsessed with being cool and my lame theater kid, crew rowing sister didn't cut it for me. That all changed within the last year, I graduated high school early and started my gap year working for an engineering company with my sister (she had taken 2 gap years) and everyday we drove to work together. I began to remember and rekindle the bond we had as children, I called it our ""redemption arc"".  So when I heard her tell me about her attempt my heart dropped, this was just the beginning of our lives and we were finally back together after my delusional high school self had wrecked our relationship.  I planned to travel down to her dorm, to stay with her under the veil that it was just because I wanted some help with my college applications (she went to a selective university) but really because I wanted to spend time with her and make sure she was ok. I regret not communicating this to her, one of my many regrets. Maybe I didn't relay my feelings to her well but I didn't want to come off as pushy or too nosy. I got there on the 23rd of December (she had refused to come home for Christmas) after taking the bus, the first long trip alone in my life. When she greeted me I tried to hug her but she didn't really hug me back and seemed distant. We toured the college. She showed me a lab she was working in aptly named the ""breakerspace"" a joke on a ""makerspace"" as the lab was for destroying materials and stress testing. We looked at a piece of wood with an electron microscope admiring the individual cells with the incredibly powerful zoom.  The next two days (Christmas Eve and Christmas) weren't as great. She disappeared for both of them, taking her bottles of antidepressants with her and I freaked out both times. The first time she came back after 2 AM sometime as I fell asleep at 2 AM, I don't know where she went that day and I suppose I never will. The second day I decided to leave her dorm room and search for her. I found her on the first floor of the building watching Harry Potter with some friends. But I had made a fatal mistake: In my panic I had called my parents and spilled the beans about her suicide attempt, a secret she entrusted with me. After finishing the movie we went back upstairs (her room was on the fourth floor) and I told her what I had done. I told her of the panic of her leaving and not responding to my texts and phone calls. After crying for a bit because of my mistake she told me she forgave me. She looked at me and said ""Matthew, I am fine I don't need you to worry about me so much."" I believed her. I never freaked out over her leaving again. I ended up finishing my college essays and after hanging out with her for 2 more days said my goodbyes. I returned home, my mother picked me up because I forgot to buy a bus ticket. My sister didn't want to see her nor our dog that my mom had brought with her. My mom brought some food with her to give to my sister but the jar had leaked all over my laundry basket. As I went back up to say my final goodbye and what would be the last time I ever saw my sister. We cleaned a laundry basket of the juices from the jar. Perhaps a metaphor of us kids cleaning up after our parents after they tried to help us. We ended up talking everyday by phone, either about my college stuff or just life. The last time we called was January 2nd, a quick 10 minute call about a mistake I had made with one of my college apps that I wanted advice with.  Two days later, on January 4th, she would kill herself, overdosing on her antidepressants. We found out on January 8th. I received a panicked call from my father stating to come home early from work as there was an emergency. I was on top of the world, just finishing my college applications and beginning a new engineering project at my job, a PCB to control an environmental chamber coincidentally a design my sister had started during her time at the company. I will never forget the look in my fathers eyes after I walked in the side door of our house when he said ""She did it, she is dead.""With hindsight I regret a lot of things. I believe I could've saved her if I just articulated how much I cared about her. Maybe I am foolish for believing that but I think I was the one she trusted, the one she reached out to and she didn't think I cared about her and I stupidly broke her trust. So the timeline is clear this all happened within the last two months. I haven't returned to my job, its been about a month now and every night (including this night) I think about her and my mind goes to dark places. I'm not a frequent reddit user but if some parts of the story are unclear I'll try to respond to clear things up. I didn't really touch on this and I would prefer not to but my sister and I don't really have a great relationship with our parents so that's where the laundry basket metaphor thing came from. Thank you for this reddit I think sharing my story has, at least in this moment, given me some peace about this.";(I apologize in advance if this is a bit incoherent, I am not the greatest writer and I'm doing this;;2;15;2024-02-01 06:05:40;2024-02-01;Thursday;06:05:40;5661;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:16.733378

1af69x0;Becoming a monster;Frosted_Coal;This Friday during my regular therapy session we ended up talking about my dad again who left in August. He didn't leave a note or any evidence that he planned it. I know you can tie yourself in knots trying to figure out why but I ended up talkin about reasons why I thought he did it.He had MS and scaring on his brain which caused him to blow up quickly. My brother and mum said he was having more agruments with mum and then crying later and apologising desperately pleading for my mum not to leave him. Despite my mum always reassuring she wouldn't, that she knew it wasn't all him but the disease.I think he was escaping from the monster he thought he was becoming. From the angry man who came out more and more. I can't help but think this was the only way out he saw, not wiling to live with the idea that,  despite the reassurance, my mum would leave he would be alone.It hurts so much to think he reached that level of frustration and pain. This escape feels like a vampire choosing to sit in the sun to spare their loved ones. It feels surreal yet it makes sense. It makes me so heartbroken that this is the only way he could think to escape. I know I'll never know why and I try not to speculate but this creeping thought hasn't left me in days. I suppose posting it here is throw it out of my head or to see if it will fade back to the dusty corners of my mind.;This Friday during my regular therapy session we ended up talking about my dad again who left in Aug;;2;10;2024-01-31 02:04:01;2024-01-31;Wednesday;02:04:01;1374;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:17.962565

1af4nvt;How the hell do we tell our kids?;iwasleftbehindbyhim;My brother died on December 12th. He left behind a 3 year old daughter and my son is 6. His wife has decided she doesn’t want to tell their daughter the truth about how he died. Not yet at least. She doesn’t want her to know. So because of that we are hesitant to say anything to my son who’s 6 and might in turn say something about it to his cousin. So I’m sort of stuck. When he first died we just said “he had an accident” and kept it at that. We didn’t elaborate. But tonight he started asking “how did he die?” And we just reiterated that he had an accident but he kept insisting “yeah but HOW did he have an accident” We have absolutely no idea what to say or how to approach it. If it wasn’t for the situation with my sister in law wanting to shield their daughter I think I’d be a little more comfortable with saying something along the lines of “he was sick and his sickness told his brain to hurt himself” or something.

1adzpfo;What hurts the most;elusive_emo;Everything about this hurts, obviously, but I think the worst part is thinking about the future and the things you'll never get to see or experience. Games and movies you looked forward to have been released since you passed. You bought me a game that month so we could play it together, but we never got the chance. Part of me wants to experience these things in your honor, but at the same time, part of me feels sick just thinking about it. I can't touch the old games and movies that remind me of you, either. Maybe one day.    I told you I could never imagine a life without you in it. That remained true even in the wake of our separation. Though no longer together, you were still my best friend and would have remained so for the rest of our lives. You told me you had better be invited to my wedding, that you wanted to walk me down the aisle... and now you'll never get to. You'll never see me start a family, meet my future children, and be a great uncle to them as you have been to your sister's kids.    My birthday has come and passed - the first one since you've been gone. With it came the sickening realization that, though you're older than me, the gap between us is gradually closing.

1adsuia;Can't help but feel nothing (TW: abuse);Weirdedout4life;I lost my uncle to suicide in 2020 and I was most upset at the time because my cousin was now fatherless and without a supportive mother. My cousin all by himself and we tried taking him in but he was emotionally abusive towards my sibling and had a lot of deep seated issues my family wasn't equipped to deal with so he lives with his grandpa now. I didn't get to know my uncle too well but I'd either constantly hear about how great he was or how shitty of a father he was. He helped people get back on their feet and have better lives but he'd always come home to his abusive wife and he'd often take his anger out on his children as if the abuse they received from their mother wasn't enough. I feel sad that I never got to know the better side of him people spoke of and only saw glimpses of him at family gatherings and my most positive memory was of him hugging me and my brother and him telling us how much he loved us...But now I can't help but feel not much of anything.

1adft1y;I lost my significant other (of 6 years) to suicide. I’m completely shattered and don’t know how to continue.;Bunnboop;I’m a female, just turned 21. I lost my boyfriend of six years (aged 22) to suicide two months ago.I’m broken. I’m completely shattered. I don’t know how am I supposed to continue living.We both suffer from mental illnesses, I was under strict supervision for a few years because of an ED, so I got diagnosed with a few different types of ED’s, adjustment disorders, ocd, derealization, depression, severe anxiety and panic disorder, later on with a few other stuff but you get the gist..My bf was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and ever since I met him I knew he struggled with depression, some kind of dissociative disorder, and suicidal thoughts.He was my soulmate. We met when I was 14 and he was 15. We’ve been (almost) inseparable ever since. We were always joking about finding each other so early on in life (I was his first girlfriend and he was my second partner). We were planning on getting married, having kids together, growing old together…I guess that you guys understand that the story is very complex and I would probably miss a lot of details, apologies in advance.In the months leading to him choosing to “leave”.. I was falling in love with him deeper and deeper every single day, and I made sure he knew that. He was having episodes of very bad dissociation and depression and was noticeably having a hard time. Me and his best friend really pushed him to try and be more vocal about his feelings, but he was having a very hard time expressing himself too. I knew he needed time and professional help and that it would probably get better slowly but surely, I had hope for him and he did too, at least I thought so.I know about his suicidal tendencies, and throughout our relationship he was close to going through with it at least 4 different times, but happily chose to continue trying to live life.I remember sitting him down after he would tell me about his suicidal thoughts, and promising him that if he’ll EVER DARE do something to himself, that my suicide would be on his shoulders too, because I couldn’t see my life without him. I made him swear that he understands and that he’s not planning to go through with any plans. And he swore.I promised him that no matter what, I will always be by his side and always love him unconditionally. We’ve been through so much together.I had a very serious knee injury and got hospitalized for almost two months, in that time we talked every day, he would come and visit when he could, and we saw anime “together” from afar…Right when I finally got discharged from the hospital, I went back home to him and his roommate (we 3 live together), and noticed that he (my bf) was acting kind of off…if only I picked up on it sooner….For example. I needed a few weeks of home recovery, and had to keep one of my legs straight at all times. So he would help me get to the shower and later treat the wound I still had from the injury. But he was very careless about the way he was treating me, which was odd to me to say the least. Small stuff - like he left the wrapper and the torn box of the bandages on the floor, although there was a trash can right next to him. It may sound small, but it’s just not like him to litter the house like that.On the second day of me being home, my bf woke up early and left to work. He was supposed to be back at 2pm max. But then another hour rolled around, and another one rolled around, and another….I was getting a bad feeling in my stomach, he wasn’t answering my massages so I called him, and his phone line was not active.And then it clicked.I broke down sobbing, I knew he did it. Or was on the e way to commit. I just knew it.Our roommate took charge and made me stay in my room with his mother and my best friend. We gave the police statements and I’m not going to write the anymore about that horrible day. But I knew he wasn’t going to come back.He was missing for 3 days, and was found dead in a city far away from us. My mom and dad came to bring me the news. I just froze, my heart sank and shattered, and I got into shock. Was completely dissociated.Now back to the present. I couldn’t imagine his face, my brain would just block it automatically. Until a few days ago. Every thing reminds me of him, no matter how small. And I just break down sobbing and yelling crying uncontrollably.He didn’t leave a note, nothing. I was left with so many unanswered questions from the person who was my home for the longest time. I feel helpless. I have an amazing support system, but it’s still so difficult. I’ve changed for the worst, lost all motivation, lost all will to live and fight. He was my rock. And now he’s gone forever.All I know is that he’s in a better place now. rest in peace my beautiful angel, no matter where you are right now, even if it’s nothing, ik it’s what was best for you. you will forever be a piece missing from my heart. I miss you so so much.I am in treatment, psychotherapy and by a psychiatrist. But I would love to hear if you have any advise for me. I’m completely lost.;I’m a female, just turned 21.

I have never made a post on reddit before but I feel like I just need to get this off my chest. I spent the last hour and a half uncontrollably sobbing in my room - I am a wreck and just need to talk to someone.My best friend killed themself a year ago and I have been fucked up since. Words will never even begin to explain the pain and hurt I feel without him in this world. We grew up together and were incredibly close in highschool. He was easily the most popular kid in our town - absolute stud (he could get any girl he ever wanted, he literally was a model), incredible athlete (football, lacrosse, climbing, surfing, you name it), brilliant (was studying nueroscience in college), and really just of the greatest people I ever met. We had so many incredible times together, he was just one of those people that made any activity fun. When we graduated highschool, our friend group went to Europe for a few weeks and it was probably the best time of my life. Traveling another continent with you best buds, exploring new people and places - there is really nothing like it. Anyway, that summer was really the last time I connected with him. After that, we entered our freshman year of college and drifted. He was in colorado, in a frat, seemingly having the best time of his life, while I went to a college in california and struggled to find friends I resonated with and enjoy my experience there. I struggled with thoughts of self-doubt and depression since I was having such a hard time at school, so when I saw him partying with all of his new homies in college, I distanced myself because it made me feel even shittier about myself. I reached out less throughout the semester and over breaks, I only saw him a few times over our winter break... whenever I saw him, he would talk about how awesome college was and it just made me think of how shitty I must be since I wasn't able to make friends and enjoy college like him or the rest of my hometown buddies.After winter break, we returned to school and about two weeks in, I get a call saying that he hung himself in his shower. My heart broke into a million pieces. I was immediately flooded with feelings of guilt, shock, horror, and pain. I couldn't understand it - from the outside, he appeared to be having an incredible time in college, living the life I dreamed about. He was the ABSOLUTE LAST person I could have ever expected to do this.Over this last year, I have struggled with feelings of depression, pain, anger, and guilt. I hate myself for how I acted before he passed. What kind of friend stops reaching out to his best friend because he is jealous of him?? I am a fucking terrible person. I would give up anything to get the chance to rectify my actions. All the money in the world would mean nothing compared to having him back. My depression has spiraled since then.. I have had a really hard time loving or even liking myself. I just have so much guilt and pain inside of me. I wan't there for him when he needed me - That is the most important role of a friend, to be there for your buddies. to reach out to them and make sure they are doing well.I just can't get over it. I think about him every single day, without fail. He is constantly on my mind. Even now, in college (where I have found good friends and cultivated a life for myself) I still struggle so much mentally. I don't know what else I can do. It's so hard to live like this... I feel like a husk of my former self. I know you can't rush loss but it is just so overwhelming and I just want things to go back to the way they were in highschool. I miss when my biggest worry was whether the girl in the back of my history class thought I was cute. I miss going on adventures with my friend. I miss watching sunset with the boys. I miss pulling up to school late and seeing him in the lot also looking for a spot. I miss all the boys jumping into the back of his tiny car to get lunch at our favorite spot.I just miss my friend so much.;I'm not sure why I am writing this.

I was put on a couple different medications that help. When I was young I coped with trauma by creating a fantasy world or made up scenarios of why things happened the way they did. For example “Maybe our dad wasn’t our real dad? And somewhere out there was a good father looking for us.”  Which was absolutely was NOT the case.For the first time in decades, my brain has started trying to rewrite reality mixing in small details like the window being unlocked not being able to find one gold ring and his switch to justify it.“Someone went and bought the alcohol, came in threw the window ,forced him to write 30 different letters and then ended him in the basement and staged the scene, stole some things, left out the window”I know that scenario didn’t happen.It just creeps into my head (every day)  when it’s too overwhelming thinking he left us by his own choice and the way he did it. I hate reality and now having to fight off a complete made up one. Either way he’s gone.

1acttky;Nothing seems to ease the pain;98542643;It's almost 3 months since he took his life. I know that's still pretty fresh, but I can't imagine it getting too much better. Especially considering what everyone who's years out say.  I feel unworthy of even trying to live. I feel obligated to feel the same intensity of emotional turmoil he went through before meeting a similar fate... I feel hopeless. I don't even wish for happiness or a relationship anymore like I used to. I think I've accepted that life is shit and that I'll always be alone, and I'm ok with that. I used to feel jealous when I'd see happy couples, but now I don't particularly care... I feel so much guilt. I personally feel like I killed him, for missing all his obvious signs. I literally did. It is what it is, I'm not expecting anyone to say otherwise, I've already accepted that too. I don't mean to be such a pessimist, it's just that nothing anyone says seems to get through to me. The worst part is that I miss him and it breaks my heart that I couldn't protect him, it breaks my heart thinking about how trapped, lonely, scared he must've felt, and then on top of it all, I don't even know what I meant to him. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter. My love for him is unconditional and it doesn't matter if he liked me or valued me or was just with me out of convenience.... but some days, it's all just too much to bear. It just feels like a lose/lose trying to figure out my role in all this... if he killed himself because of me, then fuck me... if he killed himself irrespective of me, then fuck me too.. 'cause I wasn't enough for him to stick around for. I feel insecure of myself... I feel like a hazard to the people around me 'cause I couldn't even recognize the most textbook signs of suicide... I feel like I'll never be enough for someone. Like, I can't even bring someone I loved so much happiness. I feel so flawed.. I find no comfort in anything.;It's almost 3 months since he took his life.

I was not soft enough with him a week before he took his life. I was mean. I was tired of his behavior and how it was impacting our lives. How stupid of me.  I told him to get help many times and I even told him to go to his mom or have his mom come here. I needed someone’s support to help support him. He refused and it was a lot at home. But I tried loving him and showing him I care so much. But there was times when I was mean. I was really mean. But mostly it was when I needed to sleep and he would constantly wake me up. There wasn’t one day that he was fine. We couldn’t have one single normal conversation. I was busy and tired all day and night from taking care of our baby. And then on top of that, I was taking care of him. Because of how he was acting, he was almost about to lose his job as well. His performance was bad and that was also stressing him out. But I keep blaming me. If I was softer maybe he would have gotten out of this and we could have gotten him the help he needed. He needed me to be nicer. He needed me to give him hope because he didn’t have that left anymore. I feel like I don’t ever deserve to be happy. I don’t want to find happiness.

1acdtb8;Delayed reaction;_clur_510;Did anyone else seem to have a delayed reaction to the loss of their loved one? My fiancé/partner of 9 years took his life a little over a year ago. I functioned for about six months after that.

About six months later it hit me like a ton of bricks. Since the summer I have been in and out of inpatient psych ward stays (6 or 7 total), I can’t keep a job, I’m drinking like a sailor, I had to move home with my parents (I’m 30),  none of my friends really speak to me anymore because I can’t even really have a conversation with my loved ones because I feel so detached from the world everyone else seems to live in. I feel as though I spent the first six months trying to accept that this was a suicide. That he would do this. That this is how his story ends. He was a fun, happy, confident, life of the party type of personality. Very social and very street/person smart. Countless amount of socioeconomically, racially, sexually oriented, diverse friends. There were roughly 700 people at his funeral. It was shocking this is how his story ends. I feel like once I had the chance to accept the suicide aspect of the death, the death and permanency of what happened finally sunk in.

1aca1hw;It’s been 2 months;IllustriousArt8152;It’s been 2 months and I always go back and forth over and over “ there’s nothing you could have done” right back to thinking there’s some way I could have prevented this. My fiance and I were with him the night before. We dropped him home in the morning - his parents were at his house visiting from Cali so we thought he would be okay. He was going through it- a divorce, his ex trying to take his son. We knew how he was feeling but we didn’t want to call a doctor or something like that because we thought it would affect the custody case. Obviously now I wish I did something more. That night I should have gave him one last hug but I went to bed and he talked with my fiance all night. I should have hugged him more. Maybe he would have felt more love? I don’t know. I’m always going to feel like I could have saved him. Does this ever stop? He was at our house everyday almost with his son just hanging out. He was going to be my fiancés best man at our wedding- now that day is going to be incomplete without him. How could he do this to us? His son? Everyone who loved him? He was so loved. I wish he knew that he was going to get through the divorce and get his son back!! It was only temporary- we talked to him for hours and hours trying to help. We thought we did. The day before he asked me if my parents were together. I said no they are divorced. He said “you know I think I’m getting used to this- I can get through it a lot of people are divorced.” I don’t understand and never will. And that’s the worst part.

Sometimes she’d get so sick from not eating or would be beaten by her parents I let her stay at my house until the situation smoothed over I liked taking care of her and I hope she felt loved when I did. I also took her virginity one time when she came over to my house and we had sex but that sounds so crude so I’d rather say we made love together. Anyways that night I felt extremely connected to her. At school one day we were walking home and the sunlight was beautiful shining onto her skin and hair and I kissed her and she blushed and looked at me bashfully, i remember that moment so vividly it’s a very intimate and happy moment for me in my life. One day she gave me her clothing and diary and told me to Keep it I asked why but she told me I’d find out this struck me as odd but I didn’t probe any further I figured she wanted me to keep something of her to remember her for some reason but I didn’t yet know why. On October 3rd she invited me to her house for a date as her parents had left home for the weekend. She told me to wait outside her room for a minute I turned around once and when she came back out she had a shotgun I was shocked and felt unable to move I didn’t know what was going on but I knew it wouldn’t end good I didn’t plead or beg with her I just stood there in shock and confusion she put the barrel in  her mouth she pulled the trigger in front of me her blood got on my shoes and her diary that I was going to return to her as I felt she should’ve kept her own diary. I called 911 still in deeper shock at this point and they brought her body out of the house and inspected the scene  I was asked to leave her mother called me a week later to come to the funeral but my mother didn’t let me attend since my mom said she was busy at the time and didn’t have time to drag me to a funeral so I never got to go. I wish I went to this day I feel so horrible like i could’ve done something like i should’ve picked up on the signs  or something but it was all futile in the end it’s not my fault I know that but I feel like it is and the grief sticks with me year in and year out I miss her more each year that goes by we talked about graduation together but that never happened obviously;TW for suicide, graphic detail, graphic depictions of suicideSo in middle school to early highschool;;1;14;2024-01-26 21:28:22;2024-01-26;Friday;21:28:22;2997;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:18.012976

I don’t know why, I can’t understand it. You always seemed so confident in who you were. You had every reason to be, you were so beautiful, inside and out. I never told you that all of my friends who had met you fell head over heels for you. I wish I did, maybe it would have made you feel better, even just for a second. How did I get so lucky to have such a great brother? So selfless, kind, witty. You always put everyone first, and yourself last. I loved that about you, but I wish you put yourself first. You were more than deserving of it. You truly had no flaws, but you thought you were the most flawed out of everyone. I know you felt worthless. I know you always loved more than you were loved. I know you were hurt and betrayed too many times. I know you felt like love wasn’t real.I get so angry thinking of how badly they treated you. How they made you think you were nothing. How they made you think you weren’t special. You thought no one would ever care about you. I would have taken all the pain you had in you and kept it myself for the rest of my life if it meant that you could be free, if it meant that you could finally be happy. I would have given up anything, done anything for you brother. You said you weren’t worth being loved. It breaks my heart to know you felt that way about yourself. Don’t you know how fucking special you are?? No one deserved you. This world didn’t deserve you. Even I didn’t deserve a brother like you. My sweet brother. I need to see you again one day.

We would have played Mario kart and mortal Kombat and watched movie after movie. He would have kept me close to him and I wouldn't have left his side unless it was to the restroom or grab more to drink and snack on. And of course today, of all days my youngest tells me she misses him. I can barely hold it together. I can barely breathe without him. I always saw myself as a pretty optimistic person and now the only phrase that gets me through the day is to just repeat to myself that I just have to get through this second. One day the pain won't feel so intense one day my heart won't feel like it's completely shattered.

I genuinely would like some advice as I am unsure what to do.To recap my day, I (F21 ) made my way to work and tried to shake off what I was feeling but this one coworker (M28) tends to emotionally dump a lot. It’s been that way since I started last summer. At first it was manageable but it progressively got worse on his first night out where he got very drunk and started heavily dumping and hitting on every girl in a very sloppy fashion, including me but in a more backhanded way. People spoke amongst themselves and had their opinions but ultimately forgave his actions until he did it again. He was in a very bad state of mind and would ultimately mention that to me for months. Around that time my brother had a failed suicide attempt and I was shaken because I had to talk him out of it. He would still emotionally dump on me around that time and it was extremely difficult to remain calm as I was afraid for my brother’s life. My brother had an unfortunate successful attempt which lead me to take time off. I’ve been back for around 3 months and he started the moment I came back. Today was extremely tough due to him sharing that he had plans and speaking to me multiple times for minutes ranging from 5 to 40ish minutes at a time. Other factors exasperated my emotions but this has been a very long issue.I’m really afraid for him and my coworkers have mentioned that I should talk to management as they’ve noticed that too. Some if not most are not fond of him for understandable reasons.  I feel extremely bad for him as he feels left out and could perhaps miss social cues but it’s getting to a point where I feel like I’m reliving my trauma.;I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit.

I wish people would talk to me about it, or just ask me how I’m doing. Instead everyone keeps their mouths shut and no one wants to bring it up. When I talk about it with my therapist I feel validated and like someone hears me. But with my friends and family, everyone’s too afraid to talk to me about it. So I’m just stuck in my head all alone, all these feelings and thoughts that I can’t share with others because I know no one wants to hear it. If I do say something about my mom or how she died, I’m met with silence and pity. I don’t want that. So instead I’ll rant about it on the internet to strangers.

How do you convey the tragic loss of suicide? At least my dad lived 90 long years of life. That was a loss/death that made sense. To family and friends. To me. People know how to console the natural loss of an elderly parent or family member.But. My nephew… He had a whole life ahead of him. It’s unfathomable. That he’s gone. That he chose to exit this life. I can’t imagine any kind conversation right now. With anyone. Except for with my sister (his mom). But I don’t want to/can’t unload on her.I just want to hide. To be alone. Everything seems so trivial. So petty. I can’t go to my normal coffee shop. My gym. Because I can’t hide my pain. My sadness. And I don’t want to explain it either.

I wish I could go back to when nobody expected us to be stronger.People ask ""if you could go back in time and make different choices, would you?"". And like, I know the ""right"" answer is to say no, because we wouldn't be the people we are today if we did. But god... I wouldn't even hesitate. Not for a second. I would go back and I don't think I could regret it.Anyway, my 25th birthday is coming up in 2 weeks. And honestly, I don't want it. The only reason I cared about my birthday was because she cared. She loved birthdays; not her own, but her loved ones'. She loved making these wonderful, elaborate, hand-made gifts and organizing the perfect day for each person she loved.So, subconsciously, she made me love my birthday. The last birthday we shared, she wrote me a million cheesy little notes in colorful paper, twisted to look like tiny streamers. One of them said she couldn't wait to spend all of our years together for the rest of our lives.She ended her life 5 months later.21st of July, 2021. She was 21 years old.I can't want my birthday. My family wants it, my friends want it. They get upset because I don't. If I could give it to them, I would. But I can't; it's a freaking birthday. It feels like everybody wants to leave her behind. They want me to move on, build a life. But that's bull, isn't it? It feels like it is. Because I don't want to forget her. I don't want the world to forget her. She was too kind and too precious and too good for the world to forget her.I don't want to celebrate my birthday. And last year, they threw me a surprise party. I had a panic attack in the bathroom and then I dried my eyes and went back out to try so hard to smile and act grateful for 4 hours. Because I knew they meant well. But the cake felt like a weight in my mouth that I couldn't swallow. I honestly don't remember anything else.And I'm scared they'll go against my wishes again. I'm scared I'll realize that no one is actually listening to me. That even if I've had conversations with all of them, trying to convince them to ignore the fact that 25 years ago my mom gave birth to me, they will still go through with it. Cake and balloons and all of that.Because it would mean they didn't listen.... I just had a thought. Would it be crazy if I went to visit the cemetery for, like, most of the day? Just avoid being home. I honestly just want to spend the day by myself, maybe take myself to the movies and hang out with my dog.Can you even take a dog to visit a cemetery?

Since his death, I’ve been cut out by a lot of his side of the family because they blame my mom, and from the very few who speak to me, it seems that they don’t blame me, but have decided to cut me out because of my mom. It hurts, because I’m hurting too. I blame myself constantly, and seeing that they blame my mom (who has been depressed and blames herself as well) makes me believe the things I tell myself when I do go down those spirals of guilt, which is a lot.

19dypqp;A friend;macestrogarm;Recently in my small town a trans girl (we’ll call A) died. I knew her before she came out. I understood she was queer even if I didn’t understand what she was going through. In the locker room I interposed myself between her and those who would attack her for being different. She was so nice, bright, and full of love. Unlike me (6’5” and 250+ lbs) she was so small, even then. She didn’t have size or strength as an ultimate deterrent like I did. Eventually we lost touch as I began university - though we still communicated once and a while through my sister (her friend) and my parents (as my sister still lived with them.) My only guess is that after enough time it got to her like it did to the rest of us. I know it’s no way my fault, but I wish I could have done something more. They’re weren’t many of us that were “different” in our small town. POC, queer people, MReligions, and disabled people all faced immense discrimination. I think again and again what might have happened had I been able to stay there and support my peers. I know this does not good and is making use of ample distortions, but she deserved so much better than this. We deserved so much better than this. Every time I visit home there will be one less bright smile at the park, on the bike trail, or even just looking out the window.;Recently in my small town a trans girl (we’ll call A) died.

19dyja9;Accepting my loneliness.;IceBear733;I’m having one of those nights, a heavy sadness piercing, tearing through my chest. I’ve grown acutely aware of my loneliness.I’ve heard many people refer to their spouse as their everything, but that is literally who my wife was to me.I see the world very differently, which has always meant that ‘friends’ just never stuck around. I had a few friends that were different, those type of friends you don’t see for years, but when you see them it’s like nothing changed, you still know and understand each other. I reached out to them during the last few weeks, just the normal ‘Hey how are you doing? We need to go for drinks soon!’. This time I didn’t find old friendships ready for new adventures, only strangers that don’t know how to act around me, scared for some reason that I would break at the site of their beautiful lives, so instead they just pushed me away.There was a time when they would have known that seeing them happy would make me happy, that they wouldn’t find me filled with envy, only  happiness for them.My wife was always concerned with the fact that I didn’t prioritise maintaining friendships, I always replied with “Your friendship is all I need.” And that was the truth, I never needed nor wanted anyone else, she was always more than enough.I don’t regret my decision, especially now. I would be so mad at myself for the time I lost with her because I was “maintaining” friendships with people that don’t want anything to do with me now.Every single second I invested in my wife, will forever be the best investment I made with my time, love and care.If the price I have to pay now is loneliness, I accept it.If you are still reading this, I can only assume that you are going through a similar unbearable pain, I hope you will fight for your happiness and stay strong for your loved ones.If you don’t have loved ones, I hope you find the strength to show yourself the love they would if they were there.Take care of yourself.

19duru4;Sleeplness nights, relationship trouble;pestotheblackcat;"Long post ahead and English is not my first language, beware but thanks to those who read all.      Ten days ago, I lost my older brother. When my parents told me what happened, I was in complete shock. I cried and cried,  but for the first days it felt somewhat tolerable. I know his life was spiraling out of his control for 6 months now, and while his situation appeared not so bad from the outside, he was devoured by a dark anxiety and depression. I know how much he was suffering, and I know that he tried so hard to get better. I tried so hard to help him, and so did his impressive network of friends and his psychiatrist, psychologist and ergotherapist. It is not clear what he had, but he was living a nightmare. I was convinced he was getting better, I was so confident he would make it through, but he did not and I do not resent him for that. I'm incredibly sad and furious at the universe, but those feelings, despite their intensity, are manageable.      But in the last few days, my sleep has vanished. Each and every time I'm about to fall asleep, there is a splitsecond rush of anxiety that jolts me right awake. At first, I could still get a couple of hours in the morning, but last night I could not sleep at all. Sometimes, I feel like I’m choking, or I see ropes hanging in front of my closed eyes (he hung himself). At one moment during the night, I was just terrified, I got up and started to run in the room, yelling from the top of my lungs. I could not tell why, I was not voluntarily. It was both liberating and terrifying, as if I needed to yell like that for 10 more minutes. But I can't make me do it on command.      I'm feeling hopeless. This is already such a hard reality to deal with, what am I going to do if I cant sleep ?    The first nights it happened, I was thinking positive, saying to myself that it would pass. I still am confident it will someday, but for now, it is getting worst. And each night, I was proud of myself for being able to calm down, meditate, change room, to some breathing exercise or whatnot. In other word, I was glad to see I was not panicking and I was dealing with that darkness as it as it came. But it is to no fucking avail, there is no sleep in sight for now and... it is hard no to freak out. Insomnia is one of the first symptoms my brother developed. And can't help but wonder if I am headed for the same dark path.     I guess it is part of the process and I need to be patient. Any similar experience ?    On top of that, my gf whom I love and who is trying to but as supportive as she can, can't seem to manage her own emotions. I know how hard it must be for her to see me grieving (we live together, so she does not sleep well either), but it is stressing me out so much to see her crying that much and beeing so fragile. For instance, yesterday, I told her one of her comment hurt me, and she started to cry. When she cries like that, she becomes distant, unable to communicate and for a God damn long time. And today, she is looking depressed, she is avoiding eye contact, and her presence is... heavy, for a lack of a better word. I tried to tell her she has her right to her emotions and all that matters to me is that we maintain our connection so that we can be there for each other. She seemed to agree and asked if we could cuddle. When we did, for me it was as if I was the only one cuddling her, like she was not cuddling me back. It was like I was offering her recomfort, but not the other way around (well she was basically crying in my arms, being passive). I told her that and that I was sorry and that this kind of recomfort was not something I could offer to her right now. She then grew more distant.       I do not have an once of energy for that. I know it is selfish and I am not the only being whose emotions matter, but I wish she was stronger and more stable emotionally, I wish she could communicate more clearly and make me feel understood in those situations. And more then that, I wish I could be the one being reassured and ""taken in charge"" for like, 2-3 weeks or even a month. And to be clear in the last 10 days, she had been there for me, cuddling me when I cried, raged or panicked. It's just that it is seems like it is rapidly taking a toll on her, a fact I have to guess it from her depressive mood. Then, it is up to me to open the conversation and try to find solutions, as she will not do it.       Now I feel drained, and I wish she was not home. And I feel bad for it, since I know she is trying hard and she is an extremely sensitive and emotional person, trying to work on her emotion management.     I'm sure I'm not the only one dealing with these kinds of frustrations. I'll be glad to hear from your own experiences.

I played one I wrote recently about the months after my stepdads suicide, and before actually singing it I did a trigger warning and explained some things about why I wrote it, specifically how the grief by suicide is still this big taboo and it's so hard to find people who shares your experience. It was the first time that I played it in public, only a few friends and my guitar teacher had heard it before, and I was really nervous. I just kept looking at my notebook and didn't lift my head to look at the public in the whole song. After the performance everyone was so sweet, some people came hug me and thank me and then my friends told me that there was a kid (boy in his early twenties I'd say) that was really fixated and kept looking at me with shiny eyes.After a while, that person actually comes up to me and thanks me for talking about that and explains to me how he lost his father to suicide and so we go on and share some experiences and feelings.And well, it's just the first time that I sing that in public and I feel that it has already done its job.

19daxw7;Post from my wife's blog almost 20 years old;Expensive-Tadpole451;"I'm reading her old blogs. She posted this almost 20 years ago. IDK why. Made me wonder if this was always the end for herThe post she wrote to a friend I was thinking about a conversation we had one time when we both were being nerds and loitering about after school one day. You told me that, in effect, suicide is impossible because we, as humans, have an instinct to live and protect our bodies that we hold above all else, and that this said instinct cannot be overriden. You demonstrated your point by looking away briefly at a clock, then striking your fist at my face. I jumped back, because of that instinct. At that point I think I quit arguing with you as I felt I couldn't articulate any reason to you to prove my point as well as you could.And you were right. We do have an instinct to protect ourselves, from a blow to the face to a tricky virus. But if your body turns against itself, in a manner of speaking, such as in the case of a deadly virus, and the virus cannot be fought off, is it not in the best interest of your body to die rather than continue to be destroyed and perhaps even infect others with what is afflicting you? There are some things we cannot be protected from, be it to a personal weakness or an evolutionary trait that hasn't quite developed yet.And these viruses that have the power to destroy affect our minds as well as our bodies. There are some we just cannot fight away. And when one senses their mind and spirit being viciously attacked and eroding away into a state where the only things left are pain and sadness, then it is in the best interest of the body to die, rather than to allow the virus to continue to replicate and ruin. There _is_ a point where we can no longer fight. It just happens sooner for some of us than others.""Fragments of the dream exploded during my passage through the moats, fell like cutting pieces from dead planets without cutting through the fur and cotton of this silence. The flesh and fur walls breathed and drops of white blood fell with the sound of a heartbeat. I did not want to advance into the silence, feeling I might lose my voice forever. I moved my lips to remember the words I had formed...but I felt they no longer articulated words.""--Anais Nin, The Labyrinth";I'm reading her old blogs. She posted this almost 20 years ago. IDK why.

19da351;Lost My Best Friend Yesterday 1/21/24;Machomann1299;When I moved to New Jersey at the end of 4th grade I had too start over, friends, new school, new town it was overwhelming for me as a young kid. First day of 5th grade I was completely alone and I remember feeling terrible. Then I struck up a conversation with a classmate of mine during recess, her name was Emmy and I'll never forget the conversation we had, it was about the show Mickey Mouse Clubhouse a show we both watched as kids. We talked about how the characters were creepy and that the show in general was trash. We also talked about how I moved from Chicago and how she'd never even been outside New Jersey. Emmy was my first friend in Virginia, and a person I grew extremely close with during my teenage life.Our relationship was strong, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a crush on her. Like an idiot I never was able to muster the courage to tell her and she eventually ended up with someone else. We were incredibly close during Middle School and honestly I trusted her more than my family. In highschool we sort of went out separate ways, we had different friend groups, she had a boyfriend, I remained single but we'd always talk during lunch or by text. Highschool was one of the hardest and darkest parts of my life, (I'm 18 btw). In Sophomore year I failed most of my midterm tests and that, compounded with untreated depression, and a very vitriolic argument with my parents convinced me my life was worthless, so I tried to kill myself. I'll never forget the hallucinations I suffered while under the effects of the DPH I tried to OD on, Seeing my parents cry for the first time in my life, and my friend's reactions to the news. Emmy was hit pretty hard by it and she proved instrumental in helping me recover, along with my parents, and a therapist. With her help I was able to pull myself out of depression and into a happier life, we'd talk for hours and she'd always ask me how I was feeling every day. It helped me to feel loved, cared about. Honestly that's the closest we'd ever been.And then two years later, close to the anniversary of my suicide attempt I get the call from Emmy's mother that she'd cut her wrist and passed away. The happiest girl I knew, someone who hold told me suicide was never a solution to stress or pain, someone who'd pulled me out of the darkest time of my life, someone who made me feel welcome the first day I moved, had committed suicide. Even now I feel angry, with myself and with her. I hate that whatever pain she'd been dealing with I wasn't able to help her like she helped me, and that she didn't come to me to help her. She seemed perfectly fine Friday the day before. It feels like a piece of myself was taken, she was essentially my sister. She didn't leave a note to my knowledge, her parents simply walked into her room and found her. I'll never know what convinced her to take her own life and it's making me cry thinking about it.These past two days have been Hell, I couldn't pay attention in school today, I can't eat, and for the first time In two years I thought about dying. Right now is one of the worst times of my life and I don't have her to lean on. I worry I can't properly convey how much she meant to me and because I don't have siblings I'm unsure if this is a similar comparison, but it feels like I lost my sister. Don't worry about me, I have my parents and friends to talk to and they're helping me, but I feel similarly to how I felt Sophomore year and it fucking hurts. I don't know what I'm going to do now.Emmy, 2/3/06 - 1/21/24;When I moved to New Jersey at the end of 4th grade I had too start over, friends, new school, new to;;2;16;2024-01-22 23:39:57;2024-01-22;Monday;23:39:57;3536;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:18.073001
19d77dx;I’m Always Thinking Too Much;Sen_ri;I lost my husband 5 days ago. We were only married for a year and been together for 3 years. Both active duty military. I was away from home for 9 months out of our single year of marriage. I was angry with him for not being there to pick me up from the homecoming. I was concerned about the distance between us. He struggled to send me emails for some reason I could not understand. He would respond to Snapchat messages right away somehow but I rarely had enough bandwidth or any internet access to message him this way. I was frustrated that he couldn’t just communicate with me in the only way we could reliably do so. I just wanted to talk to him about so many things. I thought he must be underway and failed to tell me. It didn’t make sense that he wouldn’t be telling me how happy he was about my return and picking me up. He seemed happy. He was having fun and making all these new friends at his new submarine. I worried about him. I knew that I needed to protect him. He’d get overwhelmed and struggled to get tasks done. He had anxiety, I knew he needed help with that. I was trying to help. He was a sensitive man. I didn’t want to ever think this could possibly happen. But I’m the only one who could have possibly known. I knew he struggled for some reason I couldn’t understand. I have my own struggles but the thought of death is terrifying to me. I wanted us both to start some sort of therapy. He was extremely resistant to the notion of going to therapy when I brought it up before, but I thought I could reason him into it.I just keep wishing I could have done this or that differently to save him. Looking back on the time we had together some of the things he said that I now see in a new light. Why couldn’t I have just seen it then. Why couldn’t I put it together.He didn’t want to leave the military. I thought it was too stressful. We’d be so much better off leaving. I have 2yrs left. He had re-enlisted so he had another 5yrs to go. No other job seemed suitable to him when I had asked. I had told him he could always rely on me. I could take care of him. And we both have families who love us that we could rely on. He hated the thought of not contributing though. He didn’t want to feel like a burden.He didn’t talk to anyone about his struggles. He was telling people at work about how excited he was for me to come home. There were things we had planned to do together when I finally got home. I just want to make his dreams come true. I want to feel better again. I keep thinking about the future we could have had. I can’t imagine him not being part of my life. It just feels strange.;I lost my husband 5 days ago.

19d25pp;Vant, screaming into the void.. I lost my dad on 4/20/99... lost my adopted brother on 1/16/24;shellee113;"I was four years old when I found my dad after he took his life. It shattered me. My innocence was forever lost. Even at 28... almost 29, I can remember that day clearly. I smell of the house, the fight my parents had that morning, the way the sun shined through the window when I was supposed to be taking a nap. I was too young, and I never really recovered. I watched my biological mom get put in cuffs and blamed for his death. I was dropped in the foster care system to fend for myself. My great aunt and uncle eventually adopted me. They adopted multiple kids, including my baby brother, in March 2002. They brought him home from the hospital because his biological mom was not okay. I watched him grow up; I changed his diapers and told him not to make ridiculous choices. He made everyone laugh. He was the light in the room when everything was bleak. He was my annoying, asshole baby brother. But he wasn't okay; we never knew how bad he felt. He had a premi-son who will be a year old next week. My brother struggled with alcoholism and had a DUI. He couldn't put the bottle down, and in a moment of pain, he took the only way out that he could think of.When my dad died, it left a void I could never fill, but I was too young to really remember him, save that my entire family loves reminding me that I am just like him. My great-uncle is the closest thing to a dad I have left. But the pain I feel with my brother is gone... I knew the moment he left. Before I even got the call. I was in bed, and my heart suddenly ached in a way I had never felt, and I cried my eyes out. I got the call the following morning and confirmed my worst fear, and I fell apart in my husband's arms. He was only 21. He has a baby boy who will grow up without him and looks just like him. I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone.I know that this will eventually get easier over time. But this pain physically hurts. I want my baby brother to come home.  I know my dad is with him and watching over us and his baby boy, but it doesn't make it any better. Everything feels like a blur; I don't even think I have slept an entire 8 hours since I got the call. I have to stay strong for my daughter and other siblings.

I felt that exact same way because of my own mental health for years so I do understand partially but she was the reason I stopped attempting. She told me so many times how much she loved me and needed me here. I knew it would cause her pain if I wasn't and I never ever wanted that. when she first tried to commit, once she started to feel better she always felt guilty for it. she apologized profusely and swore over and over again for months that she was mentally better. it really seemed like that for a long time and so her attempt was very out of the blue and I mean very. I found out after it happened that she had the exact item written down and was looking up tutorials on how to do it before I left to be at my dads for a couple days (she had one bad night but the next day kept telling us she was doing better and would be ok by herself, -  I would go to my dads a lot on weekends with no issue and if she had times where she was upset while by herself she would call and talk to one of us) Her last text to me the day she did it was her telling me she had a good night the night before.  she intentionally wanted me to leave and lied on purpose. I just keep thinking how she kept apologizing over and over again for her initial attempt and what I had to witness back then and that she planned it so intensely and the feeling of abandonment is just so incredibly bad.

19bolp4;5 years without my dad on 1/26;;in 6 days it’ll be the 5th anniversary of my dad’s death. i’m feeling weird about it. sad, but not as sad as i have been before. i’m not hyperventilating and losing my mind like i’m used to. that’s a good thing, in a lot of ways. i can still remember what his voice sounded like, and i can still picture him perfectly in my head the way i remember him. it’s getting harder to hear his laugh when i try. as time passes it feels like he never existed. i hate it. i know i miss him and i loved him and still do. i lost him when i was 18, fairly young i’d say, and i feel like i’ve lived a lifetime without him. he would be proud of me. he would love my boyfriend. and my cats. he missed the birth of my niece, his only grandchild so far. he missed my brother’s wedding. he missed out on seeing my mom finally setting boundaries with her family. i’ve been a million different versions of myself since he died. he’s missed it all and sometimes i feel like i never knew him. it’s like he’s someone that i’ve only heard stories about unless i dig deep into my memories. it doesn’t sting anymore. just an empty hole where he should be.i’m relieved that this is the first year since that i’m not calling off of work for the anniversary because i know that i’ll be grieving too hard to work efficiently. i might shed some tears but my day won’t be ruined. is it wrong to miss when it was like that? i wish we were celebrating his sobriety instead of the anniversary of his suicide. i hung a paper ornament with his name written on it on a Christmas “Death Tree” at a 12 step meeting in december. i still feel cheated. i miss him.;in 6 days it’ll be the 5th anniversary of my dad’s death. i’m feeling weird about it. sad, but not a;;3;13;2024-01-20 23:05:33;2024-01-20;Saturday;23:05:33;1619;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-20 21:08:19.187845

19bbxc2;I lost my husband;Main_Factor_5228;I lost my husband to suicide 2 weeks ago. We were in a fight for 2 days. During those 2 days we did have normal conversations in between our argument. I confess I’m not easy to deal with during arguments and I’m a feisty person. The night he did it, he reached out to a “friend” telling him his plans. I didn’t know about it. At the end of the night, he asked for a fresh start in the morning and I agreed to it. I asked if he was coming to bed, he said yes, and when I woke up, I found him. They think it was impulsive behavior. But why would he do it if he wanted to start fresh?? Was our argument the tipping point? I have also saved him twice from attempts. And has a history of drinking. What is done it at an impulsive decision?I can’t stop thinking maybe I should have been more understanding during the argument. But we have had worse fight.EDIT:thank you for everyone’s kind words. Words cannot express my pain and suffering of my loss. We spent 8 years, this year it will be 9 of our lives together. He was everything to me. I can’t imagine my life without him. Our plans have been ripped away from his acts. Even if he was still here, I would do it all over again, because that’s how much he meant to me. I know he loved me. I have a box full of hand written love letters. I read them all the time.

19ba4ro;My grief has composed of mostly anger;oatmilk_fan;Not towards him, but towards those in his life around him. He was my best friend, and possibly the only person outside of my sister who has ever understood me. I had to limit or end conversations with him because of my ex. I get disgustingly angry when I remember that I allowed that. His other friends had no idea how to be supportive. For them it was, “Just stop bad behaviors,” “Just go to the gym,” “Just stop being sad.” Obviously this won’t work, but each of his friends ostracized him because of their own incompetence. They cornered him into treatment when he was not ready. His band ostracized him when he was no longer a productive source of income to them. He was isolated. Then, these same “friends” create a large, public display of grief for all those to comfort them. The very people who called him “fucked up,” and would laugh at his misfortunes, now suddenly felt they missed him (and made sure it was very public- gotta milk a human’s end of life for their own attention, right?). And then, now that it has been a handful of months, they forgot about him. Their life goes on, while his never will. I wonder what was going through his head in those moments. I wish so badly I could text him. I wish I could hear his voice again. It is especially bad in the deep late night hours, which is when we did the bulk of our talking. We had plans, he wanted to take me to the cutest restaurants. He wanted to explore the city with me. He wanted to show me love. I still can’t believe it sometimes. But when I do, I feel so angry towards those who failed him.;Not towards him, but towards those in his life around him.

19b99it;I can’t stop listening to her favorite song, “How to Save a Life” by The Fray, and it makes me sad and even more guilty every time I hear it.;Throw_awayy_pandas1;I am a male, soon to be, 18 year old. I‘ve been lurking here for a couple of days and I contemplated making a post. I just want to tell someone about this. I’ve mentioned it to one of my close friends, but I think she gets nervous and doesn’t know what to do or say whenever I say anything about it.  Also, sorry about the bad grammar, tense, and audience changes. I kind of just wrote down what I was thinking and feeling.  Beginning of post ——————————————————She would’ve been turning 18 in a few days and her favorite song was “How to Save a Life” by The Fray. A bit ironic considering the meaning of the song. I’ve been listening to just this song on repeat for the past 3 days. I’ve listened to it for somewhere around 200 times and I have yet to get tired of it. I can’t stop listening to it.God, I miss her so much.2 years ago I lost my best friend and girlfriend to suicide. I love her so much and I would give anything to just talk to her for five minutes. To tell her all the things that I didn’t get a chance to. She was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer at 16 with little to no hope for recovery. 3 months later she would deliberately kill herself while drunk driving.She was the best person in the whole world and she meant to much to me. We were best friends and we loved each other more than anything. We were going to graduate high school and go to college together, but the cancer stopped that in its tracks. She was told she had a handful of months left to live. That was the second hardest time of my life, second only to after losing her. She was becoming depressed and many of her friends pulled away. I was there for her every day. When we couldn’t be physically together, we would sit on a call just talking for hours. The worst part of this was seeing her hurting, struggling to tome to grips with the fact that she didn’t have much longer. I guess I was too but I was to focused on helping her to think about it much.I think that I knew she was suicidal.Deep down I think that I knew exactly what she was thinking.On the night of, she called me, drunk, and told me that she loved me. This wasn’t out of the ordinary really, we said it all the time to each other (something that I regret, it kind of softened its meaning because we said it so often). She said that she wanted to just stay on the phone for a little while, not talking, just knowing the other person was there. Eventually she said she wanted to go to sleep and we said good night and said “I love you” to each other. I still remember her last words she ever said to me. “I love you, always”. Later I would learn that she got in her car and drove straight into a barrier, killing herself instantly.After something like this, the song How to Save a Life just hits different. I hadn’t heard it for a while until a few days ago when Spotify put it into a blend I have. And as I listened to it I just broke down sobbing, remembering that it was her favorite song and how the lyrics express what I feel.Lyrics to How to Save a Life by The Fray:Where did I go wrong?I lost a friendSomewhere along in the bitternessAnd I would have stayed up with you all nightHad I known how to save a lifeThis is me.Where did I fail as a friend to let her get to the point where she was even thinking about suicide?I would have stayed up for an entire weak, fuck the consequences, if it saved your life that night. Why didn’t you say something? I knew you were hurting, but I didn’t know it would lead to this.I wish I made you go to sleep with me on the phone still.I wish I came over and stayed with you every night to make sure you were ok.I wish I could’ve had the rest of the time with you. We could’ve had a couple more months, it would’ve been hell for me but at least you wouldn’t have left me before I was ready.Every. Single. Day. That’s when I think about you.In the beginning I’d wake up sometimes and almost call you, a force of habit from when we would talk first thing in the morning after we both woke up.I loved you. I still love you. I will always love you.;I am a male, soon to be, 18 year old.

19b6n7h;Officially a month. Still looking for nonexistent “cure”;KitKaitKlub;It’s been a month now since my uncle killed himself and I keep finding myself waiting for someone to deliver me the secret of how to get him back. Like somehow someone will know what I need to say to bring him back from the dead. I keep finding myself believing that “oh, this is temporary. He might be dead now but he’ll be back later.” It’s so frustrating because I know he isn’t going to be back later. But these waves hit me out of nowhere where I feel so helpless, like, why isn’t anybody doing anything about him being dead? Why aren’t we bringing him back? When I KNOW what dead means. I’m not really angry. It’s just that we were supposed to have so much more time together. He was only 39 and the only person in my family who I think actually liked me outside of my immediate family. We were supposed to watch Indiana Jones together. I was supposed to go to his apartment when I got back to New York. And now he’s just dead. And I really wish he wasn’t. It snowed in New York. I really wish I could ask him about it. I wish I could get ramen with him. I wish he was here. I don’t have any illusions that I could have saved him or changed the outcome, but man it sucks that this was the outcome at all. I just really miss him. He was raised by my parents too. Now there’s one less person in the world who knows what that is like. I wish he would tell me about John Wick or umami or his cat one more time. But no, he’s just dead, and im still in New York, and everything sucks forever now.

19b4dhb;I miss my best friend.;EdenSimpzAgain101;June 10th, 2022 my best friend committed suicide a week before her birthday. We were originally planning that Saturday to watch the old strawberry shortcake show just for fun. Yet we did not get to because she commited before such. I have stuff she’s given me and she had stuff I gave her. Apparently, noticed a few days after her death there was a wreath type thing of a bunch of leather bracelets labeled for me. She wanted me to have them. Her mother originally planned to give me those and a few other items but I haven’t gotten anything. Those bracelets that were meant for me two years ago I never got and I doubt I ever will. I understand that her mother is also grieving and that it will be a hard time for her aswell but her mother was a huge reason to why she commited. Me and my best friend messaged eachother every day before school and after school. We would hang out at each others houses and all that as the typical friends do.I knew she was hurting. I tried to help. I didn’t know how. I was idiotic and unaware. I just miss her so much. I believe spirits still roam the earth after death in whatever way and there have been some paranormal things I believe is her. Including her name showing up. Her name isn’t a common one. I never knew it was a name till I met her. I know she is still present with me in one way or another but it’s not the same. I want my best friend back. I want someone to message every day. Someone to playfully fight with. Someone who never drove me bonkers. Someone who would let me rant and would rant to me. Someone who I knew was my best friend and wouldn’t leave me.

19b3yxs;Dad killed himself after I told him off - and I’m pregnant.;MediumNo7894;Hey everyone - I’ve been a silent watcher on this page for a couple of months now since my dad committed. He hung himself 11/2 after I told him off for dodging court dates (he was in litigation with my mom) and risking getting arrested/thrown out of his house. Prior to this I had not spoken with him for 2 weeks after telling him off over the same issue. I feel terrible. Up until this point I had always defended him to everyone - but he was hurting me and REFUSED to do anything to get better. He wouldn’t get a job, wouldn’t try to date, and was really a shell of the man I knew as my father in my childhood. Seeing him like that always broke my heart but I walked on eggshells for almost a decade to protect his feelings as I was always scared something like this would happen. Well low and behold - I finally stand up for myself/my family and try to get him to do SOMETHING to save himself and instead he fucking kills himself. I feel like shit all the time. I’m so angry at him but I also miss him? I despise him for doing this to me and my two younger siblings (ages 17 and 11) but I also feel awful and like it’s my fault. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about this anymore because I just sound like a broken record. It’s so exhausting and I can’t shake this feeling that it’s my fault because I was too hard on him while he was in a fragile state. It has been my biggest fear for YEARS that this would happen and it finally did. The pain is like no other. AND knowing that he hasn’t contributed to my life or my siblings lives from a responsible parenting or financial standpoint in YEARS and did everything to dodge it yet I still loved him and supported him and this is what I get. I feel so fucking slighted. All while I’m carrying his first grandchild at 23 years old. God I miss feeling normal - I wish I could just forget all of this. It’s like a bad dream. OH and I’m next of kin and left with his mess of an estate to sort through! His final fuck you to me I guess as his number one supporter?????

19afdj3;My husband killed himself 2 days after I left him. Left an angry letter. I don't know how to live with this for the rest of my life.;cryformountains;I'm feeling extremely guilty, but I'm also really hurt, I think what he did is so unfair -- to him and to me. I didn't deserve this pain, I didn't deserve this punishment of constantly grieving, hating myself, blaming myself, after ten years of doing everything to make him happy. I believe he had no malicious intent, he had mental health issues (now I'm guessing in retrospect). What he described was how he actually saw the world, it was his honest truth. Looking back, I realize he was incapable of empathy or introspection -- but he's not the one to blame for how his brain worked.I'm hurting because all of this happened when we were fighting and I left him, our last conversation -- me yelling at him. His last message to me -- rage and anger, blaming me for everything.I'm having so many feelings everyday. I can't just grieve. I miss him and I love him, I feel self pity, I blame myself for what happened, I'm angry that he threatened my mom and decided to punish me in such horrible way, not thinking the rest of my life will be a torture.And also I'm hurting because I have no one to hold accountable for his abuse, and his anger, and his suicide. No one to blame. No one is responsible for all the pain I felt and feel now. I feel alone with my pain. I'm hurting from all those years and what just happened. He left thinking he was the victim, and never understood that I was the victim and it just hurts so bad. I really wish it was different. I wish we calmly divorced and built new happy lives after that. Or stayed together, went to therapy, worked on our relationship, and grew old together.But I don't know how to live the rest of my life with what I have now. I didn't deserve this.

I’m just waiting for the door to open and he walks in like usual.I must’ve text and rang well over 1000 times, his phone doesn’t go to voicemail now it’s already cut off. I’ve so many texts about how ‘all that matters is watching our son grow up together’ and ‘I can’t wait for his firsts’ his firsts are happening, he learned how to pull up today, I can’t even get excited because I shouldn’t be watching this alone. Obviously for my son I’m acting excited and praising at the time but inside me I’m not. He’s just gone, no answers, no warning - well now I’ve read back on every text it looks like there was some I completely missed but he knew he could talk to me about anything so I just assumed he would. Family is a mess and I probably won’t get to go to the funeral. The funeral home has said they strongly advise against a viewing - they can’t say no but if they’re advising against it and I know how it happened I can imagine why they’re saying this. That’s if family even would allow it - probably won’t. Something we bonded over was we were both estranged from family. I am not functioning at all and I need too, I have no choice. We have a baby who has just entered separation anxiety so even if I need 2 minutes to get myself together I can’t without setting him off screaming.I dont understand how he’s just gone. I go in the bathroom there’s 2 toothbrushes. I can’t even go into my bedroom, it’s where I found out and that side of the bed is just empty. The broken sleep I’ve managed has been on the sofa.

198j08q;Struggling with not being enough;Worried_Thought5014;I’ve come a long way the last 8 months since my husband and father of my children took his life. I’ve even recently started seeing someone which is going shockingly well. I’m very forward thinking, looking at going back to school, hanging out with friends. I’m doing my best. I still find myself often getting hung up however on why I wasn’t enough for him to stay. Given what happened I think I would be a better person/partner to him now. I would be less demanding on his time. More supportive of his job. More understanding of his needs. I asked for so much. I had a low self esteem (still do but I’m far more aware of it now) I needed tons of reassurance from him. I can’t help but think my character flaws are why he’s gone. His note said it was his job, that he loved me and I was all he needed - but there’s no way he could’ve believed that and abandoned me right? Our kids?I hate to think his death made me the type of person that he needed too late.;I’ve come a long way the last 8 months since my husband and father of my children took his life.

198bp7d;Sodium Nitrate Suicide;AliBabaCat;Hi my brother ended his life on January 4th, 2024. He’s been trying to do this for the past two years. It started when our dad died 2 years ago on January 1st 2022, and one year breakup he had with his girlfriend. Along with that he’d been having so many other things happening bad in between, the last one was he was getting a new furnace put in his house and the guy setting it up basically blew up the house and he had to move to a hotel with his 3 cats. The hotel is in a golf course but closed for the season, as we live in MN, so it was a real lonely place. He took sodium nitrate on the 2nd-3rd of January and we found him on the morning of the 4th, we couldn’t get a hold of him and it just felt off, his phone was off and he wasn’t online. So we rushed up there where he was, an hour and a half away, he was on the floor a foot away from the door, like I’m thinking he was like “oh shit, I shouldn’t have done this!” He almost looked like he could be woken up, but no, his lips were so purple and he was pretty cold. It was such an odd scene, as next to his bed was a styrofoam cup that he wrote the word “Poison” on it, so why was he by the door? His phone was under his arm and after going through his phone, I saw that he was talking to so many people on text, fb, and messenger, and so many people were cheering him on that he could get through anything and to keep fighting for his life. I’m just gutted by him doing this, he tried also on New Year’s Eve and my mom found him in time and he was in the hospital until the 2nd.I don’t understand why they didn’t keep him? It wasn’t even there 72 hours. He actually ordered this stuff (sodium nitrate) off of Amazon. He was also on a bunch of different suicide forums, I’m so sad, he was my baby brother, by 11 years. He was only 38. The feelings definitely comes in waves, one minute I’m bawling and then I’m just numb. I just want him back! If anyone is out there feeling defeated, alone, sad, know that you’re enough…. You’re a worthwhile person …. Please suicide is not the answer, you can get through hard times, I know, as I have many times. That’s what life is, it’s moments of peace, joy, love, madness, sadness, hard times and good times, it’s just how we respond to all of it.;Hi my brother ended his life on January 4th, 2024.

It's also the first good snow we've had since you died.I didn't feel dread this morning when I looked out the window and saw enough snow to totally screw up any pre-arranged plans we had. I didn't feel fear about what that would mean for me, being stuck in a house with your angry self, unable to go anywhere. Unable to escape. I didn't feel anxious or like I was walking on eggshells trying not to show how I excited I was about the snow in an attempt to not make you mad. I didn't feel the need to immediately start shoveling snow in a desperate attempt to prevent you from doing the same, even when you knew you'd injure yourself.The last couple months have been absurdly hard, and I've missed you. I need your advice and your perspective and you aren't here to give them, but I don't know how to deal with those feelings. How to handle missing you when I also fucking hate you for everything you did. How to handle missing you when I know I would never, ever bring you back, even if I could.

197wrjy;I shelved it but..;Chemical_Machine_970;I think I’ll need to deal with it sooner rather than later.Last night I had these horrific nightmares in which I kept saving a baby boy from the water in the last seconds of his life again and again and again, sometimes as others sat by on their phones right next to him.To clarify it was not my child that took his life, rather the baby of the tight knit group of cousins. It’s been 10 days and the day after I found out I began a second job. My children need me and I’m all they have. Money is an issue (when isn’t it right), so I shelved it.

197f9p1;Are Nightmares common?;AlwaysJust4Now;I have a direct question.  My brother committed suicide on Christmas eve.  Over the couple of weeks or so, I have been having dreams where I interact with him.  Sometimes I'm trying to talk him out of it.

I'm honestly in a state of shock, I don't really know what to do now. Everyone I ever date, if I even try again, will always get compared to him. I mean how do you even explain that to people? I feel like I was lucky enough to meet the one before 30 and now he's just fucking gone, forever. How common is this? Because while all my friends are being amazingly supportive, they admit they have no idea what I'm going through. This is just the fucking worst.

196ztxq;I saw my resident run into traffic;qhoulss;"This is my first post on Reddit, I think. I'm very new to support groups, and I feel guilty for having to get this off my chest. I'm just grateful this seems to be a safe enough space, thank you. (there is mention of child trafficking, just a warning).I worked at a group home in 2023. The home was unique in that the residents living there were young girls in crisis, specifically, girls who have been victims of child trafficking. I took the job because I have a history of assault and trafficking; I felt I could offer a sincere comfort for the residents, showing them that I had not only survived but turned out pretty alright.   There was a resident there, fifteen years old (the same age I was when it all happened to me), named ""Onyx"". Onyx had a difficult upbringing and a severe history of self-injury. I'm not too comfortable giving away so much about Onyx's personal life because she's no longer here and I still want to respect her privacy, but she had been through a lot.  I didn't tell her how much of her personal strifes, trauma, or diagnosis we shared in common because I didn't want to risk her becoming co-dependent as her caregiver, but I definitely made sure to treat her the way I needed to be treated growing up. Her and I bonded rapidly. The home had very strict rules, but I often bent them to allow her things like watching Nightmare Before Christmas (our favorite Halloween movie) for Halloween, eating candy bars for snack time, or being able to talk to me after lights out if she needed. It was also easy to do this for her as she was one of two residents in the home at any given time (most other residents stayed with us on average 7 days, but Onyx ended up being with us for over two months). Onyx was charismatic, creative, expressive yet shy. She was a girl I looked forward to seeing every time I came into work, and she made sure to return the love when we saw each other.   In late November, early December Onyx started to change. It wasn't unusual for Onyx to show depressive symptoms given her diagnosis, but this was different.The home had another resident who had ran away with her ""pimp"" and Onyx was very clearly envious of her. She believed that ""Chanel"" was living lavishly. Chanel was seventeen, and had been braggadocios of her ""lavish"" life outside of the home. When Chanel ran away, that's when Onyx started to change. I had gotten a promotion at the home the first weekend of December, so my responsibilities had doubled. However, I felt extremely unsure of myself because I was young and inexperienced; I was barely qualified enough for the position I had already. I accepted the promotion though because I needed the money. On the second day of my promotion, I went into work that night despite having the night off as requested. When I got there, it was only one other staff and two girls including Onyx. I was a bit overwhelmed and nervous, but I was determined to get through the night. Onyx started complaining of an ear ache, wanting medical attention. I asked her why she hadn't gone to urgent care earlier in the day when they offered, but she said she thought we were too understaffed to ask. (we were understaffed at the time, so I believed her). My boss told me to continue to treat her at home  with over-the-counter and warm compressions. Then, Onyx fainted. I was out of the room when she did, but my co-worker radio'd me immediately.  I called 911, and rushed to give Onyx first aid. She was responsive, but I did notice that she needed medical attention. EMTs arrived and assessed her, offering to transport her to the emergency room. I had to wait for my boss to give the answer on if she was going to the ER or not. My boss okay'd the trip to the ER via-ambulance, however, there wasn't a plan in place on how that would work logistically with only two staff members on duty. In all the hectic confusion, my co-worker got overwhelmed and quit leaving me with two girls; one who needed to go to the ER and I couldn't bring the other with me. My co-worker said she'd stay until someone on-call came to relieve her, and I ultimately went with Onyx in the ambulance. She had asked me for her iPod, but I couldn't find it.  While in the ambulance, I had kept reassuring Onyx that she was loved and I apologized for how hectic it was to get her to the doctor's. I told her that the next time she felt like she was in pain, not to worry about us being ""understaffed"" to go to urgent care when it's offered. We told each other we loved each other. Turned out, Onyx had a severe ear infection but on her diagnosis sheet it implied that the infection came from an injury. The possible ways to get the injury were from being exposed to excessive water. We didn't have a pool or anything like that, so I became suspicious that she injured her own ear while showering and made a mental note to talk to her later.   My boss met me at the emergency room to give Onyx and I a ride back to the group home in her car. 10 minutes en route back to the house, Onyx opened the car door. My boss pulled over, we were both grabbing for Onyx to keep her in the car. However, she made it out of the car onto the shoulder and I got out after her, running and screaming her name. The highway we were on was very dark, very quiet and desolate. We were running for not even a minute when another car was coming down the highway and Onyx ran off the shoulder and straight into the car. I saw her get hit. I ran to her side, I don't remember when but I had called 911 already. Apparently, I banged on the driver's door telling him to turn on his hazards and call 911. I even stopped other on-coming traffic and told them to do the same. I got lucky that an off-duty doctor was on the highway, pulled over and came to assist me in CPR. I don't know how long we were giving CPR, but I was giving her breaths with no film. I had to hold her, trying to breathe into her mouth, but I knew when I saw her get hit that she had died. When we were relieved by EMS, I looked at the driver and he was just a kid. So, I held him and told him to call his family trying to reassure him that this wasn't his fault.   Once all of the sirens were there, I finally fell apart and looked around and my boss hadn't gotten out of the car. I almost fainted before I felt my boss grab me and push me into the car and cried with me. The entire staff was mortified and torn by the news. When I finally got home that night, I saw myself in the mirror and I had her blood on me. My mouth burned and I had to brush my teeth a million times. The weeks that followed were painful, angry, confusing and eventually I went numb. My bosses wanted to make Onyx's passing ""worth something"" by implementing a bunch of changes and policies and everything like that. I was so angry. I couldn't believe that it took Onyx's passing to see so many necessary changes that could have prevented her suicide. I tried to return to work, but it was way too difficult. I was cleaning the drawers, finding Onyx's iPod and I quit.   It's been barely over a month since Onyx passed away, and she's remembered in the news as ""A Ward of The State"". However, she was so much more to me. The police had wrongfully cited me as her mother because I kept wailing about ""my baby"" when they finally arrived. She was my baby, I loved her. I have panic attacks regularly, am always haunted by my job at the group home and the gruesome images of seeing Onyx getting hit. I'm constantly terrified of what's coming next. I still wake up in the middle of the night thinking I need to get to her or go to her. I see the whole scene playing out when I blink and I just feel like I let her die. I was able to give a statement to the young boy who hit her's insurance and I feel like I was able to help him with that, but I hope he reaches out and I can help even more with that I can't imagine what he's experiencing. I feel like I've failed Onyx, and I've taken someone's daughter/granddaughter from them. I can't talk about this with my friends or family because it's so heavy and I feel terrible leaving this for anyone else to carry.   I hope I haven't broken any rules, please delete if I did.

She had a massive block of complexes and fears. Her mom was... how do i put it... not great. She was insulting her about her weight, although she was already underweight.Then, one day i asked what she ate in the last week. She ate a lot of pills and nothing more. And this would go on for a whole year. Until, four days ago she sent me a message at ~3-4 am, saying that she was so thankful for everything. That night, she stepped out a 13-story building's window. Her mother is being held responsible, but now i am just so burnt out. The problem being i have neither friends, nor a psychologist.

196spom;'Don't let her life be defined by her death';JusHarrie;Ever since my mother took her life in October, in the interest of comforting me, a few people have told me that I shouldn't let my mother's entire life and history be defined by the fact that she chose to take her life and the way she died. It doesn't annoy or upset me, I actually find this a really kind and productive thing to say. She was alive for 58 years and did many things she wanted to do (she refused to do anything otherwise), she has a full history and although she died too soon, she did do more than take her own life. When I die, I also do not want to be defined by however I go, I want to be remembered for how I spent my time over how many years, the memories I have with people and how I made people feel. The issue is though as much as I like and agree with the ideology...I just cannot achieve it, as I feel her death defines everything. It was such a horrible way to go, she was alone and depressed, she chose that she wanted to die, and died sad, how can I not let it be so defining when it is so shocking, upsetting and unforgettable? I cannot allow myself to think about the good and happy times because of how horribly sad her death is, and the fact that our relationship suffered and that she was emotionally abusive. So our 'good' times were actually me biting my tongue and repressing how I felt, when she could say what she liked to me and I just had to keep schtum to prevent an argument. I finally stood up to her when she screamed down the phone at me, I go no contact, and then less than a year later she choses to die. 💔It's just all complex to deal with. I want to holistically celebrate and honor her life but it hurts so much for so many reasons, that I've officially found that I absolutely can't avoid letting her be defined by her death. 😞;Ever since my mother took her life in October, in the interest of comforting me, a few people have t;;5;31;2024-01-14 22:48:05;2024-01-14;Sunday;22:48:05;1780;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-18 21:06:30.204124

1969kmj;My Mom died when I was 11;InothingU;When people ask me what happened, I always struggle with what to say. Let me explain…my mom attempted suicide several times before she actually passed. Most people who go through this and accomplish ending their own life, usually pass immediately or within a short period of time. One can definitively say “my loved one passed via suicide.”  However, my mom made an attempt in February of the year she attempted. She effectively put herself in a persistent vegetative state. She passed the following January, 11 months after the initial attempt. What do you say? She died by suicide? She died from complication of a suicide attempt?  I have long accepted the fact that she took her own life. This is generally what I tell people. I rarely give the back story. But damn those 11 months were the hardest on 10-year old me. Later this month will mark the 40-year anniversary of her passing. I miss her all the time. 💔;When people ask me what happened, I always struggle with what to say.

1967hmf;Day 23 since my nineteen yr son took his life. I’m still in shock. Grief. Guilt.;JungFuPDX;My only son. The light of our lives. The happiest baby. The most joyful child. I always said “I never have to worry about him, he’s my good one” (my lovely now 28y daughter gave me  a run for my money in HS)He had a rough couple of years in HS - Covid hit and he isolated with his gf. He stayed over at her place a lot. He admitted later he did a lot of acid and thought it “broke” his brain. We had found him a great therapist. He was body building, graduated HS and was accepted and attended school overseas. I knew the gf was there too but he convinced me that going there was for him. He told me later it was a lie. He only wanted to be with her. Long story but they broke up and he took it so hard. I told him he could come home, or switch schools. He could go to any country he wanted. I called him every day. He said he was ok, that he could stick it out. He said her betrayal was unforgivable and he was moving on. He wanted to come home for Christmas break. Our whole family was thrilled. He went to see everyone .. to say goodbye? None of us knew. I was with him having dinner the night he did it. He held my hand all night. Talked about switching to law school which I had always thought would be a great path for him. He’s so smart. Funny. Handsome. Charming. The whole world was his. His father called me the next morning and said he found him in the backyard next to the tree we planted the week he was born. He had asked me about the tree that night. I found his note two days after his funeral. Saying he couldn’t go in without her. How I was the best mom ever and he was so sorry, that I didn’t deserve this. To tell his little sister he was in an accident. How did I not see the signs? So many little things come together now but .. I just didn’t know. We were all in shock. His friends, family, everyone .. He left journal entries talking about his pain. He was fighting it - he wanted to win. He just didn’t tell anyone. His last entry was a will - asking what to do with his remains. Who gets his ashes. I can’t stop thinking about his words. I can’t stop having nightmares. I can’t get over at what point I could have helped or if he needed me more? He said it was about the girl .. but why? I just don’t understand still. If you’re reading this thank you. I have support. Therapists. Grief counseling, friends .. but it’s all so much. I have to be strong for my family but I just want to curl up in my bed and cry. There’s so many questions- so much pain. How do I go on? Im rambling I know .. it’s just so hard. Im flying this week to his school to collect his things, talk to the dean, try and figure out international banking nightmares - this is a nightmare and I just can’t wake up.;My only son.

1965qbz;No one talks about the partner when a parent commits suicide.;No_Problem8197;"My father committed suicide on Christmas and I want to talk about it. I'm in therapy, I have my friends and family's support and I know I have my boyfriend's support. He is present. But every time I open up about what happened it triggers him (although he has never experienced something similar) and either shuts me out or you can tell he is seemingly uncomfortable. He even once asked me to not talk about him because once he got extremely high and was extremely upset cause he started thinking about him; they weren't that close; I mean... they liked eachother but then again they were as close as any father and daughter's boyfriend would be. I thought it was kind of ironic but seeing how he was so upset I comforted him. And due to his strong reaction he asked me not to talk about him since. I thought this was extremely unfair since the way I saw it is as if at some level he is making me somewhat responsible for his strong reaction while being extremely high. After a little back and forth I still complied seeing how upset it made him. So... what should I do if my partner can't give me what I want/need in this traumatic time? I need two things his prescence; check, but I also need a shoulder to cry on, an ear to talk to. Is it valid to try to substitute this need to talk to somebody with my friends and family rather than my boyfriend? Is it healthy for a relationship? Should I even stay if he doesn't care enough or is incapable of being that person? Also, I asked for him to acompany me to spread his ashes for support, he said he thinks it would be best if I had that time alone. Maybe he is right. I ask, was it insensitive for him to decline? Was I asking too much of him to attend something so personal? I mean then again we've only been 1.5 yr together, maybe that's too soon/inappropriate to bring things this heavy although unexpected but still? I'm not even sure if it's a lack of caring or a lack of capability. Maybe he is too weak. I just don't know what to think or what to do. I guess my main question is what do you do when your partner is limited in complying in a time of need?Update: just talked to my boyfriend about the situation, how I felt and what I need from him which is to hold accountability, a genuine apology and to better handle this kind of stuff in the future as I need a reliable partner and if he doesn't know to ask for help with loved ones or even his therapist and gain the tools. Initially he got defensive and we started fighting for a short period of time until I broke things off saying that I did not intend to bring this up to make him feel bad but to be heard and understood and ultimately understand where he is coming from and navigate things together. Then he calmed down, told me his situation and finally showed some remorse taking accountability and gave me an apology which seemed genuine. I thought I would feel relief, but even though I feel better I also feel strange, something about him getting defensive while expresing myself and showing vulnerability hit me the wrong way even if he ended on the right note. I mean, I understand, it's natural to get defensive when you are not placed under a nice light but I just don't know what to make of this. What should I do? Should I just give myself some time until this feeling goes away?";My father committed suicide on Christmas and I want to talk about it.

1963s3l;My father committed suicide when I was 17;lysergiderdream;TW for suicide, parental abuse and depression.This is my first post on here. I'll be honest, I don't even know how reddit works. I told my friend I wish I could find a community of people who have lost loved ones to traumatic suicide and he sent me a link to this sub reddit.I am almost 22 years old. In October of 2019, when I was just 17, my father committed suicide by slitting his throat open in my livingroom just before I had to go to school. He was still alive when I found him. Prior to his suicide, he had abused me for over a decade in physical, mental, emotional and psychological ways. His abuse ontop of his horrific suicide has left me mentally and emotionally crippled for years. I keep seeing gore everywhere no matter how hard I try to curate a safe space for myself online. I am so tired of living with the C-PTSD that I developed from prolonged childhood abuse and his suicide. No one I knows has lost a loved one, especially an abuser, to a suicide like this. I just don't want to feel alone anymore. I've had people ask me why I'm not over it yet, and I just can't imagine I truly ever will be over this. It haunts me everywhere I go. It keeps me awake at night. I can't close my eyes sometimes. I can't even look at my friends throats without seeing my father's throat cut right open. I feel very angry at him for abusing me and ending his life in such a horrific way because it truly has crippled my everyday life. I cant enjoy the things I used to enjoy. I can't even play the games I used to love. I can't look at ny old drawings because I used to draw horror/slasher gore. I am so tired of living like this. I just wanted to feel less alone. I'm sorry if this post is incomprehensible I've had a very very very long week compiled of PTSD breakdowns/flashbacks and crying. I just wanted to put this out there and hopefully someone will understand. I am so sorry if you have also lost someone to a suicide this way, it's an incredibly psychological destroying thing to remember and think about.

I'm not crying every second but I definitely can't stop thinking about him. When I met him I was 14 going on 15, and me and him were in boarding school in the same boarding house. He and another friend got me to train often at the pull up bars and me and him would hang out often after school just walking around, chatting. He was about 16 at the time of meeting him. I loved this dude so much. He was the big brother type for me and I really appreciated his insight and humor. He reminded me alot of myself in the way I spoke and the amount time we spent as teenagers was something ill never forgot. It was only a year but I would often be in his dorm during the day / if we were both in on the weekend I would just hang out with him and play video games like rocket League or watch him play dark souls. Fuck dude I'm actually starting to tear up writing this. I only hung out with him one more time when I turned 16 after I left boarding school. Then I never saw him again. That was 2017, and I haven't seen him since then. We also didn't really talk outside of him following me on Instagram and commenting & liking my posts there. I just found out from another friend from boarding school he took his life in part because of his bad schizophrenia September 2023. This was yesterday. I feel so bad and I can't stop thinking about him. He was such a good dude. And I wish I saw him one more time. I remember the last time I saw him we sat on the couch with a few other friends together and I rested my head on his shoulder out of the bromance we had and it felt nice. But I know I'll never ever get to see him again. It sucks. I miss you Milan. I really cherish the memories I have of you. I'll always remember you. Sorry your brain had to sabotage you.

I told myself I was gonna say something to them, something like “oh hey I love your sticker, I saw my brother right after he killed himself so it’s pretty funny”. I sorta zoned out and then came to when I saw them getting in their car. I just backed out of my spot, sorta looked at her, and just drove away. she didn’t see me or anything, I was just background noise in her life. Idk what the point of this is. Just wanted to vent, thank you.;I was walking out to my car leaving a store, and I saw a car parked sorta behind mine with probably ;;18;64;2024-01-12 03:42:54;2024-01-12;Friday;03:42:54;855;Reddit;suicidebereavement;SuicideBereavement;2024-04-17 21:06:20.606142

194baai;More funerals, I miss my brother;Sweaty_Conclusion_25;I’ve had a shit year. December 22 a distant friend of mine died and I took it hard, january 1st 2023 my grandpa died, Mother’s Day 23 my brother committed suicide which is the worst of everything for me by far, and last night my other grandpa died. I’m so sad, I’m so so sad. Literally a year ago I was with my brother at my grandpas funeral. Now I have to go to our last one, and without him too. The amount of people who really love me in this world keeps on getting smaller, and I wish I could escape this pain. Not having ideation/thoughts, I just am so tired of this and it’s so upsetting. Grandpa was one of the only people who still checked on me, and I have to wonder why he just lived long enough to see the devastation of my brothers suicide, only to die less than a year later. That seems unfair. My family is smaller and smaller, and I really miss my brother;I’ve had a shit year.

194arzu;A rant about grief;Wonderful_Variety598;It was my birthday yesterday. I lost my mum suddenly due to a blood clot after an operation in August 2021. She raised me and my brother as a single mum from when I was 6, she was my best friend and we were the three musketeers. I lost her after having an operation on my ankle, which felt major at their time, I was still in the cast when she has died from her leg operation.I lost my partner, the father of my child, whilst I was pregnant, 36 weeks pregnant, due to suicide. I say due to suicide but it was actually a brain injury in February 2022 that caused him to take his own life in October 2022. It’s a long story, all of it has much more context than the average human could ever imagine. I turn 29, I have my daughter, I have my furbabies but I do not have my mum and the love of my life. There is no reason to it, I try to understand it and the majority of the time I accept I won’t, but there are moments where I really wish I could. I want to feel celebrate, I want to move on… I feel like I need to do this as well as want to but it always always holds me back. I don’t know if it’s the guilt or if it’s the weight of the responsibility that make me feel like I can’t. I mean I’m not suicidal, I was but I am not now, I’d never ever voluntarily leave my daughter and orphan, not when I know I have love and wisdom to give her…I just find grief a trap… one minute you think your doing ok and moving on and the next minute your debating your existence. It’s not talked about enough, it’s not understood, I get we would never understand it but my god can we talk about it.;It was my birthday yesterday.

194aihg;Anyone else feel less connected to their family afterwards?;That_Pie_4821;I feel like they just don’t get it. My sibling and I are the only ones I feel whose lives were truly impacted by losing our father. I tried to connect with my aunts, uncles, and cousins afterwards but I’ve always sensed a coldness from them. They’re all rich, privileged people and don’t know where I’m coming from (my parents were both poor with mental health problems). All my cousins are spoiled and never had to deal with hardship. I feel disconnected from them all. I don’t even want to bother anymore. I feel worse about myself when I’m around them bc they have so much more than me. My grandma constantly reminds me of how alone I am.I feel truly alone. I’m the only one who can care for myself. My mother has mental health problems too. My sibling is so far away and also handled things better than I did. I feel so depressed and alone. I feel like I’ll carry this grief forever and don’t know if I’ll ever be ok.;I feel like they just don’t get it.

19460ak;Knocked over by the wave;peekaboooobakeep;Getting ready to move house and I just got knocked down by a grief wave.  One of the last memories I have of my brother was him helping me move. He was always the guy that would help out. I wish I had him here to listen to my neurotic mind loops of to do lists and he'd tell me to chill and not worry.  Then it went to thinking about how he'd be responding to the world. He passed nearly 6 years ago so he's missed out on a lot. He never got to meet his nephew that was probably conceived the week he died, my grief masked early pregnancy symptoms and I was very unwell with my grief trying to carry a child that my trauma brain was screaming at me that I'm only going to have this little boy and he'll only reach the same age as my brother at 20 and then something horrible would happen. He might be on my mind more with his birthday coming up too. He was such a sweet boy and stayed sweet. He never had a nasty teenager phase, he was never too cool for his family. Maybe because we were all older by a lot and he was always hanging out with us older siblings. My experience was we were blindsided completely. Never having a mental health diagnosis outside of ADHD.  He also had a history of multiple concussions, from sports and Jackass style hijinks. There wasn't anything acute....I got screenshots from the last person that spoke to him literally hours before and it was so mundane and included future plans to purchase a used project vehicle. We had been talking about road tripping together for a family members wedding a couple states away. There was no obvious reason for him to take his own life and I struggle with that part. I've had trouble with my own mental health since childhood and I can relate to having those feelings and I can see people who are struggling and gravitate towards them my whole life. I couldn't feel this. Blindsided. I'm glad we have this space to vent and scream into the void. I'm sorry we've all met this way but I appreciate all of you and am so sorry we all have to struggle with this.;Getting ready to move house and I just got knocked down by a grief wave.

194257e;When will it not be the main thing to talk about anymore?;Jasper0906;I know I'm early days, barely 5 months since my little brother left us. But I wonder, when will I get to the point where I can talk to people about how life's going, without the innate pressure in my heart to talk about my brother and how I/my family am dealing with it? When I can I meet new people, without feeling like I'm deceiving them if I don't tell them about my brother? I feel like I'm lying about my life if I don't mention that my brother took his life. It's not necessarily that I need to TALK about it, but feel like they should know. I'm single since few years back, and only recently got out on the dating scene again, was in a bit of a situationship with a guy for a few months before all of this happened. He ghosted me after the funeral. I know he's a POS but I also wish he wasn't because I could've talked to him then, because he was there when it happened..  When will I be able to get back out there without feeling like this is one of the main things they need to know about me? Sorry for the ramble.. I'm just so frustrated at the moment.;I know I'm early days, barely 5 months since my little brother left us.

I needed to understand and to see.We lost a very dear family member on 1/5.  Tomorrow is the wake, Saturday the funeral.  My husband has not come to terms with it.  He doesn’t think the funeral will be that bad.  I’m sitting here having a panic attack trying to figure out how to manage this.  See on 1/1 I attempted.  No one knows.  Now, I get to go to his funeral and see what it would have been like if I had succeeded.  My daughter asked why he did it, I know why, but cannot explain it to her.  I actually asked why as well.  One of my boys said, but mom he was always happy.  😭We are devastated and heartbroken.  Everything feels so scattered, I cannot even express myself right.  Family is flying in from all over the US.

193srgi;Broken heart syndrome;tiner6907;"I lost my husband on 11/4/23 by suicide. I was the one who found him and life as I knew it was shattered. There are times where I've felt overwhelmed and other times I feel like I'm handling things reasonably well. In the past several weeks, I've experienced a couple of panic attacks, usually at night when it's quiet and my mind starts to wander. I'm seeing a psychologist who gave me some coping strategies and this has helped. Then yesterday,  out of nowhere, I experienced a painful tightening of the chest, nausea, cold sweats, and pain radiating through my jaw and neck. My first thought was, ""Is this it? Is this a heart attack?"" Should I go to urgent care or the ER? I didn't want to call for an ambulance, since the last time EMS came was the day i found him dead. My son lives close, so he was my first call - as it was the day Mike died. ""I need you"" was all I had to say and he was here in just a few minutes. At the ER, the staff was quick and courteous and I had an EKG, an x-ray and bloodwork. During my visit I was asked if I had anything else going on that might be causing anxiety and I couldn't answer through my tears, so my son answered for me - that I'd recently lost my husband. The nurse very sweetly said ""broken heart syndrome is a real thing."" Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions.I had no idea. EKG and x-ray looked good, and bloodwork confirmed no damage to my heart, it's just 💔.";I lost my husband on 11/4/23 by suicide.
